26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,420
♫ I can't help ♫

27
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:52,366
We are finally adults who met the parents.

28
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,066
I cracked my brain to make myself another person.

29
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,400
Still, I was recognized by Su Mu's mother at first glance.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,766
Aren't you the girl who bought the goldfish last time?

31
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,800
I am worried that aunt will misunderstand me because of the goldfish.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,300
I'm sure your IQ is not low.

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
This is good for the next generation.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
But it quickly made me relaxed.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
My portfolio passed the preliminary test.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,433
Everything is developing in the best direction.

37
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,733
But when I think that I'm going to Beijing for an interview,

38
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,766
I feel very reluctant.

39
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,533
It's all because of Su Mu's flirting.

40
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,733
I don't want to be separated from him even for a day.

41
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,866
Please come again.

42
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,700
Mu Mu, bring me another bowl.

43
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:48,500
Why are you here? Didn't your sister say you are quite busy these two days?

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,033
Yes, quite busy. I have a business trip tonight.

45
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,416
On a business trip? Where are you going?

46
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,333
Beijing. Beijing?

47
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,680
Ah, then how many days will you be there?

48
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:08,933
- Three days.
- Three days…

49
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,766
What time is your flight?

50
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,333
6:00 in the evening.

51
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,300
6:00? Hurry up then.

52
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,116
So, I have to rush over to accompany you.

53
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,966
Anything for me to help with?

54
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,266
- No, no…
- I'll help.

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,500
De De,

56
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,333
I finally understood the principle you said previously.

57
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,966
You said, it's okay to like someone.

58
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:28,633
But most importantly, that person has to like you.

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,266
Mu Mu, I didn't mean to intentionally display affection in front of you.

60
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,800
I really didn't notice you were beside me.

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,366
You're so cruel.

62
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,033
It was just a joke.

63
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,700
It's my first time falling in love, I don't know either.

64
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,733
Falling in love is not learned.

65
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:51,066
I have deleted all the official accounts.

66
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,566
I now feel that falling in love is based on feelings.

67
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,233
It's all based on feelings?

68
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:04,166
Then do you think I should go to Beijing for the interview?

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,033
This… um…

70
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,333
I really don't know.

71
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
[I reached Beijing.]

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
[Going for a meeting now.]

73
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
[Okay, good boy.]

74
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:40,300
Little crab, are you bored here today?

75
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,966
I think you are quite bored.

76
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:46,000
Why don't we go and play today?

77
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,100
Busy man, are you done busying to have time for me?

78
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,900
I just arrived at the hotel.

79
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,200
Do you miss me?

80
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,066
I waited for you the whole day.

81
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,116
I miss you so much.

82
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,266
Miss me but you won't let me go to Beijing with you.

83
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to keep you company. You'll be bored alone.

84
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,300
Won't you be back that night? Then it won't be boring.

85
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,666
What do you want to do at night?

86
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,283
What do you want to do?

87
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:19,000
W-W-What are you doing?

88
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm taking a shower. Getting ready to sleep.

89
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:28,266
Oh, yes. You are so tired today.

90
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,290
It's time to take a bath and sleep.

91
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,866
Go ahead.

92
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,766
Hey, wait.

93
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,966
I haven't told you about something.

94
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,699
What's wrong?

95
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,766
Oh, I suddenly forgot what I have to say.

96
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:55,466
You go to bed now. I'm resting too.

97
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,666
Go to bed then. Goodnight.

98
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,866
Uh. Goodnight.

99
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,000
He definitely did it on purpose.

100
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,900
Did I get fooled because of this?

101
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,400
Isn't this…

102
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,066
just showing your upper body?

103
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,600
That's nothing.

104
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,700
The abs look quite good, isn't that so?

105
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,433
Mom.

106
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,933
I am going to Beijing today.

107
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,500
Isn't your interview tomorrow?

108
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,033
Su Mu is in Beijing.

109
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,266
This is a little inappropriate.

110
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:18,866
You both come and go at home, being together every day, that's fine.

111
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,500
After all, we adults are at home.

112
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,500
If it's outside, a boy and a girl alone in a room,

113
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,900
how can that be?

114
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,966
Mom, what are you thinking? We have lived together a long time ago.

115
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,666
Nothing happened.

116
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,466
When did you both live together?

117
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:41,533
When I didn't come home at night, I lived with him.

118
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
How can you both do this?

119
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,233
Su Mu is not that kind of person.

120
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,966
What about you?

121
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,033
I-I?

122
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,066
I am not that kind of person.

123
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,616
How could I be that kind of person?

124
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,700
Mom, would you let me go?

125
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:07,533
If Mom doesn't allow you to go, wouldn't you still go?

126
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,700
Mom just wanted to tell you.

127
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,200
You must know what you should do, and what

128
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,100
you shouldn't do.

129
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,333
I know. We are all grown-ups.

130
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:26,633
My point is… We adults know what to do and what not to do.

131
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:30,050
Okay, Mom, read your book. I'm going to pack up.

132
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:36,066
Youngsters nowadays.

133
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,266
Why did you call me so early? Aren't we meeting at night?

134
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:52,833
This blueprint, I've spent all night modifying it. After this, you will be responsible.

135
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,533
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to Xing Yue City.

136
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,016
Why are you going back in such a hurry?

137
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,033
Ah, I got it. Hey, I can't do it alone.

138
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,300
Why are you like this every time?

139
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:17,966
Master, to the airport.

140
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,400
Master, to the airport.

141
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:38,500
- Hello.
- Hello, little Su Su, where are you?

142
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,599
I… am in Beijing.

143
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,911
How about you?

144
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm in… the ice cream shop.

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Uh, I was so busy in the shop today.

146
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
How about you?

147
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,366
Um, I was quite busy today.

148
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:56,866
I won't be seeing you today, right?

149
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,333
You can see me if you want to.

150
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,833
Video doesn't count.

151
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,500
You can't touch it.

152
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,050
Then… what time are you going back to the hotel today?

153
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,733
Um… 6:00.

154
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,333
6:00? Just right!

155
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,466
What just right?

156
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:16,433
I mean it's great. You can go back to the hotel at 6:00.

157
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,966
I'll send you a video when you're back at the hotel.

158
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,566
Don't run around, I know where you are.

159
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,766
Okay.

160
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,000
See you at 6:00.

161
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,700
See you at 6:00.

162
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,050
Master, please speed up a little.

163
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,800
Wow.

164
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Ah, hello.

165
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,766
May I know what is the room number of Su Mu, Mr Su?

166
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:15,133
Sorry, our hotel has rules.

167
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,200
We cannot simply disclose our guests' room information.

168
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
I am his girlfriend.

169
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,866
We can't disclose too. How about you give him a call?

170
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,666
But I want to surprise him.

171
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,366
Wouldn't there be no surprises then?

172
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,566
- So, please…
- I am so sorry.

173
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:29,999
So sorry.

174
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,166
Okay.

175
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,566
Hello.

176
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:42,199
Hello. Where are you?

177
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,833
Hey, forget it, I'll tell you.

178
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,700
- I'm in Beijing for the interview.
- What?

179
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,966
- You are in Beijing?
- Yes.

180
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:53,300
I am at your… hotel.

181
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,633
Are you surprised?

182
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:59,833
I wanted to surprise you but I don't know your room number.

183
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,300
Where are you?

184
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm at the ice cream shop.

185
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,166
W-Where?

186
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,083
Modern Sweet, Sweet Ice Cream ice cream shop.

187
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,700
Really?

188
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Are you surprised?

189
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,900
I am… so shocked.

190
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,866
Stand where you are and don't move.

191
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,199
Okay.

192
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,299
Tian Tiande.

193
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,300
Why are you suddenly here?

194
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm here to take the exam and to find him.

195
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,700
You two are really weird.

196
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,300
He spent the night modifying the blueprint so that he could go back to find you.

197
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
You still came to him? So dramatic.

198
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,410
Really?

199
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,331
It's fake.

200
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,100
It must be real.

201
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,666
This is where Su Mu usually stays.

202
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,666
All his things are inside.

203
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:20,500
Although he is not here, but it's full of his scent,

204
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,800
I believe you shouldn't feel lonely.

205
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,433
Enough.

206
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,833
I'll leave first if there is nothing else. Call me if there's anything.

207
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,566
It's better not to call.

208
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,233
Thank you.

209
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,499
Wow.

210
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,800
Doggie.

211
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Sit here.

212
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,233
Work.

213
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,366
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,200
Have you made it in?

215
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,366
How is it? Are you still used to it?

216
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:51,966
- Not used to it.
- Not used to it?

217
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:56,433
Then… do you want me to change a room or a hotel for you?

218
00:19:56,433 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm not used to being at your place without you.

219
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,533
I didn't expect you would come to me so suddenly.

220
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,066
I wanted to surprise you.

221
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:15,400
We just missed each other like that.

222
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,366
- What time do you wake up tomorrow?
- 8:00

223
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,366
All right, I'll wake you up.

224
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:35,466
- Don't need to. I'll set the alarm clock myself. I can get up.
- No!

225
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,166
- I'm calling you.
- Okay.

226
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,233
After finishing your exam, I'll pick you up at the airport.

227
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,721
Okay.

228
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,300
Sleep well.

229
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,299
Okay.

230
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,466
I miss you.

231
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:49,599
Okay…

232
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,033
I miss you as well.

233
00:20:57,566 --> 00:21:00,433
My doggie.

234
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:50,633
The above are all my works. Thank you.

235
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,500
Actually, this is not another recruitment.

236
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,066
You are not here to replace the spot.

237
00:21:56,066 --> 00:22:00,633
But we noticed your work from many other works,

238
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,966
and decided to add a spot for you.

239
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,800
That means when you sent me the notice,

240
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,950
you already decided to accept me?

241
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,533
Yes, we appreciate your work a lot.

242
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,400
It can be seen that you have a solid foundation in painting.

243
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,166
We also want to see you in person and listen to your design concept.

244
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,933
I can see that you are a person full of imagination

245
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,933
to be able to design such a piece of dreamy work.

246
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:29,800
Our school needs such bold students.

247
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,233
Prepare a visa and report to school in a week's time.

248
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,600
A-A week?

249
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,766
Any problems?

250
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:45,700
Examiners, can I report to school later?

251
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,366
The enrollment time cannot be changed.

252
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,533
Can I take online lessons?

253
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,866
Are you kidding me?

254
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,466
Yes, just kidding.

255
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,700
You are so humorous.

Didn't I say, I'll pick you up after you finish the exam?

259
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:29,233
I thought you'd pick me up at Xing Yue Airport.

260
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,100

Sorry, sorry. The plane was late, so I was delayed.

273
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,133
The plane was delayed. I'm late.

274
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,700
If I knew you'd ask me out, I would definitely not have gone to Beijing.

275
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,366
It turned out to be late. I'm really sorry.

276
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:24,533
What's wrong with you?

277
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,300
I made an appointment with you all of a sudden today. I don't blame you.

278
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,000
No matter when you ask me out, I should be by your side immediately.

279
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Why are you so nervous today?

280
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,433
Am I?

281
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:41,799
Actually… I don't know either.

282
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,866
Who I used to be… you knew it.

283
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:47,400
But after I met you,

284
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,766
I don't think I will.

285
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:52,933
Whatever I say and do becomes clumsy,

286
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,500
like a fool.

287
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,833
You are like a fool.

288
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,966
But I don't like the quirky ones.

289
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,366
I like fools.

290
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,116
What did you say?

291
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:11,733
You like fools?

292
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,433
Don't you like me?

293
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,666
She likes me! You like me?

294
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,599
Are you silly?

295
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,900
I'm really stupid.

296
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:45,100
So… kissing feels like this.

297
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,633
What did I do in the past?

298
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,633
I don't care about the past.

299
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,400
If you dare to mess around in the future, you are dead.

300
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,333
Why? You don't want me to control you?

301
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:03,400
No… The company asked me to take charge of the Japanese division.

302
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,800
I'm not afraid that you will control me. I'm afraid that you won't control me.

303
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,100
I am not going to Japan.

304
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:16,800
We haven't met in the past, but aren't we together now?

305
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,633
What's wrong? Are you afraid that we'll still be separated after being together?

306
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,488
Master, go to the restaurant.

307
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:52,221
Okay.

308
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:24,100
Do you think I look ugly today?

309
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,733
No, you look like a piglet.

310
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:35,599
How cute.

311
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,900
Aren't you worried about me getting fat?

312
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,666
Not worried.

313
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,366
You are already quite fat.

314
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,266
It's okay, I'll get fat with you.

315
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,000
You eat too.

316
00:27:57,766 --> 00:28:00,200
Your son's career is so cool.

317
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,066
He has liked this since young.

318
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:04,600
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

319
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:12,133
Do you know how they met?

320
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:13,266
I don't know.

321
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:17,200
It's because my daughter broke your son's aircraft.

322
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,450
Little Su actually threw my daughter into the mud pit.

323
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh my goodness.

324
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,766
The two of them are really quarrelsome lovers.

325
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:28,833
I see them both getting more and more compatible anyway.

326
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,900
They are a match made in heaven.

327
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh yes! Did you know they built a small house on Xing Yue Mountain?

328
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,311
Really? I didn't know.

329
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,000
Ah, I heard from Mia about it.

330
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,533
Mu Mu, based on De De's painting, built that small house.

331
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,966
Right, where's that painting?

332
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,466
This is the painting.

333
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,099
Have a look.

334
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,100
Ah, yes, yes, yes. I remember she painted this.

335
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,300
Right?

336
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,600
Unexpectedly, they even built a house!

337
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,766
The two of them built a house and lived together.

338
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,430
- No wonder…
- Mama Tian.

339
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,800
That…

340
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,633
I am very enlightened.

341
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,466
It's normal for children to be together.

342
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:27,933
I just hope they know how to protect themselves.

343
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,566
Ah, don't worry about this.

344
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:33,033
Our Mu Mu has been a responsible child since young.

345
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:35,700
I believe he will never do anything indiscriminately.

346
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,233
So is our De De.

347
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,133
She has been an opinionated child since young.

348
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:43,966
No matter what happens, she will be responsible.

349
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:46,400
Don't worry about this.

350
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:51,633
So, the two of them are really, really alike.

351
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:52,933
Yes, yes, yes.

352
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,820
Come and have coffee.

353
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,300
Okay, okay.

354
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,833
Come, come.

355
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,266
- We're home.
- Right.

356
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,244
Thank you for your hard work.

357
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:04,566
Mom. Aunt.

358
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:06,833
Why are you two back together?

359
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, Su Mu went to Beijing to pick me up.

360
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,233
You're not sensible at all.

361
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:14,400
Su Mu is already so busy and you let him go to Beijing to pick you up.

362
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,300
This is necessary. This is what boys should do.

363
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,833
How could you let your little girlfriend come back alone from such a far place?

364
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,100
Yes, the two of them are passionately in love.

365
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,150
Even if they get married in the future, you have to still be like this.

366
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,466
All right, Mom.

367
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,166
Tian Tiande has been tired the whole day.

368
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,966
Her stomach is a little uncomfortable.

369
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,016
So she came back first to rest.

370
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,400
Is your stomach better?

371
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:50,666
Yes… I walked and it digested, I feel better now.

372
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,166
You should eat less in the future.

373
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,100
Mom, let's go.

374
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,900
Ah, we'll leave first.

375
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,133
Oh! Okay, goodbye, goodbye.

376
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,333
Let's talk another day.

377
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,533
It's okay, we are going back.

378
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,766
We're leaving.

379
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,500
- Aunt, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Aunt.

380
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
- Bye-bye.
- Let's have tea together.

381
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,333
Okay, okay.

382
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,345
Stop watching. Let's go home.

383
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,633
You're back.

384
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,566
How was the exam?

385
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,900
Wow! Marvelous.

386
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:45,700
Sure enough, you didn't disappoint the expectations of a father.

387
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,100
Have a seat.

388
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,966
Look at your small mouth. Are you unhappy?

389
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,000
I've told you.

390
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,166
She is worried about being separated from Su Mu.

391
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,200
A long-distance relationship.

392
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:15,366
Girl, the most important thing in this life is to realize your dream.

393
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,500
Reflect one's own value.

394
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,533
But you can't live without love.

395
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:24,220
If you have sincere love for each other,

396
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,466
what is a long-distance relationship then?

397
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:29,833
Your dad is right.

398
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:32,133
Love and dreams are both important.

399
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:36,666
You can choose, and you can cope with both.

400
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,833
It's up to you.

401
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:45,300
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I will think about it.

402
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,566
Girl, don't be anxious about this.

403
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,200
Isn't it said here?

404
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,733
There are still a few days before reporting.

405
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,500
You can consider.

406
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,499
Your dad and I, again,

407
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:02,333
you've made your own decisions since young.

408
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:07,233
No matter what your decision is, you always have our support.

409
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,833
Thank you, Dad.

410
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,165
Thank you, Mom.

411
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:14,715
It's so good having you both.

412
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,500
Are we really going to be apart?

413
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:53,133
How am I going to spend these few years?

414
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,800
Why are you here?

415
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,700
Can't I come?

416
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,133
Of course, you can. You are welcome any time.

417
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:02,266
Just nice, have a drink with me.

418
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,233
Why are you here suddenly?

419
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:15,433
Is there anything important to announce?

420
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,466
Of course.

421
00:34:17,466 --> 00:34:20,120
I announce, I, Li Di,

422
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,166
formally joined Di Cheng Company today.

423
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,866
Wow, isn't that your dad's company?

424
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:29,100
What is there to announce?

425
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,466
Hey, this is different from what you think.

426
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:33,666
I didn't join as a young master.

427
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:37,000
I passed the interview and got in decently.

428
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,166
So, I, now have become Di Cheng Company's

429
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,750
outstanding intern.

430
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,166
Come, cheers for being an outstanding intern.

431
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,499
Hey. Don't look down on interns.

432
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:57,266
I believe that through my unremitting effort for a year,

433
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:01,833
I can be an excellent full-time employee.

434
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,766
I believe in you.

435
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,766
I see that you have been in a good mood recently.

436
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:18,033
If you have never experienced hurdles, how would you see the rainbow?

437
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,816
What hurdles have you gone through?

438
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,866
I…

439
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:28,633
From a boy… became a man.

440
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:31,500
You are in love, too?

441
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,733
What?

442
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:37,299
I just… figured out some things.

443
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:39,600
What's that?

444
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:48,700
Just some things I didn't understand before.

445
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Being so full of myself…

446
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,133
Just those things.

447
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:57,633
You now understand more and more.

448
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:01,266
I'm getting more and more confused.

449
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,916
What can you be confused about?

450
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,900
You and Su Mu quarreled?

451
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,766
No. Didn't I pass the interview?

452
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm going to study in the UK for a few years.

453
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,900
Isn't this a good thing?

454
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,133
It's a good thing.

455
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,033
But this means…

456
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,966
I have to be separated from Su Mu for a few years.

457
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:35,866
So you are worried about a long-distance relationship with Su Mu.

458
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,099
Yes.

459
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,666
It's okay.

460
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:47,833
People who will be together... will always be together.

461
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:52,016
People who won't be together,

462
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:55,883
even if they're together, will also be separated.

463
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:01,833
You really grew up, to be able to say such things.

464
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,833
Did I?

465
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,366
Yeah, just like us.

466
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:08,233
We will always be together.

467
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,766
Hey, do you still remember?

468
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:11,800
When we were in high school, once you came,

469
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,900
we became the best brothers.

470
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,033
We go to play and did various fun things together.

471
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,966
Went through everything.

472
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:22,700
In the end, we were still together in university.

473
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,633
This shows that we will always be together.

474
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,666
Right.

475
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,233
Thank you.

476
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:47,601
Enough. Don't you know your tolerance?

477
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,966
Stop drinking.

478
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,266
Yes.

479
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:54,273
You said it before, when it comes to drinking,

480
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,423
I'm just your little brother.

481
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,433
In my heart, you're always my good little brother.

482
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,833
So no matter what you go through, if you need my help,

483
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,200
just look for me.

484
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,066
I will definitely be the same as before.

485
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,333
I will stand up for you for everything.

486
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,983
Always standing up for you.

487
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:13,733
Yes, promise!

488
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,820
- Promise!
- Promise!

489
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,500
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

490
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,360
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

491
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,700
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

492
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,366
♫ Inadvertently ♫

493
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:43,000
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

494
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,960
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

495
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:56,700
♫ Can always protect you ♫

496
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,760
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

497
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,930
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

498
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,760
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

499
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:24,400
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

500
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,300
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

501
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:39,100
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

502
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:46,100
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
