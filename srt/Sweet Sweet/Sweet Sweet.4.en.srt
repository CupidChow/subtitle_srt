- Teach me how to make ice cream.
- He can talk?

24
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,866
But he came in the middle of the night

25
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,500
just to ask me to teach him how to make ice cream.

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,253
What does it all mean?

27
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,757
In order to repay all the money I owed him

28
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,810
I woke up early in the morning for the first time in my life

29
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,220
only to be greeted with, "The ice cream maker uses the back door."

30
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:13,240
But why do I start breathing funny

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,345
every time he gets near me?

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,120
Why do I keep digging myself in deeper?

33
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:35,000
Wow, the weather is really nice today.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,634
Let's go drawing!

35
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,533
What the hell! Again?

36
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,666
Su Mu! Is that your drone?

37
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,162
I'll smash it if it's not!

38
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,117
I'm not afraid of you!

39
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,609
You want to try me again?

40
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,629
Okay then, don't think I'm fooled.

41
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,933
Hey, you're taking creepshots. Right?

42
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,531
It's not my fault if you get smashed!

43
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:43,133
So now, you want my photo? I'll give you one.

44
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,116
Exposing my beauty isn't anything I'm afraid of.

45
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:47,616
Snap away.

46
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:07,747
When you can't fight it, then it's time to hide.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,321
You're cut.

48
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,237
Ah… it's fine.

49
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:34,363
What do you mean fine? Here.

50
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,780
All done.

51
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:49,505
It's just a small wound but you wrapped it.

52
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,153
Seems a bit much.

53
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:53,786
Better than nothing.

54
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,119
You helped me block the drone, I helped you wrap the wound.

55
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,885
We're even.

56
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,719
Is your machine okay?

57
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,397
It's fine.

58
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,819
Look, I'm confused.

59
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,693
Why is your drone always looking for me?

60
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,194
I and it don't get along.

61
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:29,870
Maybe it's my bad luck drawing it in.

62
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:32,453
It's a machine error.

63
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:36,896
Since the chip was lost, it keeps losing signal.

64
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,519
Hey, let me help you.

65
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,386
It was my fault.

66
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:57,419
I didn't expect it would crash into you.

67
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,186
It's me. I'm particularly unlucky since Mercury is in retrograde.

68
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,773
I'm out of luck for you.

69
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,160
You taught me how to make ice cream.

70
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,378
We're square now.

71
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,686
He's manipulated me so many times.

72
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:16,419
Why shouldn't I manipulate him once?

73
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,053
But how do you make ice cream if your hand is injured?

74
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:27,386
It's okay. Anyway, you don't have to eat ice cream every day.

75
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,919
I have to eat it every day.

76
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,216
Are you that girly?

77
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:40,853
In the past, I would drink ice water.

78
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,667
But eating your ice cream

79
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,871
has been far more efficacious.

80
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,395
It helps me focus on my calculations.

81
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,728
You're so weird.

82
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:57,053
Uh… I mean you are so good.

83
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,753
Very cute, very adorable.

84
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:15,606
In appreciation, I'll make you more ice cream.

85
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:19,219
- Put it in the fridge and eat slowly.
- No.

86
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,286
Once I start, I can't stop.

87
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,200
My body can't take it.

88
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,653
Then, what should I do?

89
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,591
You want me to make you ice cream every day?

90
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,150
Exactly.

91
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,392
Why does this feel premeditated?

92
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,226
Am I that boring?

93
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,018
You are.

94
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:44,186
Uh… No, no…

95
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:47,355
Come to my house at seven every night to make ice cream.

96
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:50,128
Why… at night?

97
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,919
Because you can't get up in the morning.

98
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,886
Oh… very considerate.

99
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:56,645
You're welcome.

100
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:05,886
Why do I feel that something is not right?

101
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:08,068
I promised him again.

102
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:17,686
Just like that, we reached a strange ice cream agreement.

103
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:21,217
These days, whenever the clock strikes seven

104
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,886
I go to his house

105
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,667
and make him ice cream.

106
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,001
Nothing more, nothing less, we never cross the line.

107
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,186
It's the mutual generation and mutual restraint Mu Mu mentioned.

108
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,419
Sometimes I think fate

109
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,242
might actually be wonderful.

110
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:47,886
I make ice cream for him.

111
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,853
It might seem quiet,

112
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,753
but there have been subtle changes.

113
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,219
He is smiling more and more,

114
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,772
and my luck seems to be getting better.

115
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:07,019
We always meet inadvertently on the top of the mountain.

116
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,053
I draw my castle in the sky.

117
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:13,086
He does his flight tests.

118
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:15,372
We don't disturb each other.

119
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:20,195
But I always feel that

120
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:23,653
the story between us will grow.

121
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:28,037
We are not two irrelevant parallel lines.

122
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,742
Yeah, great! I'll make you ice cream when we get back.

123

Thank you.

124
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,453
After eating Tian's ice cream,

125
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:03,117
doesn't your mind instantly clear, instantly refresh?

126
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,986
And then you can perform better.

127
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,706
Do you like painting houses?

128
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:15,119
Yes, I especially like Xingyue Mountain.

129

Such a good place, right?

130
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:21,995
If we could build a little house with green mountains at its back, facing the sea,

131
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,757
how great would that be!

132
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:27,751
Watch the sea during the day, watch the stars at night.

133
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,686
So cool to imagine, right?

134
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,407
Then, why don't you build one?

135

Are you joking?

136
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:39,019
You need the government's approval to build a house and money to build it.

137
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,065
I don't have money.

I'm holding it in my hands. The signboard fell off.

I'm afraid of the electricity, so I can't put it back.

Maybe I didn't install it properly.

166
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,251
Hey, there you are! I've been waiting for you.

167
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,951
- Where is he?
- Inside.

168
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:24,799
Hey, wait! I have to warn you.

169
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,155
It's Liu Tai, the son of Wan Xing's chairman.

170
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:31,671
- He just returned from overseas and—
- Why does that matter to me?

171
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,889
He's pretty troublesome, and wants to meet you.

172
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,001
So here I am.

173
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,011
Ah, that's true.

174
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,386
He's inside.

175
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:43,660
I can't talk to him anyway, so I'll leave you to it. Go ahead.

176
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,607
This is our chief engineer, Su Mu.

177
00:14:56,607 --> 00:15:00,760
This is our partner on the current project,

178
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,771
Director Liu Tai, from Wan Xing Holdings.

179
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,851
You're late, but it's okay.

180
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,633
Let's start.

181
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,225
Our latest design has incorporated a protective shield.

182
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:23,127
Performance against external interference has greatly improved.

183
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,680
At the same time, we also improved its photography capabilities.

184
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,250
It's capable of obtaining immediate real-time image data.

185
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,280
You don't have to explain it all.

186
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:33,499
If our company isn't capable of something, no one else is either.

187
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,486
Just tell me your completion date.

188
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:38,272
and I'll have them prepare to import the raw materials.

189
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,053
Do you know that some components need to be imported?

190
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,588
That requires advanced approval.

191
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,655
When I've completed it,

192
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,886
I will notify you.

193
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,509
All we ask is your cooperation.

194
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,460
What do you mean?

195
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,351
Su Mu's production cycle is very stable. Don't worry about that.

196
00:15:56,351 --> 00:16:00,104
Once we've got the plans finalized we'll give them to you immediately.

197
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,160
Okay, understood.

198
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,619
I'll go home and discuss it with my dad.

199
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:13,874
I have more meetings.

200
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,624
I'll leave first.

201
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,694
We won't see you out.

202
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:27,538
Congratulations, Sister De.

203
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:31,658
You two are moving so fast, almost like you used some magic spell.

204
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,984
It's only been a few days, but you already have that kind of relationship.

205
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,640
What kind of relationship?

206
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,789
Like, he rides on your bike

207
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,720
and helps you hang the signboard.

208
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,017
That's because I help him.

209
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:46,987
So it's normal for him to help me in return.

210
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,276
How do you help him?

211
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:51,051
- I help him to make ice cream.
- Oh…

212
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,435
That means you help him make ice cream and he helps you…

213
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:55,833
Hey!

214
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,045
Have you had better luck recently?

215
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,242
It does seem a lot better.

216
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:05,583
Doesn't it, though?

217
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:09,551
You have been leaving at 7:00 sharp the past few days… do you go and meet him?

218
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,276
Yes.

219
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:17,419
He asked me to go to his house every day to help him make ice cream.

220
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:23,139
Hey, but… How do you two communicate?

221
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:26,353
Did you learn more sign language?

222
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,664
We misunderstood him.

223
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,800
He can speak.

224
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,805
He's just quiet.

225
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,695
He can talk?

226
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,446
He is a weirdo.

227
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:41,150
But we have a pure business relationship. Don't think too much!

228
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,853
Hey, I'm not overthinking it.

229
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,019
I just want to see how he's changed your fortune.

230
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,201
Wow, look at this.

231
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,117
Your fortune is much more stable in your recent horoscope.

232
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,286
Look at this change.

233
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:55,934
Is this for real?

234
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,711
No way…

235
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,886
May 15th?

236
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,053
That was the day he repaired my scooter.

237
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:03,739
After that,

238
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:07,214
I did feel much less unlucky.

239
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,720
See! I told you!

240
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
As long as you don't mess with him,

241
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
you'll be able to survive retrograde Mercury.

242
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:25,460
No darling, I'm not lying. I didn't drive.

243
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,286
My mom is here, I'm shopping with her.

244
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,781
He is much better than some men.

245
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,745
Ah? Who?

246
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:37,517
There, that asshole.

247
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,703
Who is that?

248
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:48,319
I'd heard that Liu Tai is pretty difficult to deal with.

249
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,517
Cooperating with him this time, it's purely because we see Wan Xing's potential.

250
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:56,217
What he said just now, don't take it to heart.

251
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,248
I don't care.

252
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,701
That's good.

253
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,581
What's wrong with your hand?

254
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,614
I accidentally scratched it during the test.

255
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:07,035
Are you okay?

256
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:08,970
It's fine.

257
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,038
That's good.

258
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,017
All right, I'll bring you home.

259
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,411
You go pick up the car first. I'd like to buy some ice cream.

260
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,862
Okay.

261
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,860
It's fate.

262
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:34,717
De De, the signboard is already hung and there won't be any more customers. Let's close up.

263
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:38,087
Okay, then you go home and rest.

264
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,130
What? You're staying?

265
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,250
I'll stay and clean the shop.

266
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,531
What else is there to clean? I've cleaned it all.

267
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,376
You just want to wait for him.

268
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:56,232
No… Didn't I promise to make him ice cream every day?

269
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:57,719
And it's ready.

270
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,607
Yeah but… will he come at this hour?

271
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,220
Of course, we have a deal.

272
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,963
Okay then. Then I'll go first, you wait for him.

273
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:09,520
Okay.

274
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,814
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

275
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,636
You came.

276
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,798
It's been ready and waiting.

277
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,230
[Pink: Wait, Blue: Don't wait]

278
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:57,526
T-T-This is for you.

279
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:00,949
Thank you.

280
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,892
Then… I'll be on my way.

281
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:07,320
Then, are you not going home?

282
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,410
No, I am.

283
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,790
Get home safe. Be careful on your way back.

284
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,523
Okay.

285
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,500
Who is that?

286
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,773
Oh, hey, Li Di.

287
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:51,634
Where?

288
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:54,519
Oh okay, I'll head over.

289
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,619
Okay. All right, bye.

290
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,444
She'll be here soon. No one is allowed to tell her about my birthday tomorrow.

291
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,651
What? You just want to see if she remembers?

292
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:08,055
No way. I just want to surprise her.

293
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:11,940
- Shouldn't she surprise you on your birthday?
- That's true!

294
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,047
It's already a surprise if she remembers it.

295
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,886
You're nuts. Drink up, come on!

296
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,779
Cheers!

297
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,349
Nice hit! Well played!

298
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,119
Hey, what's up? Why didn't you react at all to such a nice hit?

299
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,382
Good shot! Yeah! Good shot!

300
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:46,345
What's the matter? You are not yourself recently.

301
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,802
Yes, Senior. You haven't been here for a long time.

302
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,384
What have you been busy with recently?

303
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:54,644
I haven't rested much lately, lots of late nights. So I'm just not feeling great.

304
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:56,717
It's not good to stay up. Your body can't take it.

305
00:22:56,719 --> 00:23:01,660
Yeah, what's so important that you have to stay up all night? Tell us about it.

306
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,328
- Watch dramas.
- Eh, watching dramas!

307
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:19,986
You have been in a good mood recently.

308
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,749
Yeah?

309
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:26,688
- Is it the ice cream?
- Yes.

310
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:30,619
But you can't eat it every day. It is bad for your health if you eat too much. Got it?

311
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,310
Got it.

312
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,414
Hey, do you have any plans for tomorrow night?

313
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,751
Nothing after 7:00.

314
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,253
- Hey, let's go play ball together.
- Yeah, cool.

315
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,726
Let's do that.

316
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:48,619
- Just playing ball?
- Yes.

317
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,159
- If not, what else?
- Yeah, what?

318
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,764
All right.

319
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,952
Oh, right! Let me ask you something.

320
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,342
- Ask away.
- Sure.

321
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:05,084
So… if you guys like a girl, do you come up with reasons to approach her, or...?

322
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,664
No way.

323
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:10,049
- No, it's actually very simple.
- Tomorrow is just about playing ball.

324
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,998
- Of course.
- Right!

325
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,982
Come on, let's drink!

326
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,886
Cheers!

327
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:21,586
Hey, why did you ask that?

328
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,554
I was just curious. I have been watching dramas.

329
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:27,226
It's for my reviews, just reviews.

330
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:30,062
Great, so we'll all meet up at the stadium tomorrow!

331
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:32,870
- Cheers!
- Tomorrow at 8:00!

332
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,310
Would you like something to drink?

333
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:39,081
No, thanks.

334
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,795
What are you doing?

335
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,812
- Making ice cream.
- By yourself?

336
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:56,135
I asked someone to do it for me.

337
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,624
A professional?

338
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,807
Yes.

339
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:01,984
But I think you should eat less.

340
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,231
I'm afraid that your body can't take it.

341
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,386
I asked her to make only one a day.

342
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:10,319
So I won't eat too much.

343
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,853
That's another solution.

344
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,260
But you still have to meet Hui Zi's friend.

345
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,484
I'm worried that this is just a temporary measure, and it'll get worse in the future.

346
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,953
I think it's getting better now.

347
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,486
Well, if you say so.

348
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:29,278
Oh, by the way, I'll stay here tonight. The people upstairs are renovating their unit.

349
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,466
Look at my dark circles. I haven't slept well for a few days.

350
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,453
It's your house, do whatever you want.

351
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,360
Isn't this also your house?

352
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,050
I'll go shower first.

353
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,113
Male or female?

354
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,511
Still not leaving at this hour?

355
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,970
They aren't living there, are they?

356
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,375
Let me wrap it with something else.

357
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,126
Why?

358
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:35,802
How can you use that on an injury?

359
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,651
I want to use this.

360
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:39,611
It's almost healed, anyway.

361
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:42,432
Why are you still bandaging it if it is healed?

362
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:46,586
Can you wrap it as it was?

363
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:52,186
Can't you just… work on your obsessive-compulsive tendencies?

364
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:56,089
Maybe it'll help reduce your stress.

365
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:58,824
Can you make the right bow bigger?

366
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:02,573
There you go.

367
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:20,660
- Daughter…
- Mom.

368
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,438
Are you at home alone?

369
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:24,307
Where's the plumber?

370
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,986
How can such a handsome plumber only come once?

371
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,351
Don't lie to me. Did he come by again?

372
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:34,619
Mom, what plumber?

373
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,686
Hey, Dad, my mom is drunk.

374
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:38,719
Your dad, where is your dad?

375
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:41,025
Your dad is over here!

376
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,229
It's okay, Mom. Hurry up and take care of my dad.

377
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,014
I need to go now.

378
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,525
How could you drink…

379
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,795
I'm hanging up now.

380
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:17,108
Why are you still up? What are you looking at?

381
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:18,556
Why aren't you in bed?

382
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:21,073
Hey, I haven't come back for a long time.

383
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:24,251
I'm not used to it. I can't sleep.

384
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:29,051
There's the toy dog under my bed. You can hug it and sleep.

385
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:30,486
Oh, right.

386
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:33,186
It's too late now. You should stop.

387
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:35,182
- Don't stay up too late.
- Got it.

388
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:37,786
Let's go, sleep now.

389
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,453
They even turned off the lights.

390
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:54,112
It's definitely a woman, right?

391
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,586
No, it can't be.

392
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:02,659
Su Mu wouldn't bring a girl home that easy, right?

393
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,553
Oh, maybe not.

394
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,146
I've also been to his house.

395
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:08,899
Wait, the hair band?

396
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,653
Is it the owner of the hair tie?

397
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:19,853
It's a woman!

398
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:25,508
I should stop thinking about it. It's not my business.

399
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:43,915
I'll definitely find out who you are!

400
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,386
I'll just wait you out here.

401
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,645
I'm not going to sleep.

402
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,178
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

403
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:12,029
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

404
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,246
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

405
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,395
♫ Inadvertently ♫

406
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:22,940
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

407
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:30,542
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

408
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:36,901
♫ I can always protect you ♫

409
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,481
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

410
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:48,486
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

411
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:55,765
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

412
00:30:58,043 --> 00:31:05,037
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

413
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:11,869
♫ That innocence and helplessness is given
to this evening breeze ♫

414
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:19,796
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

415
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:26,249
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
