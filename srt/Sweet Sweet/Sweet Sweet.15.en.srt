♫ I can't help ♫

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,200
I imagined watching the stars together.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,440
The final ending is that Su Mu really went to the planetarium.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,166
But the moment when he appeared in front of me riding a bicycle.

30
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,666
My heart still melted.

31
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:06,500
Compared to being with him, it's not important anymore.

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,173
We were so close on the bus.

33
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:11,900
I was so afraid that he heard my heartbeat.

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,066
Really not in love?

35
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,866
Mom's interrogation made me feel uncomfortable.

36
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,966
Not to the extent she has to follow me, right?

37
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:21,266
Where is she?

38
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:39,233
Where is she?

39
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,000
I blame God for ruining my plan.

40
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:54,100
Who else, if not him?

41
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,240
Taxi!

42
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,966
Sir, follow the car ahead.

43
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,269
Sir, stop.

44
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,268
Quick!

45
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,033
It's been a long time since I came to my alma-mater.

46
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,166
You park the car. I will wander around.

47
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,583
Sure.

48
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,233
Hey. Bye-bye.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,800
What's this situation? Hey!

50
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:52,499
Wow!

51
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,291
Hey, boss. What kind of fish is this?

52
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,333
This is the king of goldfish from Japan, Ranchu.

53
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,766
How much are these two fish?

54
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:04,666
- Not expensive, 700 yuan.
- 700 yuan?

55
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,507
No way, it's too expensive! 400 yuan.

56
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:09,333
Girl, this is daylight robbery.

57
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,128
Last price, 600 yuan.

58
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,133
Well, I don't want it then.

59
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,533
I'm leaving, leaving.

60
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,900
- Is this Ranchu?
- Yes, they are from Japan?

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,825
- How much are these fish?
- 700 yuan.

62
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,434
- Okay, I want them.
- Hey, sure.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,033
Aunt, you can't buy these fishes. They are not genuine.

64
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,633
Not really, I think they look good.

65
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:33,545
How can I lie to you? I would ask you to buy them if I were cheating you.

66
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,233
I'm not letting you buy them, how would I cheat you?

67
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,200
My family does the same business.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
Really?

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,788
Thank you.

70
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:42,466
Boss, I am sorry.

71
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,766
I do not want them already.

72
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,099
Thank you.

73
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
She doesn't want them.

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,960
Sell ​​them to me at a cheaper price.

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,601
- 400 yuan.
- No way, no way.

76
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:55,600
- Well.
- We both take one step back, 500 yuan.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,099
Sound okay?

78
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,100
All right! Take them, take them.

79
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,633
Thank you.

80
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,800
Where did he go?

81
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,366
Hey, little girl.

82
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:32,033
Didn't you say that these fish weren't genuine and shouldn't be bought?

83
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:35,333
He gave them to me for free.

84
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,066
I...

85
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,800
Hey, why are you only here now?

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,700
Come forward.

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,100
Why did you even bring two fish? Are they for me?

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,066
Not at all.

89
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,700
Do you remember the uncle who edited the video for us last time? Old Gao.

90
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,233
He helped us a lot.

91
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,809
So, this is a small gift for him.

92
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,400
- Oh... You are smart!
- Of course.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,127
- Ticket.
- Thank you!

94
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,278
Clayton will be coming here very soon!

95
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:11,711
Great.

96
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,145
Captain, the coach is looking for you.

97
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,241
What's the matter?

98
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,592
I don't know. Do you want to go and take a look?

99
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,109
Then I'll go over and take a look.

100
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,078
- You queue up first, I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

101
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,611
Bye-bye.

102
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,366
Su Mu.

103
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:46,133
Hi, it's really you! I thought I saw the wrong person.

104
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,500
Why are you here?

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,733
I sent my mom here.

106
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,287
Your mom?

107
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,333
My mother has a lecture here.

108
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,083
Why did you come? With two fishes in hand.

109
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,267
Oh. I thought these two fish were very similar to Old Gao's.

110
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:03,166
I think he would like them. So, I bought them.

111
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,566
Where is your mom?

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,133
Over there.

113
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,619
That's your mom?

114
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:16,866
What's wrong?

115
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,366
Run, hurry up!

116
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:24,878
- Professor Shu, you are here.
- Oh.

117
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,264
- This way please.
- All right.

118
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,262
Quick!

119
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,190
Why did you drag me and run?

120
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,091
I had some misunderstandings with your mom.

121
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,366
Aunt wanted to buy these fish.

122
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,233
I also wanted to buy these fish for Old Gao.

123
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,710
Then, I cheated her that these fish were not genuine.

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,966
It's okay, just explain to her clearly.

125
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,633
No, the first impression is very important.

126
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,183
It's all wrong,no matter how I explain now.

127
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,666
Everything can only fade with time.

128
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,066
Hey, what are you doing in school?

129
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,266
Well, Li Di got two tickets for the baseball star's signing session.

130
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,500
Then, I came with him.

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,880
- Okay.
- Let's go!

132
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,166
What's wrong again?

133
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,933
My mom is here.

134
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,766
Why are you hiding from your mom?

135
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,633
She saw us together again yesterday.

136
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,683
If she sees us together again today, she will misunderstand.

137
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,899
Misunderstand?

138

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,880
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

166
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,410
♫ Inadvertently ♫

167
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:11,260
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

168
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,460
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

169
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,100
♫ Can always protect you ♫

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,120
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

171
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,230
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

172
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:43,700
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

173
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,550
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

174
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:59,620
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

175
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:07,500
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

176
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,570
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫

177
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,250
♫ In the season, I got to know you ♫

178
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,000
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,990
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

180
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,060
♫ Inadvertently ♫

181
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,960
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

182
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,962
Where have you been? I have been looking for you.

183
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:51,161
Oh, I have something on, so I'm leaving now.

184
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,500
Why were you with him?

185
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,133
Oh, Su Mu's mother is coming to give a speech today.

186
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,269
He sent his mom here. We met coincidentally.

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,433
What did both of you do?

188
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,866
Hiding from my mother.

189
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:22,100
My mother thinks we are in love.

190
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,200
Oh... You two should be innocent, open, and aboveboard.

191
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,550
Aunt must have misunderstood you.

192
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,833
I don't see them at all.

193
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,533
This is weird.

194
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,466
I'm exhausted.

195
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,266
Aunt.

196
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,389
Why are you here?

197
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,280
I— I—

198
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,430
I'm here to do something, and I am going home now.

199
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,500
- Su Mu, this is...
- Oh.

200
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,600
This is our neighbor.

201
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,633
Aunt, this is my mother.

202
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:15,133
- Are you going back?
- Oh, yes.

204
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:17,739
Let's go back together, we can drop you off.

205
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,745
Ah, sure, sure.

206
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,545
Thank you.

207
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,800
Ah, please, please.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,264
Please, please get in.

209
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,817
Clayton! Clayton!

210
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:54,300
Yes, I finally got it!

211
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,948
- Thank you!
- No problem!

212
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:59,366
Do you have any plans later?

213
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,740
I can't accompany you anymore. I have something going on with the baseball team.

214
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,633
Okay. Get back to work. I'll find my mother.

215
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,273
Then I'll go first. Bye-bye!

216
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,647
Bye-bye! Wow!

217
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,536
I don't seem to have seen you before.

218
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:15,766
Ah! I usually live abroad.

219
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,566
I will only come back when I have matters.

220
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,800
Oh, that's right.

221
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,300
The children have grown up now.

222
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,933
Parents like us can't always follow them.

223
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,333
My son has been very independent since he was a child.

224
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,964
Independent?

225
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:32,064
It's good to be independent!

226
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,466
You are so handsome.

227
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:40,133
Have you found a girlfriend yet?

228
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,766
I heard him say that he seems to have found one, right?

229
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,700
Oh, really?

230
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,766
What kind of girlfriend is she?

231
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,900
This kid is embarrassed to say.

232
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,233
I haven't seen her.

233
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,866
But I heard him say that

234
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:57,116
she should be very pretty.

235
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,505
Pretty?

236
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay. And cute.

237
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,287
Being naughty? Does that mean cute?

238
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:10,600
Ah! She woke up early in the morning to make him breakfast.

239
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,566
Early in the morning?

240
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,534
Isn't that... Oh, that's not.

241
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,833
What is that?

242
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh, I said my daughter is not like this.

243
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,500
She sleeps until twelve noon every day.

244
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,533
Hey, wait.

245
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,100
I see.

246
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:52,166
Woke up early in the morning to make breakfast for others.

247
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,500
That's why I said, our daughter has separated from us.

248
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
She did not tell us when she fell in love.

249
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,833
Our daughter has grown up, give her some space.

250
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,979
She is back, stop saying. Gently, gently!

251
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,265
Dad, I'm back.

252
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,600
Our girl is back.

253
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,000
Where did you go?

254
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I went to the baseball star's signing session, didn't I tell you?

255
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,133
Mom, what's wrong with your legs?

256
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:23,366
Oh, your mother today had been running up and down the whole day.

257
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,251
I was jogging in our neighborhood for just a while.

258
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,837
- My legs are a bit painful now.
- Jogging.

259
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:33,933
Mom, how long have you not been jogging? Why did you suddenly think of jogging?

260
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,333
None of your business.

261
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,125
Hey, what are you doing with these two goldfish?

262
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,396
I bought them for my friend. I need to send them to him later.

263
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:46,033
Don't send them. Your dad and I have been having a bit of leg pain for the past two days.

264
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,633
You don't go anywhere.

265
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,033
Make us breakfast.

266
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,571
Go, continue your activities.

267
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,104
Yes.

268
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,880
Put it down.

269
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,766
Hey, De De. Um?

270
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,233
Massage for me, Mom.

271
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:18,531
- Oh, mother, I...
- Hurry up!

272
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,945
Sure.

273
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,883
Is it comfortable?

274
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,609
Mom. Um?

275
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,333
What's wrong with your skin lately?

276
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,901
It's all dried up!

277
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:44,986
Ah? There are wrinkles.

278
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,880
Wrinkles? Ah...

279
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,050
What to do then?

280
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,233
Ah. It's okay. I have a new mask that works very well.

281
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,787
- I'll get it for you.
- Okay.

282
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,000
- Hey, Old Tian!
- Um?

283
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
Why didn't you tell me about my skin!

284
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,233
You are always perfect in my heart.

285
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,619
What did you say?

286
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,933
What did you say?

287
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,966
Are you downstairs now?

288
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,433
Morning, let's go to the island.

289
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,900
Now? No way, I'm tied with something now.

290
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,666
I'll be going over later.

291
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,633
Okay, I'll wait for you at the harbor.

292
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,466
Okay, see you later.

293
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,933
Mom, this mask is amazing.

294
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,566
After putting it on, get some beauty sleep.

295
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:38,333
When you wake up, all your skin cells will be instantly awakened.

296
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,500
Relax.

297
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,700
(Don't worry. Go on your way.)

298
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,133
Thank you.

299
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,200
I was late, delayed by my mom.

301
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,300
It's okay, let's go.

302
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,966
Hey, aren't we going to look for Old Gao?

303
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,800
Why are you going to Bai Sha Island?

304
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,050
Oh, I went to the factory to find him yesterday. He was not there.

305
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,330
He lives on Bai Sha Island.

306
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,844
Then, are we going to take the boat?

307
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,033
Help!

308
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,480
Sir, drive slowly!

309
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,439
Help!

310
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,180
Help!

311
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,433
Help!

312
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:10,538
Help!

313
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,330
Are you all right?

314
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,683
I am okay, much better now.

315
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,700
Where is Old Gao?

316
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,966
I only know that he is on Bai Sha Island.

317
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:46,162
I don't know the exact location.

318
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,566
It's okay, let's find someone to ask.

319
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,200
Hello, Grandpa. Hello.

320
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,900
Do you know someone named Gao Bo?

321
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,833
Where is he?

322
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:03,966
Grandpa,

323
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm asking if you know someone named Gao Bo?

324
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Do you know where he is?

325
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
This grandpa seems to be unable to speak.

326
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,833
Same as you.

327
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,466
I mean, this island is not big.

328
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,166
We should be able to find him.

329
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,466
I'll look for him.

330
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,181
Thank you, Grandpa.

331
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,566
Wow!

332
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:06,300
♪ The stars in the sky don't speak ♪

333
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,789
♪ The doll on the ground misses mother ♪

334
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:10,833
Wow!

335
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,566
This place looks so good!

336
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,233
Wow!

337
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,700
The sea blends with the sky.

338
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,000
Su Mu, come here and look.

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,072
This is so beautiful.

340
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:22,875
Take a picture.

341
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,366
Let me take it for you.

342
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:28,044
Do you know how?

343
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:32,566
Here. Take a pretty one, okay.

344
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,666
Are you done?

345
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,475
Yes.

346
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,125
Let me have a look.

347
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,733
Hey! Jogging?

348
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,750
Yes.

349
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,060
I just want to ask you if there is any market nearby.

350
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,033
Yes, but it's quite far away.

351
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,866
It's better for your son to drive you there.

352
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:34,868
He's not at home, he's out.

353
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,091
Hey, you can jog there.

354
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:38,625
- You can exercise as well.
- That's okay, no need.

355
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,166
There will be a storm later.

356
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,700
Hey! Hurry up and put your clothes in.

357
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,178
Will there be a storm with it being such good weather?

358
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,374
Do you have rheumatism?

359
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:47,446
I don't have rheumatism.

360
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:49,156
Oh, I study this.

361
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,433
Oh, you study rheumatism?

362
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:52,833
Oh, anyway.

363
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,425
Anyway, hurry up and put away your clothes.

364
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,566
It's going to rain soon.

365
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh! Thank you!

366
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,566
Bye-bye!

367
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:02,697
People with rheumatism are quite accurate.

368
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:05,400
Let's get the clothes in.

369
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Hey, De De! Let me tell you.

370
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,766
Your mask is really good!

371
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:14,499
De De! De De!

372
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,258
De De!

373
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,333
Oh my goodness.

374
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,466
I can still sneeze on such a hot day.

375
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:28,133
Someone is thinking of me.

376
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:32,066
Hey, my damn charm!

377
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,433
Ah, I mean why is this island so big!

378
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:40,300
We have been looking for it, but still to no avail.

379
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,028
I feel like I have finished walking the entire island.

380
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,233
It's too early to finish it.

381
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,966
We only finished 1/3 of the distance.

382
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,001
How do you know that?

383
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,824
There are latitude and longitude lines on the map.

384
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:52,533
The different latitude is 111 kilometers.

385
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:53,700
Every degree difference,

386
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,900
correspondingly, 111 is multiplied by three--

387
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,175
What are you talking about?

388
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:01,166
I'm saying that at different latitudes, every one-degree difference

389
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,000
makes the actual distance not equal.

390
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,966
So we need to calculate--

391
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:09,433
I mean how can we find Old Gao?

392
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,033
I feel that he shouldn't live here.

393
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,700
Because the residents here said they have never seen him before.

394
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,466
Let's go over there and see.

395
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,233
There... How far is it?

396
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,800
About... an hour.

397
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,233
One hour?

398
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,566
I'm so thirsty!

399
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,200
Anyone?

400
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,633
Hi, anyone?

401
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,933
Is there anyone?

402
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,366
Take this.

403
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:03,166
So comfortable.

404
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,073
What are you doing?

405
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,873
Didn't you say it was comfortable?

406
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,466
Hey, you try it too.

407
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:16,995
Two yuan per bottle.

408
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:18,945
Three yuan for two bottles.

409
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:25,400
Hey, Aunt. Do you know where the old man with gray hair who loves to drink is?

410
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
They all love to drink.

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
They just bought a few bottles of beer from me.

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,400
There! There they are!

413
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:36,300
He seems to be Old Gao.

414
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,433
Let's go and see!

415
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,266
Thank you!

416
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:46,739
Old Gao!

417
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,237
What's wrong with you!

418
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,733
Hey! I find that every time I'm with you, I feel very unlucky.

419
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,333
Do you inhibit me?

420
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,325
Who asks you to act like a little crab?

421
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,200
Pat someone's shoulder without seeing clearly.

422
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,384
If I didn't take you away, you'd have been beaten.

423
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:16,300
You save me every time, is it because you like me?

424
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,850
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

425
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,617
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

426
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:35,177
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

427
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:37,333
♫ Inadvertently ♫

428
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:43,411
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

429
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:50,151
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

430
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,170
♫ Can always protect you ♫

431
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:04,203
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

432
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:08,301
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

433
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:16,142
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

434
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:24,644
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

435
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:31,683
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

436
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:39,517
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

437
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:46,414
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
