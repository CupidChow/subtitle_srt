Didn't you say I don't need to?

Oh, that's correct. You didn't say anything.

49
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:09,501
But didn't your demeanor suggest that I need not pay?

50
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,660
You can't compensate me with money.

No way… Working in such a big company, living in such a nice villa.

I actually meant… tomorrow morning at 7:00.

I couldn't go now anyway. I'm here to get my delivery order.

Who can get up at 7:00? Really, who?

76
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,850
Isn't he afraid of a stomach ache eating it that early?

I can't sleep either. Neither of us can sleep.

Could it be that knowing we'll meet tomorrow, he's too excited to sleep?

00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,255
The plumber.

168
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:00,366
The shower isn't working, right?

169
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:03,155
The plumber sure is handsome.

170
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:05,202
Is he?

171
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,200
Isn't he handsome? So handsome!

172
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,266
That's enough. Your eyes are popping out of your head.

173
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,942
Go about your vacation.

174
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,533
I have stuff to do, okay?

175
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,320
I don't have anything else to do.

176
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,733
I'd rather keep looking at your plumber.

177
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:08,366
It's not my plumber. It's everyone's plumber, okay?

178
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:11,431
Oh, right! Be safe now that you're home alone.

179
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,664
Don't let strangers come in, got it?

180
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,100
I know, Mom. I'm not a three-year-old kid anymore.

181
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,331
Wife, what are you doing?

182
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,564
Video-calling our daughter.

183
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,517
Here's Dad!

184
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:23,566
Let's go have dinner.

185
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:24,972
Okay, we're going to eat!

186
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:26,431
Goodbye, Daughter.

187
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:27,464
Take care.

188
00:22:27,464 --> 00:22:30,064
You both be careful, don't overdo it.

189
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:31,341
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

190
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,633
Bye-bye.

191
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,433
I've fixed the faucet for you.

192
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,456
Oh, okay.

193
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:06,933
- Then—
- Hurry up then.

194
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,033
Hey, wait a minute!

195
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,933
Can I wash up first?

196
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,431
Hurry up then.

197
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,378
Is he handsome?

198
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:24,001
He's pretty handsome.

199
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,244
But I'm not too bad myself.

200
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,244
Didn't you say you were washing up?

201
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,689
You also…

202
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,219
I know you're in a hurry so…

203
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,759
Fine.

204
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,036
You're quite serious about this.

205
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:03,283
I'll teach you well, so pay attention.

206
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,949
You may start.

207
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,564
I started ages ago.

208
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,931
I started from the moment I played the music.

209
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:25,300
Don't underestimate the power of music.

210
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,533
Tian's ice cream has soul.

211
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:31,523
This is an exclusive secret recipe.

212
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:34,523
Why didn't you play music the last time?

213
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,698
I did.

214
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,333
I played it in my heart.

215
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,564
I can hear it.

216
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,698
I was afraid you couldn't, so I'm playing it now.

217
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,590
Jot that down.

218
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,378
[PROCESS - 1. PLAY MUSIC]

219
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:57,360
Okay so, put in two eggs.

220
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,115
- [2. TWO EGGS]
- Separate the whites and yolks.

221
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,066
It's okay if you mess it up.

222
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,033
Just break the eggs again.

223
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:16,564
Next, the sugar.

224
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,033
How much sugar?

225
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:21,611
Put around two… no, one…

226
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:22,920
One or two tablespoons.

227
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,766
Oh, we go by feeling. Can't teach that.

228
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:27,917
Remember, by feeling.

229
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:32,066
- Then, put in whipped cream.
- [3. COARSE SUGAR - BY FEELING]

230
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:35,133
About 100 ml.

231
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,852
One hundred milliliters?

232
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,303
- [4. WHIPPED CREAM 100 ml]
- Then put 20 grams of mango.

233
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,233
Hey, wait a minute.

234
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,331
That's just a bite of whipped cream.

235
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,833
The mango is a single piece.

236
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,631
I used to think you couldn't speak.

237
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,900
Now, it's confirmed that you can't think.

238
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,623
If you want to eat more, you add more.

239
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:08,960
Then, stir.

240
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,020
- [5. ADD MANGOES. EAT MORE, PUT MORE]
- Keep going.

241
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,132
Stir, stir, stir.

242
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,133
Stir it well.

243
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,456
Thank you.

244
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,733
Oh.

245
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:17,900
I was afraid your hair would get in the ice cream.

246
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,533
Stir it yourself.

247
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:51,047
Ah, last time when I broke your drone…

248
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,366
Were you test flying on Xingyue Mountain?

249
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,214
Right.

250
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:59,935
When I used to practice painting there, why didn't I ever see you?

251
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,222
What's it got to do with ice cream?

252
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:07,307
How doesn't it?

253
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:11,366
Hey, why do you keep stirring? it's already fine.

254
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,788
Pour in two cups-worth.

255
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
Then put it inside.

256
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:25,528
It'll be done in twenty minutes.

257
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,252
You do it.

258
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,866
In that case,

259
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,494
are we even now?

260
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,994
Yeah, we're even.

261
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:11,780
I'm leaving.

262
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:24,566
I finally won one round.

263
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:28,975
Turned around dashingly without a hint of regret.

264
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:33,866
He was moved by my cute look.

265
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:40,111
Right, he did help me with my hair.

266
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,878
Hold on.

267
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:48,066
Why does he have a hair tie?

268
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,756
He's a man.

269
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:52,823
Why does he have a hair tie?

270
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,733
Could it be…

271
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,058
that he has a girlfriend?

272
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,945
Hey, Li Di. What's up?

273
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,631
Are you at home or in the shop?

274
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:09,505
Home.

275
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,698
What are you doing at home? Let's go play some baseball.

276
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,898
Ah, I'm not going.

277
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,398
I didn't sleep well last night. I have to make it up.

278
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,000
What did you do last night?

279
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:21,731
Washing, cooking, and watching dramas.

280
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,000
Playing on my own.

281
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,300
I'm going to go, I'm way too tired.

282
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,931
All right.

283
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:29,715
Uh, sleep well then.

284
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:30,740
Okay, bye.

285
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,286
Bye.

286
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,966
It's all because of you that I'm all tired out.

287
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,266
I can't do anything.

288
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:48,647
Forget it. I won a round anyway.

289
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:50,878
And my debt is squared away.

290
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:53,333
Strange.

291
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,984
Why can't I replicate the taste?

292
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,333
I knew it.

293
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,891
Only she can do it.

294
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,489
That's it.

295
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,381
- How are the calculations?
- Uh…

296
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:55,808
I don't mean to rush you.

297
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,464
I'll stick to my word.

298
00:33:58,464 --> 00:33:59,933
It's fine.

299
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,000
It can also be postponed.

300
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,800
No need, just a week.

301
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,666
Wow.

302
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,466
The weather is really nice today.

303
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:23,147
Let's go drawing.

♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
