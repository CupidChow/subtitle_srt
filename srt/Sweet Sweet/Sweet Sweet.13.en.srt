23
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,825
- Su Mu!
- Sister came to see him at the hut.

24
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,200
- Who is this Hui Zi we're hearing about?
- You always make her angry.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,233
- Seems like they've a good relationship.
- Is it?

26
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:01,969
- While eating…
- This is Li Di, my righteous buddy.

27
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:05,819
…Su Mu switched to the mugging little brother look mode again.

28
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,866
What is your relationship then?

29
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:12,566
But during the cycling race, he still knows to slow down and wait for me.

30
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,833
He made some progress.

31
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,600
I thought you can go fast?

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
I don't want to go fast.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,300
The question is, whether the progress is too fast?

34
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,433
Didn't I say I would be number one?

35
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,833
You are amazing!

36
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,766
Where are they?

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,737
There they are, slowly.

38
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,766
Am I stupid?

39
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,100
Captain is here.

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,250
We are already playing.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,800
Let me introduce you.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,466
This is Ding Xiaoyu, a new member of the baseball team.

43
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,067
- Hello.
- This is…

44
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,123
Hello, my name is Wang Yanyi.

45
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:17,373
I like watching girls playing baseball the most.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,680
Tian Tiande, our senior.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,300
She was part of the baseball team.

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,665
Hello, Senior. I've always heard about you in school.

49
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,433
- Hello, Xiaoyu.
- Hi.

50
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,766
This is…

51
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,500
a friend. Su Mu.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,800
Let's go play ball together.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,466
We're already playing.

54
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,980
Let's go.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,037
Let's go.

56
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,387
Come, let's continue to play.

57
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,277
Get ready, your right side.

58
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:54,766
Really, girls who play baseball are good-looking.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,133
Look! Youthful.

60
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,700
Blushing.

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,333
That's nice.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,655
- Let's go. The both of you, come play.
- I don't know how.

63
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,270
You're already here. It's not appropriate to just sit, right?

64
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,766
Get up and exercise.

65
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,166
Here, take this.

66
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,433
I'll teach you. Let's go.

67
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,616
Then, I'll teach you.

68
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:04,199
No need.

69
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,966
Just lift the left leg this way.

70
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,633
Lift your left leg.

71
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,966
Lift a little more.

72
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,366
Then twist it over--

73
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,933
Sorry. I lost my balance.

74
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,604
- Do it again.
- Okay.

75
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,766
Lift your left leg.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
Do you understand?

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,600
I still don't really understand. Please teach me again.

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,533
Actually, you have to raise it.

79
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,133
Correct, hold it straight.

80
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,533
Put your legs like this. Bend.

81
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,600
Stay focused.

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,366
When you release it, face downwards.

83
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,900
And move upwards in an arc.

84
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,550
Have you learned?

85
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,500
Your turn to try.

86
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:52,742
- Start now!
- Body generating strength.

87
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,766
Throw.

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,900
- Wow!
- Xiaoyu!
- Got it!

89
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,900
Great! Come, come!

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Awesome!

91
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,000
- Xiaoyu.
- I think you're quite talented like this.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
You taught badly just now.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,966
How about you go practice? I'll teach him.

94
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:14,500
Okay then, you teach him. Bye-bye.

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,409
I didn't want to learn well. What are you doing?

96
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,681
Hey, Xiaoyu! You teach me!

97
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:27,133
I'll stop playing. You guys go ahead.

98
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,333
- I'm also tired.
- Let's go and rest together.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,133
Zhou Zhou, wait.

100
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,566
Hey!

101
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:10,400
Are you and Li Di close?

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes, we are actually close to each other. We are too close to each other.

103
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,500
We were from the same school.

104
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
And I am one year older than him.

105
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,500
So… you both are on the same baseball team?

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
We pair very well.

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,600
We won the championship for our school for three consecutive years.

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,933
Apart from painting, what else do you like?

109
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,150
Apart from painting, I also like to play baseball too!

110
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,466
By the way, I also like riding motorcycles.

111
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,115
What about you?

112
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,800
What do you usually do?

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,366
Apart from making aircraft.

114
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,360
I know nothing.

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,133
Hey, I'm just asking… you…

116
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,300
What's with the mug face?

117
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,850
Hey, you can learn if you don't know.

118
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,192
- Old Gao.
- Old Gao.

119
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Where were you both? Only coming back now.

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
We went to play baseball.

121
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,366
What's wrong with you?

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My fish… are dead.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
Can't you just buy a few more?

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
These fish have a special meaning to me.

125
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,340
When my wife was sick,

126
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,300
I went to the hospital to take care of her.

127
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,766
I bought them at the bottom of the mountain from Hua Niao Market.

128
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:39,066
I bought the fish just to let her

129
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,700
get well soon.

130
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,966
Like these fish being free.

131
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,100
No longer tormented by illness.

132
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,266
I did not expect,

133
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,500
she still passed away not long after that.

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,200
I have been taking care of these two little guys ever since.

135
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:08,800
A few days ago, these two fish were not feeling well.

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,966
Xiao Lan died yesterday.

137
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:18,200
Today, Xiao Shou did not eat nor drink.

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
It also died.

139
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:26,230
You didn't come yesterday… was it because of this?

140
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,966
Fish are so affectionate.

141
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:38,200
If my partner knows they died, she will be upset.

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Old Gao, don't be sad.

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,866
They had your company, they must have been very happy.

144
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,000
That's why...

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,833
Be it husband and wife or couples, all must love each other.

146
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,333
Don't lose your temper.

147
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,600
Life is so short.

148
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Don't waste time quarreling.

149
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes. Seriously rebuke the urge to quarrel.

150
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Right. That's right.

151
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,566
I bought these fish at the bottom of the mountain.

152
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,566
Can I bury them here?

153
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,100
Yes, of course.

154
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,899
Good.

155
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,066
Hey, don't move.

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Hey. Old Gao, don't be sad. Come, I'll drink with you.

157
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,454
This is to honor Xiao Lan.

158
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,266
To Xiao Lan.

159
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,266
Xiao Lan…

160
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,892
Come, this is to honor Xiao Shou.

161
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:19,066
To Xiao Shou.

162
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,570
This cup is for great love.

163
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes, for love. Yes!

164
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,033
Stop drinking.

165
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,300
What?

166
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,900
You don't allow her to drink. Then, you drink with me.

167
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't drink.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,900
You don't know how to drink? Then we'll drink.

169
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,058
Stop showing the blueprints before my eyes.

170
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,333
I'm not in the mood today and I can't understand anything.

171
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,366
Let's talk about it in two days.

172
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,412
Let's ignore him. I'll drink with you.

173
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,833
Old Gao, we are very much alike.

174
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,673
You like fish and I like crabs.

175
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,267
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

176
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,330
Good.

177
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,361
Good.

178
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,466
Please come in.

179
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,599
Feel free.

180
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,666
Yo, your house doesn't look bad.

181
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,596
Of course. I'm not used to living with my parents so I made this by myself.

182
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,300
There are video games, too.

183
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,303
Let's have a match.

184
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,036
Sure!

185
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,800
Why do you look a little unhappy today?

186
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,733
No.

187
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,933
Stop pretending.

188
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,100
You can't hide it from anyone but me.

189
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,333
From my many years of experience in picking up girls,

190
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,333
you like your senior. Right?

191
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,766
No.

192
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:03,966
She and I are from the same high school and university.

193
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,683
And we are on the baseball team.

194
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,764
So the two of us have a good relationship.

195
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:10,233
It's okay if you don't admit it. I want to tell you.

196
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,233
You and Su Mu are my buddies.

197
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,600
You have to compete fairly for love.

198
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Go for it if you like her.

199
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,533
Men have to be brave.

200
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,966
How am I not brave?

201
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,266
One more thing.

202
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:27,300
I played baseball with you guys this time,

203
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,766
and I found that I really like this sport.

204
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,211
Bring me along next time.

205
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,400
Sure, I have training tomorrow. Let's go together.

206
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,858
Okay. Will Ding Xiaoyu be there?

207
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,633
Oh, Ding Xiaoyu has something tomorrow so she can't go.

208
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:46,333
Oh, I have something tomorrow as well. I have a meeting tomorrow.

209
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,100
What are you looking at? I have a meeting tomorrow.

210
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:02,166
Old Gao is really genuine.

211
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:09,433
Don't worry. Didn't Lao Gao ask you to find him in a few days?

212
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,533
Won't looking for him solve this problem?

213
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:15,066
So, don't worry.

214
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,500
I am worried about you.

215
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,933
Worried about me?

216
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,966
I'm not drunk.

217
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:33,366
When I find Old Gao, you accompany me.

218
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,366
Accompany you to find Old Gao?

219
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,300
Okay. But… you have to accompany me to watch the stars.

220
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,333
Stars?

221
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,700
Where do we watch them?

222
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,033
Go to a place where there are stars to watch.

223
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,133
Fool.

224
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,666
Okay, we will go tomorrow then.

225
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,533
Go tomorrow.

226
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,666
Fine, tomorrow.

227
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,300
Okay, go get busy with your work.

228
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,866
I'll sleep on this green couch for a while.

229
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,550
Go.

230
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,033
Don't look at me.

231
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,884
Don't bother me. Do your work.

232
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:50,199
Why don't… you go sleep in the bed?

233
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,433
- Hey, Mom.
- Su Mu.

234
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,738
My flight will reach there tomorrow at 11:00.

235
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,666
Pick me up. Don't forget.

236
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,833
Okay, I got it.

237
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,466
Why are you speaking so softly?

238
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,866
Nothing. I will pick you up tomorrow.

239
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,390
Okay.

240
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,666
Where am I?

241
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,066
Why am I in the bed?

242
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
This is so embarrassing.

243
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,133
Luckily.

244
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,366
G-G-Good morning.

245
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,766
I… I'm getting the hair tie.

246
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:16,366
How did I get in the bed last night?

247
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,666
I have no idea.

248
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,117
I only know you hugged my toy dog ​​to sleep yesterday.

249
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,600
Maybe I drank too much.

250
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,222
Ah no. I'm not drunk.

251
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,066
So I-I'm prone to dreaming.

252
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,466
I had a dream last night.

253
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,400
I dreamed of...

254
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,833
I forgot what I dreamed of…

255
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:03,266
I don't know why I slept in the bed anyway.

256
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't look at me like that.

257
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,666
I'm a very decent person.

258
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,592
Hey, what plan do you have today?

259
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:20,766
Going to the airport.

260
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,933
Oh, and then?

261
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,700
Nothing else.

262
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,633
Oh… okay.

263
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,200
S-S-Sorry.

264
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,366
This is moisturizing. Pat your face.

265
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,166
Oh… don't come out too late this afternoon.

266
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,833
Why?

267
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,233
Don't you want to watch the stars?

268
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Why are you here today?

269
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,100
Of course, I'm here.

270
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,566
Something is going on for you to dress up like this.

271
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,533
Ah… no.

272
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,266
Is it Su Mu?

273
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,166
Kissed?

274
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,800
No.

275
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,366
Held hands?

276
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,333
No.

277
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,833
Hugged?

278
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,714
No.

279
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,933
No again? Then, why are you two together?

280
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,933
We… are living together.

281
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:51,933
Living together already?

282
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,600
Ah, don't over-think.

283
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,000
We live together but sleep separately.

284
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,710
That… Who brought that up?

285
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,800
Of course, he brought it up.

286
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,466
Have you dated?

287
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,201
I don't think this is considered a date.

288
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:11,900
He just… invited me to watch the stars together.

289
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,966
Isn't this a date?

290
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,433
This…

291
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,366
Is it considered one? I don't think so.

292
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:20,490
Of course, it's considered a date!

293
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:23,966
Hey, are you dressing like this on a date?

294
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,700
What's wrong?

295
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,266
Isn't it pretty good?

296
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,833
It's not bad.

297
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,433
But let me tell you.

298
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:33,998
Your lucky color today is green.

299
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:36,065
You need more green color.

300
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:39,100
- Let's go!
- Where to?

301
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,400
Go shopping for clothes!

302
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,133
- How about our shop?
- Close the shop! There's no one.

303
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,800
This is called hunger marketing.

304
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,507
Okay, stop sending gifts.

305
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,166
This is the end of today's online class.

306
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,366
Bye.

307
00:24:56,366 --> 00:25:00,300
Mom, how did you become an internet celebrity from a meteorologist?

308
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,166
I'm stressing it to you again.

309
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:06,000
I am in a popular science call, okay?

310
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,966
Oh, by the way, this is from your father.

311
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,462
A gift for you two. Hold tight.

312
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:11,366
Where's my dad?

313
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:14,233
It's the same. Doing his work in his company.

314
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:17,400
Isn't that the same as my sister?

315
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,200
You can't be like your father.

316
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
You can't always sit in the office.

317
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
It's bad for your health.

318
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,233
I also run in the office.

319
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,466
Can that be the same?

320
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,066
You have to go and look at nature.

321
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,466
Go take a look at this beautiful scenery.

322
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:33,033
That's why I'm here to pick you up.

323
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,100
This time, I'm back for my speech tours.

324
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,738
I'll have to depend on you two.

325
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:41,038
You can trouble your son with this kind of matter from now on.

326
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,000
I don't care.

327
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,491
As long as one of the two of you is with me.

328
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,430
Hey, let's go directly to the Meteorological Bureau.

329
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,637
Mom, you just arrived. Won't it be too tiring for you?

330
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm not tired at all.

331
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I'm back home this time

332
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,000
to especially give a speech on the Aston Typhoon.

333
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Let me tell you. This typhoon is very peculiar.

334
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,433
The wind is also very strong.

335
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:02,333
You have to take note.

336
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,366
There will be a storm soon.

337
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:09,733
Mom, you talk to us about science anytime, anywhere.

338
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,991
Ah, right. How is your project?

339
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,291
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

340
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,766
You two are still the same.

341
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:23,977
Let's talk about it when we have dinner.

342
00:26:23,977 --> 00:26:26,077
- Something on later.
- Something on later.

343
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,432
Neither of you can escape from this.

344
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,233
- Which shop should we go to?
- That one.

345
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:38,200
What do you think?

346
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,433
Sure, go there first.

347
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,866
Let's go.

348
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,100
Let me have a look.

349
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,033
This one… This.

350
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,100
This one works too.

351
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,400
So many skirts?

352
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Hey, this.

353
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,366
Not nice.

354
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Hm… not pretty.

355
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,433
Hey, this is good.

356
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,133
Students, this typhoon has special characteristics.

357
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,883
Later when we go in, I'll tell you about it.

358
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:34,315
- What's the matter? You have something on?
- Nothing.

359
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,500
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

360
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,366
Let me tell you.

361
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,900
Don't you go anywhere today.

362
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,800
Mom just came back, you have to accompany her at least for dinner.

363
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,533
You accompany her. I have something on.

364
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,533
Didn't you just say, you don't have anything on?

365
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, I can't handle her alone.

366
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,757
Also, I called Hui Zi, too.

367
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:55,291
Come and have some food later.

368
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:17,133
If you are in a hurry, give him a call and ask him to come earlier.

369
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,166
It's okay.

370
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not the time yet. So I am not in a hurry.

371
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,412
He will contact me after he is done with his work.

372
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,666
Uh, see.

373
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,300
Your phone is ringing.

374
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,230
Hello?

375
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,851
Huh? Oh… see you soon.

376
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:43,889
The delivery boy is here. I need to go back to the shop.

377
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,121
- You need to go now?
- Um. I'll make a move first.

378
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:47,754
Bye-bye.

379
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,246
Mia!

380
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:22,933
Uh?

381
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,733
It's my first day back.

382
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:28,733
Can you put down what you are doing and accompany me?

383
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,266
I'm cross-checking with Hui Zi on the problems of the contract.

384
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:33,866
She will be here soon.

385
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:38,033
Hui Zi? I haven't seen that girl in years.

386
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:42,199
Su Mu, how are you two recently?

387
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,866
What do you mean? Nothing at all.

388
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,233
You're this old already, but still shy.

389
00:29:52,110 --> 00:30:03,220
[Su: I have something going on. I may be late.]

390
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:11,610
[It's okay. You are busy]

391
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,220
[I'll go there and wait for you.]

392
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,030
[Okay. I'll be there soon.]

393
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:20,600
Oh, yes! I heard there's something wrong with your exterior design. Has it been solved?

394
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,766
Hui Zi found an expert. His name is Gao Bo.

395
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:25,177
It's him.

396
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:26,733
You know him?

397
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,633
I heard that his reputation in the industry is quite…

398
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:32,933
What is it?

399
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,566
Quite weird. But this person is very talented.

400
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:45,066
I just scolded your sister.

401
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,700
Do you have anything on?

402
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,533
What else can he have?

403
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,133
It's your first day home. He dare not have anything on.

404
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,166
Let's eat.

405
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,897
I have something on.

406
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,066
I got to go.

407
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,966
The key is with you, send Mom back later.

408
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:02,400
- No.
- Hey.

409
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,166
No… Hui Zi will be here soon.

410
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,280
Hey, this boy!

411
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,330
Hey, Su Mu!

412
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,100
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

413
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,930
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

414
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,400
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

415
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,166
♫ Inadvertently ♫

416
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:40,730
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

417
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:47,230
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

418
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,660
♫ Can always protect you ♫

419
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,530
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

420
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,530
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

421
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,730
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

422
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:22,030
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

423
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:29,000
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

424
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,800
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

425
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,900
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
