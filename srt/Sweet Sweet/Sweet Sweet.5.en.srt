Su Mu's drone must have been subdued by my overwhelming beauty.

28
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,733
Since he defended me from injury,

29
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,228
I promised to make him ice cream every day.

30
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:08,266
And so now I eagerly await the arrival of 7:00 every night.

31
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,840
But then when I saw a mysterious car parked outside,

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,723
I suddenly found myself jealous. I'm thirsty!

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,583
Can a bottle of vinegar quench my thirst?

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,110
- Let's go early so we can have fun and do some shopping first.
- Happy?

35
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,333
I think you've been under too much pressure at work. You're losing weight, look at you.

36
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,666
I've always been skinny.

37
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,425
It was a woman!

38
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:03,495
Such nice weather today.

39
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,345
Are you going for a jog?

40
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,533
Look at him, smiling from ear to ear.

41
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,200
Behaves like an angry dog when he's with me

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,100
and turns into a puppy in front of another woman.

43
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:19,373
Gemini, he's got to be a Gemini.

44
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,120
Such a split personality.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,566
You know what?

46
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,100
You're like a kid.

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,678
Yo, head patting!

48
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:29,200
He lets just anyone touch him?

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,389
Let's get in the car.

50
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:36,010
Where are you going to have fun?

51
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,225
Why would he be with someone so average?

52
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,333
And here I have such great style.

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,525
She's not as cute as me.

54
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,039
What's this?

55
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:29,041
What? Here showing off?

56
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,800
Huh! It's them again!

57
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,975
I can take another road.

58
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:58,373
If I can't fight it, I'll hide from it.

59
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,103
Damn it!

60
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:23,085
I'm so unlucky!

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,170
Let's try their new menu items this evening!

62
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,655
- No, I have plans.
- You…

63
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,383
- Morning, Director.
- Good morning.

64
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:40,427
Good morning.

65
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,487

66

Morning.

67

Here you are.

68

De De, are you okay?

69
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,984
I am. The male lead of the drama died.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,351
- So it's over?
- Completely over.

71
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,015
Dead to me.

72
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,680
Hey! You… what happened?

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,500
Did you sleep in the bushes last night?

74
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:13,633
I accidentally fell asleep on the rooftop.

75
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,186
Why are you so careless?

76
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:22,940
Hey, Mu Mu… So, if a woman brings a man to his workplace,

77
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,096
what do you suppose their relationship is?

78
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:29,621
They might be colleagues or she's just giving him a ride.

79
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:33,333
Yeah, maybe it was just a free ride.

80
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,133
What if the woman lives in the man's house? Then what?

81
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:40,177
They must be a couple!

82
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:43,500
Yeah, why do I have to ask?

83
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:48,000
Still, you can't be certain.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,340
Perhaps it's… just that they're close friends.

85
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,613
Good reasoning, that!

86
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:58,083
Li Di and I used to go to school together every day.

87
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,373
W-W-What if that woman patted his head?

88
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:08,526
Don't worry, they're definitely not a couple.

89
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:11,593
I heard that kind of thing…

90
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:14,195
is just in the pre-couple infatuation period.

91
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:33,129
This person you're talking abo, it's not your Su Mu is it?

92
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,533
No way! Of course not! Never!

93

Hey, let me tell you… Those two have a really odd relationship.

105
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,940
Yeah, Xiao Cui said this morning in the underground garage,

106
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,833
she saw them arrive together.

107
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,633
Mi Ya even brought him to work personally.

108
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,533
I saw it a year ago.

109

Hey, going anywhere fun over the holiday?

111

What fun can I have?

112

- I haven't got a boyfriend.
- Still single.

113

In the future, don't make your own ice cream.

114
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:53,000
This is ice cream from over at Xie's. It's very similar to what we had in Austria.

115

If you like it, I can have them send it to you every day.

You don't like it?

117

It's okay, I've sent some others to the house for you to try.

What's wrong?

122

You couldn't sleep with me there?

123
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,329
You slept with my pillow yesterday.

You should have told me, I'd have let you have it.

By the way, you really can't go to dinner?

I'd rather not.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Should I go… make ice cream for him?

128
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,066
Go?

129

Oh, so you're one of the old timers, then.

I wouldn't go that far.

137
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,168
- Su Mu and Wang Yanyi are the old timers.
- I can't compare with them.

138
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:42,635
No wonder they have such a good relationship with Mi Ya.

Why would we? We didn't.

♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

327
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:07,248
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

328
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:12,216
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

329
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,693
♫ Inadvertently ♫

330
00:30:13,693 --> 00:30:19,052
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

331
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:25,627
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

332
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:31,580
♫ I can always protect you ♫

333
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,248
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

334
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:43,967
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

335
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:50,879
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

336
00:30:53,378 --> 00:31:00,373
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

337
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:07,329
♫ That innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

338
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:15,187
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

339
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:21,365
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
