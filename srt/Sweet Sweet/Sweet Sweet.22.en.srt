27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,300
Maybe it's telepathy. Master, to the airport.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,100
To the airport.

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,800
In order to surprise each other,

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,240
we came to each other's city without prior plans

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,130
but perfectly missed each other.

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,960
The place he stayed in Beijing, I feel his presence everywhere

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,260
and I miss him even more.

34
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,740
When I got the news,

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,640
our school requires us to report ourselves in a week,

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
The joy of a successful interview

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,440
was immediately replaced by the sorrow

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
of having to part ways with Su Mu.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,840
For all this time, he has given me a lot of surprises and affection.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,340
The things that I want to tell him,

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,920
I don't even know, where I should start.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,780
Right.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,420
Senior.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,740
Enough.

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,800
Don't you know your tolerance?

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,160
Stop drinking.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,520
Yes.

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,540
You said it before, when it comes to drinking,

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,290
I'm just your little brother.

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,680
In my heart, you're always my good little brother.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,300
So no matter what you go through, if you need my help,

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,400
just look for me.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,140
I will definitely be the same as before.

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,500
I will stand up for you for everything.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,550
Always standing up for you.

56
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,920
Yes, promise!

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
- Promise!
- Promise!

58
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,220
Hey, what made you want to join our baseball team?

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,040
I think it's pretty cool. So I joined it.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,560
You're not afraid of the ball smashing onto your face?

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,060
I think the ball would have been more afraid of me.

Say it. What's on your mind?

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,940
Uh… N-N-Nothing.

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,100
Nothing?

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,860
You asked me out this late for a walk?

83
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,160
Ever since I've known you,

84
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,500
you seem to be able to hear what's in my heart.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,940
Can't hear you.

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,840
Do you know mind-reading or something?

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,640
Then tell me, what am I thinking right now?

88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,380
Hmm… Something about the exam?

89
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,960
See, I told you! You're a mind reader!

90
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,720
Not really.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,680
When I last saw you in Beijing, I knew something had been bothering you.

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,780
So what's up? I thought you aced it.

93
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,760
Exactly because I aced it. That's why…

94
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,040
If I'm going to study abroad, I'll have to part ways with you.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,880
But I don't want to be away from you.

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Then stay.

97
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,220
I-I thought you would talk me out of it.

98
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,320
Silly, I don't want to be separated from you either.

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,270
Now, why would I talk you out of it?

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,180
That makes sense.

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,120
Ah. Have you really not dated before?

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
Nope.

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,020
Then, how are you so good at it and I'm not?

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,520
That's because you're stupid.

105
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
You're the stupid one.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm smart!

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,920
- Smart?

108
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,440
If you were so smart, then you wouldn't have to study abroad.

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
Bite me.

110
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,200
If I'm going to study abroad, I have to be separated from you.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,200
But I don't want to be separated from you.

112
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,400
Where are you heading off to?

113
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,560
I was going to find you.

114
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,480
Are… you coming to my house so early,

115
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,120
because you were eager to see me?

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,240
I wanted to ask you out for a date.

117
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,780
But… not now. It's going to be at night.

118
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,960
At night?

119
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Yes. Because I've to work during the day.

120
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,800
At night. I'll bring you to watch the stars.

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,900
Watch the stars?

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,660
It's the stars in the sky. Not the gorilla.

123
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,040
Where did you learn that from? Do it again!

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,800
I haven't seen enough.

125
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,720
No more.

126
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,560
Fine.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
Hey! What are you doing?

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,980
You're making a crime scene.

129
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom, have you seen my swimsuit?

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
You're going to the beach?

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Yeah. I have a date with Su Mu at the beach.

132
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,260
Your swimsuit…

133
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,960
One was a kid's swimsuit I got for your elementary school.

134
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,420
The other one is a fully-covered one-piece swimsuit.

135
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,680
If you're gonna wear it,

136
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,380
Su Mu is going to think that you're messing with him.

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,860
You are a grown up.

138
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,500
You should wear… a bikini!

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,120
Bikini?

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
Hey, here are the swimsuits.

141
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,180
Go on, pick one.

142
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,620
Uh… T-T-This one then.

143
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,740
This one? This won't do.

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
This one. This one looks good.

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,460
Mom… T-T-This material... makes it no different than going nude!

146
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,180
Let's get something more conservative.

147
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,940
Conservative? How about I get you a diving suit?

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,980
- Great.
- No, we're getting this one!

149
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,180
Attendant, wrap this up!

150
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,760
You are going to look great wearing this! Definitely!

151
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,850
Don't think so… Eh?

152
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,560
Li Juan?

153
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,220
Tian Bingbing?

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,640
De De, this is mom's university classmate. Aunt Li.

155
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,340
Nice to meet you, Aunt.

156
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,900
Li Juan,

157
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,020
we haven't met for a few years, why did you become like this?

158
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,140
I have divorced.

159
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,780
When did it happen?

160
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,300
Weren't you doing great with your husband?

161
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,740
You just can't trust romance.

162
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,840
He will fall for young and pretty girls at first sight.

163
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,200
All these years, he had cheated on me several times.

164
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
My goodness… How could that be?

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,780
I remember he treated you very well.

166
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,860
Do you remember during our university reunion?

167
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,000
We used to praise him,

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,060
praised that your husband was handsome and talented,

169
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,480
and how nice he treated you.

170
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,580
My goodness… T-That means it's all changed now?

171
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,220
Back then, I gave up my career to take care of this family.

172
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,640
During our divorce, you know what he said?

173
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,280
He said that I don't work!

174
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,700
Free-loading off of him at home!

175
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,060
You see? Women should have their own career!

176
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,520
Back then, I was working in my shop.

177
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,180
Look, the business was small, but it was stable!

178
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,260
Right, I was out of options.

179
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,780
The things I learned at school were all forgotten,

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,400
and I still need to take care of my kids.

181
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,060
I can only do whatever to make ends meet.

182
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,900
Look! It was your own choice back then.

183
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,470
Who says it wasn't?

184
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,420
Back then you all were admiring me, and now it's the other way around.

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,340
What is there to admire about us?

186
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,180
Every family has their own difficulties.

187
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,000
At least your husband loves you, and you have a wonderful daughter.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,580
She seems pretty smart,

189
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,600
and she definitely has a bright future ahead of her.

190
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,580
Thank you, Aunt.

191
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh, right! Do you remember our university years?

192
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,960
Xiao Hua from our class? How is she?

193
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,560
She married her husband and went overseas.

194
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,540
But who would have known,

195
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,840
her husband went bankrupt after a few years of work.

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,120
She's not doing too well now, bringing up two kids.

197
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,180
Hello.

198
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,820
Hello. What time are we going to the beach?

199
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm sorry. I got a lot of work right now.

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,540
- Oh.
- Maybe a bit later.

201
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, then you go on ahead.

202
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,920
Just wait for me at home first.

203
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,453
Oh, okay.

204
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,440
Hello, Li Di?

205
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,680
What are you doing?

206
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,180
Nothing to do.

207
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm just slacking off, looking for you to chat.

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,400
Then, what are you doing? In the office?

209
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,820
Yes. I'll be in the office every morning.

210
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,140
So how are you?

211
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,500
It's all right. I'm a bit tired though, but it's very enriching.

212
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,260
I guess it's fine once you get used to it.

213
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,920
Yup, it's not bad.

214
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,100
I feel like I know too little,

215
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,460
there's plenty to learn.

216
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,400
That's what you get for not studying properly.

217
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,920
Fooling around every day.

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,780
I regret it.

219
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Oh, that's right! What about your overseas study?

220
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,600
I haven't figured it out yet.

221
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
If I had your chance, I would definitely go!

222
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Unfortunately, I don't.

223
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,350
Oh, my dad's here! That's all for now. I need to go back to work.

224
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,620
I'll find you for a ball game some other time. Bye-bye…

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,040
Hey, I…

226
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,100
Why did he hang up so fast?

227
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,640
Now everybody's so busy and being enriched and I'm just so idle.

228
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,500
I won't end up like that old lady, will I?

229
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,000
You said you will bring me out to watch the stars.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
But there are none in the sky.

231
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,360
Tonight… There will be shooting stars.

232
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,340
Shooting stars? Wow, then I can make a wish!

233
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,900
Let's get our phones ready to take some pictures.

234
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,940
What are you smiling about?

235
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,690
You get ready too. You can take pictures if I miss them.

236
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,380
Right.

237
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,180
When I was young, I would always daze by the beach.

238
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,280
Mom always asked me why.

239
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,440
And I said that I wanted to know what's on the other side of the ocean.

240
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,980
Mom said that I would know when I grew up.

241
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,500
Slowly, I have truly grown up.

242
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,740
And I have truly seen the outside world.

243
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,660
It is indeed mesmerizing.

244
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,400
But… I always think about going home.

245
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,540
♪ The outside world is wonderful ♪

246
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,240
♪ The outside world is helpless ♪

247
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,560

I know everything.

268

Ah, shooting stars! L-Let's take a picture!

269
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000

♫ ...are given to this evening breeze ♫

That's right,

277
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,600
that's how sudden shooting stars are.

278
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,950
I-I was talking about you.

- Doing calligraphy, Dad?
- Yeah.

285
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,440
- You're finally back.
- Yeah.

286
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,060
My girl is home.

287
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,620
So, how was it? The swimsuit was great, right?

288
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,720
Mom, Su Mu didn't even let me take off my jacket.

289
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,360
Huh? Why?

290
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,840
I-I don't know either, go ask Dad.

291
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,780
Why?

292
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,580
Why? The weather was too cold I guess.

293
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,660
Was it cold?

294
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,000
No I can't, he still has to work after our date.

295
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,420
I can't disrupt him.

296
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,070
[Little Brother: I'm done. Let's go to the beach.]
[I can't wait anymore.]

297
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,070
[Little Brother: Where are you? I'll pick you up.]
[I'm in your heart.]
[Little Brother: 😊]

298
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,100
Where's S-Su Mu?

299
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,260
Did you sneak out again?

300
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't wait for him anymore.

301
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,250
He… W-What happened to him?

302
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,200
He's… having a meeting.

303
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,740
He told me to send you off. Don't wait for him anymore.

304
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,960
There's no need.

305
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I can go home on my own.

306
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,080
Cheer up.

307
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Get used to it, it's going to be your new normal.

308
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,060
You're both lucky.

309
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,610
At least you can see each other in the same place.

310
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,840
Unlike myself, I have to go to Japan soon.

311
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,540
- Going to Japan?
- Yes.

312
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,280
Our company has a joint venture with Shen Hai,

313
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,880
they will send me to the new branch.

314
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,230
Then, what are you going to do with Ding Xiaoyu?

315
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,660
What can we do?

316
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,120
We go our own ways.

317
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Can't you not go?

318
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,720
I don't want to go either!

319
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,060
But Xiaoyu also supports me.

320
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,180
I figured it out.

321
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,900
Men have to venture out, I can't be compared to girls.

322
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
What's wrong with us girls?

323
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,360
You see, Su Mu's career is successful. Right?

324
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,420
You just need to stay at home, give birth to a couple of kids,

325
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,640
and do some house chores.

326
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,880
When he's back, just give him some hugs and kisses.

327
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,200
Wouldn't that be great?

328
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,320
W-Who told you that?

329
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,240
I said it myself.

330
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
Male chauvinist.

331
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,640
Come here, dear.

332
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,940
Let's eat, shall we?

333
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Leave it alone, please.

334
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,000
Y-You're back, honey?

335
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
What are you doing?

336
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Why is our house a mess?

337
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,940
You can't even discipline our kids?

338
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,820
- I…
- Go make dinner!

339
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,520
All right.

340
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,500
I said whatever should be said.

341
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,000
How is she?

342
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,840
Before I said it, she was quite panicked.

343
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,360
After I said it, she was even more panicked.

344
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,500
Didn't I tell you not to upset her?

345
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,540
She was just panicking, not upset.

346
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,180
Panicked?

347
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,740
- Oh my.
- I'm so tired.

348
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,780
What a busy day, so tired.

349
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Have a seat.

350
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Hey, dear girl, what were you thinking the whole day?

351
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,800
Are you missing Su Mu? Go find him then. It's so near.

352
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,420
It's useless even if I find him. He's so busy.

353
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,120
I think he's done now, right?

354
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,240
I figured it out.

355
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,900
I have decided… to study abroad.

356
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,360
Are you all right? Why would you want to study abroad?

357
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,040
That's right. You had a fight with little Su Su?

358
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,240
No. I wanted to go, but I'm still feeling indecisive.

359
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,300
The better Su Mu treats me, the more I can't let go.

360
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,720
At the same time,

361
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,780
the better he treats me, the more I should trust him.

362
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,440
Distance and time, can't change our feelings.

363
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
Unless... he changes.

364
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,420
Besides, I don't only love Su Mu. I also love myself.

365
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,800
I love my dreams...

366
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
and my future life.

367
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,520
Dear daughter, you have grown up.

368
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,450
Dear girl, do you remember what I told you here,

369
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,060
when you failed the test the last time?

370
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,420
My dear girl would never fail me.

371
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,080
Ever since you were young, you always knew

372
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,740
what to do and what not to do.

373
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,780
Whatever you did, you would've done it excellently.

374
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,700
Just this point, you made your dad very proud.

375
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,500
I thought when you started dating, you would lose yourself.

376
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,720
I didn't expect this relationship, has made you grown up.

377
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,280
Like the idiom, you can't catch the sand through the hourglass.

378
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,140
And you can't get back the youth you've lost.

379
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah, you're almost like an idol to me now.

380
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,960
Hey, don't say that. I'm embarrassed.

381
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey, then when do you plan to leave?

382
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,800
The reporting date is the day after tomorrow.

383
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,100
- Then you have to leave tomorrow.
- Why?

384
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,020
You need to start packing.

385
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,640
What if… you missed something?

386
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Your dad is right.

387
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,660
Hey, if you got to leave tomorrow, have you told Su Mu about this?

388
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,620
I have only decided on a whim.

389
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,080
When I think about leaving tomorrow, I just can't… let go.

390
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,220
Dear girl, how about this?

391
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,940
Go make a phone call to Su Mu later, inform him,

392
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,280
and let him get ready to send you off tomorrow.

393
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,980
Hello, Su Mu.

394
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,080
I… have decided to study abroad.

395
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,020
I-I will leave tomorrow.

396
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,940
Right, that's fine.

397
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
Okay.

398
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
B-Bye-bye.

399
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,080
H-He doesn't have the time tomorrow.

400
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,340
Hey, Su Mu, this bastard.

401
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,820
Dear girl, do you want to think it over?

402
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,640
I'm not going to.

403
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,040
I have already made up my mind.

404
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,200
That's my girl.

405
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,880
Right. Since you have made up your mind, that's final.

406
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,900
All right, we're all exhausted. Pack up, let's go home!

407
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,540
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

408
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,400
Sister Mia, why did you ask me out today?

409
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,640
I've got something important to tell you.

410
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,240
What's that?

411
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
I like you.

412
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,340
Did I hear it wrongly?

413
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,000
I. LIKE. YOU.

414
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,680
Oh. I know you're afraid of me splitting up both Su Mu and Tian Tian.

415
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,640
But I told you before, I'm not that childish.

416
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,220
That's their problem, and this is about me.

417
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,280
Ever since we met in the bar, I can't forget you.

418
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,380
Y-You… Are both you siblings always this honest?

419
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,040
Yes.

420
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,700
I want to win.

421
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,560
So I'm not afraid of losing.

422
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,180
But Sister Mia, y-you know that I always see you as a big sister.

423
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,020
That's fine, you can continue seeing me as a big sister.

424
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,980
But... I will see you as a boyfriend

425
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,640
until the day you no longer see me as a big sister.

426
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:40,320
Or… a big sister-like… girlfriend.

427
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,400
But Tian Tiande also sees me as a younger brother.

428
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,020
Why didn't I say it like that?

429
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,240
That's because you don't have the guts.

430
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
It's clear that you don't like her enough.

431
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,100
But me… I like you enough.

432
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,780
But, Sister Mia, we haven't known each other long enough.

433
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,640
How could you possibly like me?

434
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,140
Then Su Mu and Tian Tiande, haven't seen each other for long either,

435
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,320
yet they still ended up together. Right?

436
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,940
Liking someone isn't accumulated through time but through feelings.

437
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,440
Feelings?

438
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,400
Just be honest. Do you have feelings for me?

439
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:24,520
I feel like… a little bit… confused.

440
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,120
Little Wang, I think you're being too courteous.

441
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,060
We can catch our ride.

442
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,440
There's no need to purposely send us off.

443
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,620
Su Mu doesn't have the time.

444
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,860
He specifically told me to send you to the airport.

445
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,280
I have to say, he set his priorities straight.

446
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Work is more important.

447
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,580
As for sending her off…

448
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,640
♪ Send you to outside of the village ♪

449
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,340
♪ I got a word with you ♪

450
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,280
Why did you all bring me here?

451
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,980
Anyone?

452
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,360
Li Di. Sister Mia. Why are you here?

453
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,260
Li Di, I'm talking to you.

454
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,600
Xiaoyu, you're here too?

455
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,560
Wang Yanyi, what's going on?

456
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,460
Aunt. Sister Huizi.

457
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,210
Dad. Mom.

458
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,980
Why are you all ignoring me?

459
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,500
A-Am I dreaming?

460
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,500
Mu Mu, do you know where Su Mu is?

461
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,280
Why are you all not talking?

462
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,700
And ignoring me?

463
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,240
Little Crab.

464
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,940
This is not a dream.

465
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,340
I will always… be with you.

466
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,560
Uncle. Aunt.

467
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Tian Tian may be giving up on studying abroad.

468
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,800
We know about this.

469
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,360
She has been like this ever since she was young, she has her own thoughts.

470
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,360
I also respect her choice.

471
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,400
But… I don't want her to give up her dreams because of me.

472
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,900
Little Su, what are you thinking?

473
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,780
Please trust me, Uncle and Aunt.

474
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,260
I won't disappoint you all.

475
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,400
But… I need your help.

476
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,600
- Help?
- Help?

477
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,780
Professional indeed. You got the role spot on!

478
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,020
Hey, how about me? How was my acting?

479
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,720
You? Need more practice.

480
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,620
Oh, fine then.

481
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,900
I have to leave. Thanks.

482
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,240
If I had this chance, I would definitely go.

483
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,220
Unfortunately back then, I missed it.

484
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,420
Okay, I have to go to work now.

485
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,580
When I have the time, let's go for a ball game.

486
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,520
Hey, look at me that day. I was miserable.

487
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,220
It was your fault.

488
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,220
Look at this one.

489
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,720
Very silly, I look like a piglet.

490
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,340
Hey. During the shooting stars that night, did you make a wish?

491
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,290
What kind of wish did you make?

492
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,700
My wish… is fulfilled.

493
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,560
♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, my darling ♫

494
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,100
♫ I can go away slowly when I think of you ♫

495
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,000
♫ Little torturous pixie ♫

496
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,840
♫ How can you be so sweet? ♫

497
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,660
♫ This long journey, step by step ♫

498
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,020
♫ Put you in the pocket, along the way ♫

499
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,960
♫ Your chest is warm and soft ♫

500
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
♫ It's you in the heart ♫

501
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,220
♫ I can't help smiling when I think of you ♫

502
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,340
♫ The scenery outside the window, change after change ♫

503
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,580
♫ Happy memories, scene after scene ♫

504
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,160
♫ When you're so deep in love, you'd praise anything ♫

505
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,680
♫ Even a cold breeze feels nice ♫

512
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,500
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

513
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,360
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

514
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,830
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

515
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,590
♫ Inadvertently ♫

516
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:36,060
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

517
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:42,360
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

518
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,700
♫ Can always protect you ♫

519
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,760
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

520
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,960
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

521
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,800
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

522
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:17,360
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

523
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:24,400
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

524
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:32,200
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

525
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,600
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
