♫ I can't help ♫

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm so stupid.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,100
- Su Mu looked panicked when he found me.
- Tian Tiande!

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,133
He hugged me tightly.

30
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,975
He likes me, right?

31
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,987
His carefulness while bandaging for me.

32
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,500
The gentleness while blow drying my hair.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,366
I feel like I can't leave him anymore.

34
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,833
The rain outside is getting heavier.

35
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,166
But... does it matter?

36
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,666
After the rain, it's sunny again.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,633
Actually…

38
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:39,100
I want to tell you…

39
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,500
I like you.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
Good morning.

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,533
Good morning.

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,100
I'll get up first.

43
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,400
You are up?

44
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,033
The scenery here is really good.

45
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,100
Very comfortable.

46
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,731
Did you sleep well yesterday?

47
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:38,933
Slept well.

48
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,433
Maybe because I was too tired.

49
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,058
I don't know what time I fell asleep.

50
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,433
Last night…

51
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,430
did you hear anything?

52
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,666
I heard it.

53
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,900
I heard the thunder!

54
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,233
It scared me!

55
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,166
Did you hear… other voices?

56
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,000
No… I didn't hear anything.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,466
Did you hear others?

58
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,466
It was nothing.

59
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,333
Does your leg still hurt?

60
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,495
It doesn't hurt anymore, it's pretty good now.

61
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,433
I can even do a leg press.

62
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, right! Did you see Old Gao?

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,133
Old Gao? I really didn't see him when I woke up this morning.

64
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,200
Okay, let's pack up and go back.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Okay.

66
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,833
Give me your hand.

67
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,866
Feeling better?

68
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,486
Hey, Sister!

69
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:35,166
Why do you only come back now?

70
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,786
I went to Bai Sha Island last night.

71
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,817
There was no boat to come back due to the storm.

72
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,066
Why didn't you tell me before you went to see Old Gao?

73
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,566
Your phone couldn't be reached either.

74
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:46,166
There is no signal on Bai Sha Island.

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,396
You two went together?

76
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,817
Yes.

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,366
Ah, let me introduce you. This is Hui Zi.

78
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,466
She is a good friend of Su Mu's and mine.

79
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,966
She is Tian Tiande.

80
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,660
She is the little sister who lives opposite us.

81
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:08,800
Ah, hello.

82
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,342
I heard of your before.

83
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,669
Oh, really?

84
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,122
Uncle and Aunt, why is she not back yet?

85
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,633
Oh, wait for a few moments more.

86
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,466
Shall we call the police?

87
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:26,833
What police?

88
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,400
Stay calm.

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey, isn't she back?

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,633
What happened? You're back so late.

91
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,309
I went out to have fun with my friend.

92
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:38,500
Where did you go?

93
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,866
Bai Sha Island.

94
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,233
Then, why couldn't I call you?

95
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,633
Don't you know there is no signal on Bai Sha Island?

96
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,300
Okay. Hey, right.

97
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,833
Hey, what happened to your leg?

98
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,229
Ah, I accidentally cut it while playing at the beach.

99
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,033
What did you do? Sit.

100
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:59,034
Well. You make a good match with your dad this time.

101
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,433
You deserve it!

102
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,233
I have asked you to not go around.

103
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,833
Talk to her nicely since she is back.

104
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,521
Does she listen if I speak nicely?

105
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,833
Why not, Mom?

106
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,443
When did I not listen to what you say?

107
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:12,566
I listen to you the most.

108
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,700
Stop it.

109
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:19,200
Li Di, send her to the second floor quickly.

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,633
And see if there are any problems.

111
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,766
Ah, sure. Brother,

112
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,800
let's go. I will check for you.

113
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,833
You!

114
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,366
Our girl is back.

115
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,066
Why are you still so angry?

116
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,433
You spoil her!

117
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,833
Hey, you are being unreasonable.

118
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,900
When did I spoil her?

119
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,633
Haven't I been spoiling you all the time?

120
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,186
Hey, enough. Go away.

121
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,233
I am pissed off!

122
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,200
Enough. Don't be angry.

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,433
Don't, don't.

124
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,866
Are you okay? Is it serious?

125
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,311
Oh, it's okay! It was a small cut.

126
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,033
Sit here.

127
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,533
This doesn't work, I'll bandage it up for you again.

128
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,773
Hey, no need. It has been treated.

129
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,233
The wrapping is so messy.

130
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,133
What doctor is that?

131
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:10,200
Not a doctor, Su Mu bandaged for me.

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,166
Su Mu?

133
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,463
You went there with Su Mu?

134
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,966
Why did you go with him?

135
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,966
Do you remember the uncle who edited the video for us?

136
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,666
He is a partner of Su Mu.

137
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,033
We went there for a vacation

138
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,500
and help him to negotiate a partnership.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,833
What does his partnership have to do with you?

140
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,633
Doesn't he like me?

141
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,400
Who likes you?

142
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,733
The uncle, if not, who else?

143
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,800
Hey, why did you help Su Mu?

144
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:47,966
Neighbors, it's nothing.

145
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,900
It was a small matter.

146
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,466
Are you-u-u?

147
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,966
Why are you being womanish like my mom?

148
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,400
Womanish?

149
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,966
Don't I care about you?

150
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,410
The calls did not get through.

151
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,408
Okay. Isn't there no signal on Bai Sha Island?

152
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,666
Hey, hand me the yellow one.

153
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,800
Thanks! Why were you looking for me?

154
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,569
I looked for you…

155
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:19,973
- We just got Clayton's autographed ticket yesterday.
- Yeah..

156
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:22,966
He will come to our city later for another exhibition match.

157
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:27,200
- His ticket can only be exchanged with our signed ticket.
- Really?

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,708
Wow!

159
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,861
Where is your signed ticket?

160
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,253
Where is your signed ticket?

161
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:36,807
My signed ticket? I'll look for it.

162
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:40,200
Look for me quickly! Hey, if you lost it, I can't forgive you.

163
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
- I'm sure I didn't lose it.
- Be careful.

164
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,127
Let me look… I remember…

165
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,885
Let me look for it.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,650
What did Old Gao say?

167
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:58,100
Oh. Old Gao went through the blueprints and thinks that our idea is quite good.

168
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,266
But he made a few comments. If we can correct it,

169
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,371
there should be no problem with a cooperation.

170
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,300
Like I said, Old Gao will definitely appreciate your talent.

171
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,933
Thanks to you this time. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to find Old Gao.

172
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:15,326
I just happened to know that he was on Bai Sha Island. But I didn't know where he was exactly.

173
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,366
How did you find him?

174
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,233
We… walked through almost the entire Bai Sha Island.

175
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,300
Finally, we found him.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,508
Hey, you two stop the discussion.

177
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:32,215
Discuss it later when we go to the company in the afternoon.

178
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:34,316
Hurry up, go out and have some fun.

179
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:42,213
Bo Bo hasn't come to your place for a long time. He is excited.

180
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,366
Bo Bo, come.

181
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,900
Fortunately, you didn't lose my signed ticket.

182
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,766
If not...

183
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,033
How could I lose it?

184
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,200
Then, I'll grab the tickets later.

185
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,671
If I get it, let's go together.

186
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:06,017
Sure! Hey, our Clayton!

187
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,881
Hey, you have changed your outfit. Where are you going later?

188
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,283
I am asking you.

189
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,533
I'm going to the ice cream shop later.

190
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,304
Why do you still want to go with your injured leg?

191
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,100
Hey, if it wasn't for my mom nagging me, did you think I wanted to go?

192
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,067
Then I'll take you there.

193
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,300
Oh, isn't that Ms. Hui Zi?

194
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,466
Why? Do you know her?

195
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:36,466
Not really. I met her outside the swimming stadium yesterday.

196
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:46,037
It feels like they are close to each other.

197
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,721
I heard from Brother Yi that his sister Mia seems to want to match-make them.

198
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,633
Match-make?

199
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,333
How can match-making be better than natural development?

200
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,914
What natural development?

201
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:03,200
- Ah, nothing. Would you still send me to the ice cream shop?
- Of course.

202
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,003
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

203
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you feeling better now?

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,366
I am okay, much better now.

205
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,975
- Be careful.
- Okay.

206
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,133
What's wrong?

207
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,500
Ah, it's okay. Let's go.

208
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,734
- We are leaving.
- Okay.

209
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,000
Is my mother's cooking delicious?

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,266
Aunt's cooking is definitely delicious.

211
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:09,900
Yeah, I haven't eaten meals cooked by her for a long time.

212
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:18,140
- Su Mu, is that the ice cream shop you said? The one that is very delicious.
- Yeah.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,657
Great, let's just buy one and try.

214
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:24,680
- Then, I'll go back to the company first, I am not going with you.
- Okay.

215
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,366
Let's go.

216
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:32,829
Here you go.

217
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,663
Which is the most delicious today?

218
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:35,793
All of them are delicious.

219
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:38,466
- Which is the most delicious?
- This is the most delicious one.

220
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,106
The chocolate one?

221
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,162
Hi.

222
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:43,272
You…

223
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,366
Oh, Sister Hui Zi.

224
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:48,333
Hey, aren't you Wang Yanyi's buddy? Li Di?

225
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,564
Yes, you still remember me!

226
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,764
Hey, you are here!

227
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:04,431
She made it for you a long time ago, wait.

228
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,766
Your ice cream.

229
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,717
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

230
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,053
What do you want to eat?

231
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,566
Old rules, separate into half.

232
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,900
- Can you give me a spoon?
- Okay.

233
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,124
- What about, you…
- Thank you.

234
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:44,900
Let's go.

235
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,228
Remember to use this.

236
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,333
Hey, Wang Chengfeng.

237
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,000
Play ball?

238
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,733
Forget it today.

239
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,533
Go. Go and play ball.

240
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,300
Isn't your foot still hurt?

241
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,466
Don't I have the medicine?

242
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,911
Okay, we will be there soon.

243
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
Let's go!

244
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,933
Come, take it!

245
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,833
Coming!

246
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,100
Take it!

247
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,089
Come!

248
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,690
Sure!

249
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,640
[Medical Alcohol Cotton Balls]

250
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
Come again! Be more precise!

251
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,433
Old rules, separate into half.

252
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,433
Brother Li, let me try again!

253
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,700
Senior, we'll leave first.

254
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,182
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

255
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,895
Harder!

256
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:37,883
Okay!

257
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,509
- Let's ask sister De De to eat something.
- De De, let's go! Let's eat something.

258
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,610
Sure.

259
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,250
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

260
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,700
Eat this, Brother Li.

261
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:29,035
- Senior.
- Yeah?

262
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:31,359
Are you very tired today?

263
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,766
Uh, no. I am fine.

264
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,666
Sister, what major did you study in school?

265
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,200
I studied interior design. I'm one year higher than Li Di,

266
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,384
but we joined the baseball team in the same year,

267
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,935
I used to listen to Brother Li complimenting you.

268
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:46,200
There are not many girls in the baseball circle.

269
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,766
As one of the few female players in our school,

270
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,691
you must carry forward my spirit.

271
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:53,400
Fight for three consecutive championships with your Brother Di.

272
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,366
I can't guarantee three consecutive wins. I just like playing baseball.

273
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:57,600
But I don't play very well.

274
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,533
As long as you are in the team, Wang Chengfeng and the others will play extremely hard.

275
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,766
So, your role is to boost the spirit.

276
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,966
Hey, why did I notice when I was on the team, why couldn't I boost your spirit?

277
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:11,833
Who said that? I was very spirited!

278
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,133
Hm, sure! Thank you, Junior!

279
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,027
- Come. Come.
- Xiao Yu!

280
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,366
- Hey!
- Where are you?

281
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,566
- We are drinking outside.
- With whom?

282
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,066
Me, Tian Tiande and Ding Xiaoyu.

283
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,782
- Ah? And Ding Xiaoyu?
- Yeah.

284
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:34,533
Wait for me, I'll be there soon!

285
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,782
Same place, we will wait for you.

286
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,967
Who's that, Brother Di?

287
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,633
Brother Yi, Wang Yanyi. He will be here soon.

288
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,733
Brother Yi…

289
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,066
Ah, enough. That's all for technical issues discussions.

290
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,900
This is the company's basic strategic deployment. Have a look.

291
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,766
If all goes well, they'll set up a division in Japan.

292
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,366
At that time, you and Su Mu will be in charge of it.

293
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:07,000
Sure, no problem.

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,833
Xiaoyu!

295
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,166
You are here, too? What a coincidence!

296
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,566
You are?

297
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,700
You don't remember me?

298
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,700
It's okay if you don't remember me.

299
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,900
Let me tell you.

300
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,933
We played baseball together.

301
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,966
Do you still remember?

302
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,066
Oh, it's you! I am sorry.

303
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,700
How could you say sorry?

304
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,166
It's my problem,

305
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,166
I didn't show up around you often.

306
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,273
I punish myself for a cup.

307
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,467
You are here, too!

308
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:51,089
- You are here!
- You two, stop quarreling!

309
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,900
Let's drink!

310
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,700
Come, bottom's up!

311
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,666
Don't drink too much.

312
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,900
You too. Drink less.

313
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,058
Brother Yi, why are you looking for me at this late hour?

314
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,233
What else can I have?

315
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,133
Su Mu and Hui Zi are doing academic research in the company.

316
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:29,233
I have nothing to do. So I sneaked out.

317
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,633
To drink with you.

318
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,333
Brother Yi, you are not in the meeting

319
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,840
and still wandering outside.

320
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,266
What do you do in the company?

321
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,966
Financial director.

322
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:46,493
That is… the one

323
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,633
who manages money.

324
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,233
I'm going to the washroom.

325
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,334
I'll go with you, Senior.

326
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,700
Brother Yi, you are being too obvious.

327
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,978
Was I?

328
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:04,748
I'm afraid she doesn't know.

329
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:06,926
You don't understand, right?

330
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,066
If you like someone, you must tell her.

331
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,566
If you hide it, no one knows you like her.

332
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,551
Aren't you afraid that she will reject you?

333
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:16,000
Then you must know why.

334
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,566
How could she know if you don't tell her?

335
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,466
Buddy, this time it's different.

336
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,617
Ding Xiaoyu is different from other girls.

337
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:25,433
She makes me want to settle down.

338
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:27,233
I think my previous days are wasted.

339
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:30,200
I really like Ding Xiaoyu this time.

340
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,333
I want to confess to Ding Xiaoyu.

341
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Su Mu.

342
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,666
Okay.

343
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,733
Where's Wang Yanyi?

344
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,466
Xiaoyu, what do you usually like to do?

345
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:57,833
I usually like to play baseball.

346
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,833
No other activities?

347
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,573
I also like to go out to have fun.

348
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:07,233
Camping! Do you want to go camping?

349
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,441
I…

350
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:12,270
- Forget it, I'm too tired.
- Do you want to go?

351
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,033
Why not? Everyone can relax.

352
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:17,266
- Of course!
- I will go as well.

353
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,700
Sure, let's go camping. 12:00 tomorrow.

354
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,506
I have to answer a call.

355
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
Hello.

356
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,700
Ah, I'm answering a call downstairs.

357
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,300
I'll come back right now! I'll come back right now!

358
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,860
I… 12:00 tomorrow, it's a deal!

359
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,600
We have a deal!

360
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,700
Wait for me!

361
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,633
I am back. What happened?

362
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,059
- Where did you go?
- I was downstairs.

363
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,464
My brain hurts when you discuss technical issues.

364
00:23:57,464 --> 00:24:00,600
About the Japanese company, it's better for you to explain.

365
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,300
We have a Japanese client who is keen on our technology.

366
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,598
They want to establish itself in the Japanese market.

367
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:07,865
The specific situation is like this.

368
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,666
Why are you still here?

369
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,599
What are you thinking?

370
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,233
Nothing.

371
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,415
Do you want to go camping tomorrow?

372
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,666
I have no time.

373
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,400
No, I have asked Li Di and Tian Tiande.

374
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,800
And my little girlfriend.

375
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,566
Not going.

376
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:38,766
Why is he still the same?

377
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,600
I just met your girlfriend, Yang Hui.

378
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,633
Why are you here?

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,903
Drop me a message on WeChat.

380
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,500
Young people nowadays,

381
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,166
they become philanderers when they have some money.

382
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,548
Not as reliable as your dad.

383
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,015
Thank you for the compliment, Wifey.

384
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:06,500
Be sure to keep your eyes open when you find a boyfriend.

385
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,400
A person like this, you cannot choose them.

386
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,533
Not choosing. Not choosing.

387
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:15,466
Wifey, don't overturn a boat with one shot.

388
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:19,133
I think Li Di is a very good kid.

389
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,166
Ah, he is a good kid.

390
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:23,200
Li Di?

391
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,900
Mom and dad, I have to go camping with Li Di tomorrow.

392
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,633
I'll pack first.

393
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,333
You go then.

394
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,129
Hey, don't forget to bring the mosquito repellent.

395
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,451
Hey, Wifey.

396
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,966
Li Di and our girl have been together since high school.

397
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:50,066
Do you think they are more suitable?

398
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,966
I don't feel so.

399
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:54,233
Why?

400
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,900
Didn't I say?

401
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,033
Feeling.

402
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,933
Feeling, okay.

403
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,133
Hi, De De.

404
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,028
You must wear long-sleeved shirt and pants tomorrow.

405
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,541
Hey, you have to bring mosquito repellent even if you wear long-sleeved clothes.

406
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,252
- Okay.
- And sunscreen.

407
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,226
Since we are going camping tomorrow, don't put on heavy makeup, there's nowhere to remove it.

408
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,400
The most important thing is that you have to rest early.

409
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,159
You must have a good night's sleep.

410
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,666
Bye-bye.

411
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,700
Where are they?

412
00:26:58,266 --> 00:26:59,766
Coming.

413
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,133
Everybody's here. Let's get into the car.

414
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,700
Wait! There is one more person.

415
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,433
Who?

416
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
Isn't he coming?

417
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,700
Everyone's here now. Get in the car.

418
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,900
Come on, let's start our camping trip.

419
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,333
Why are you all so dull? Get high!

420
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,266
We lack music.

421
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:56,333
This time it works!

422
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:06,766
The place I found is in the mountain and sheltered from the wind.

423
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:09,366
It's by the sea, super scenic.

424
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:13,033
With the tent set up and a barbecue.

425
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:15,066
Cozy!

426
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,800
How is it, Xiaoyu?

427
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,366
Xiaoyu?

428
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,200
Ah, what?

429
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,330
Nothing, nothing.

430
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,223
- I was asking you if you are thirsty, do you want to drink water?
- No. Thank you.

431
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:32,500
Tell me if you are thirsty.

432
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,166
- I have water here.
- Thank you.

433
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,329
Have one too, De De.

434
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,033
Thank you.

435
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,400
Ah, let me tell you. He has always been narcissistic.

436
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,300
In the past, he spent half an hour grooming his hair before going to the stadium.

437
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,766
It's so greasy.

438
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,033
As a result, after the game finished, he was like being licked by a donkey.

439
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:01,033
There were all guys at the stadium. I don't know who he wanted to show off to.

440
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,500
Who said they were all male?

441
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,100
- Weren't you there?
- I've seen you too much.

442
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,733
Do you need to do this? He made Wang Chengfeng stare at his hair non-stop.

443
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,008
He failed to catch the ball and it went straight to him.

444
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:12,866
Two of them looked at each other affectionately.

445
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,733
That scene…

446
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,333
Really?

447
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:20,366
No, it's not. Wang Chengfeng was not coming for my hair.

448
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:25,600
Why did you lower the window?

449
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,005
It's hot.

450
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:29,371
Okay, let me turn on the air conditioner.

451
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:34,800
Their teammate was a sore loser.

452
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,700
So I…

453
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:41,541
Didn't I turn on the air conditioner? Why did you lower the window again?

454
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,666
To see the scenery.

455
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,246
He's a sore loser, so he asked Wang Chengfeng to deliberately break the rules.

456
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,200
Isn't the wind too strong?

457
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,666
No.

458
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,966
Hey, let me take it for you.

459
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,426
- I will take it for you.
- No need.

460
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,022
No worries.

461
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,716
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

462
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,700
Wow, it looks good.

463
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,638
Wow!

464
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,166
Of course, how could the place I choose be bad?

465
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,066
Hey, the scenery is really good!

466
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,376
- Sister De De, let's take pictures.
- Sure.

467
00:31:07,376 --> 00:31:10,682
- Me too!
- Take a picture. Take a picture!

468
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,534
Su Mu, come here to take pictures together!

469
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:16,566
No, you guys go ahead.

470
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:18,300
It's okay, we'll go ahead.

471
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,751
Three, two, one, say cheese!

472
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,166
It's not working.

473
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,000
What's wrong?

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,716
Hey, it's fine. Let Su Mu take a picture for us.

475
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:29,800
He doesn't know how to take pictures.

476
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,233
The pictures he took for me were blurry.
I can't keep any of them.

477
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,733
It's true.

478
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,195
Who said I don't know how to take pictures?

479
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,633
Smile.

480
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,133
Hold.

481
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:18,956
- Can you hurry up? My face is numb!
- Almost there.

482
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,841
Is it so complicated to take a photo?

483
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,833
Done.

484
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,733
Let me have a look.

485
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,300
Come, have a look.

486
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,800
Su Mu, what did you do? Su Mu!

487
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Let me see.

488
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,479
I told you he doesn't know how to take pictures.

489
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:38,266
- But you didn't believe me!
- Hey, where's Li Di?

490
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,370
- Hurry up, take it again.
- Let me hold it.

491
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:45,900
Let's take a photo with everyone.

492
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,300
Three. Two. One

493
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,312
Say cheese!

494
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,833
Look at this!

495
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,966
The place that I chose, isn't it amazing?

496
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,533
It's good.

497
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:12,900
Later, we'll set up the tent and the grill.

498
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,233
Looking up at the stars in the sky.

499
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,600
Looking down at the dolphins in the sea.

500
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,800
Eating barbecue and drinking beer. Cozy.

501
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,333
But there is nothing here. Where is the tent?

502
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,875
I've already prepared the tent.

503
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,621
Wait for me.

504
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,709
Xiaoyu, come here and take pictures.

505
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,981
Sure.

506
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,300
- One, two.
- Be careful. Don't fall.

507
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,433
Hey, have you prepared it?

508
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,733
Yes, it was done a long time ago.

509
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:47,433
That beef, mutton, and mutton leg.

510
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,741
I'm not saying these. I meant my fireworks!

511
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,133
Here, here. Take this.

512
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,400
Here it is.

513
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,879
- How many are they?
- Many, all of these.

514
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:59,140
- Can this be used?
- I guarantee you.

515
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,873
You may try it yourself if you don't believe it.

516
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,633
Sure, sure.

517
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,333
What should I try? Isn't it gone if I try?

518
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,633
Get the tent over first.

519
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,333
I'll go first. Thank you!

520
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,700
I know it, I know it.

521
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,784
Xiaoyu, let me help you!

522
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:18,720
I'm done.

523
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,900
You help me then.

524
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,600
All right.

525
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,732
You are so virtuous.

526
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:27,190
- Move away.
- Okay.

527
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:32,733
This tent will definitely be warm to sleep in today.

528
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,466
Very warm.

529
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:36,388
- Done!
- Thank you.

530
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:39,176
- No worries.
- This is set up so badly.

531
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,066
What is so bad?

532
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,066
This side is higher than this side.

533
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,333
Let me help you.

534
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,066
Don't do it.

535
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,366
It's all set.

536
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,066
I think it looks good.

537
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,433
You just let him do it.

538
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,234
He has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

539
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,733
Are you okay?

540
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,266
I said the bracket inside is broken.

541
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:12,200
I asked you not to do it. See, you broke it. Let me fix it.

542
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
I can fix it.

543
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,700
You do it then.

544
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,833
De De, let's go. Let him fix it.

545
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,529
Let's go look at the pictures.

546
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,266
Come on.

547
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,866
Sit here.

548
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,466
Hurry up.

549
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,166
Check this out.

550
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,266
Ah, what kind of expression is this?

551
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,152
Looks so good.

552
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:41,866
- Look at this.
- I am looking.

553
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,216
Delete this one for me, this one.

554
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,812
Oh, oh. Okay.

555
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,791
Why don't we choose it later? Let's catch fish.

556
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,362
Let's catch fish.

557
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:05,171
Xiaoyu, do you know what the biggest difference between you and other girls is?

558
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:06,900
I know.

559
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,300
I am not buying your tricks.

560
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,033
Quirky.

561
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:14,168
- Xiaoyu.
- Yeah?

562
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:16,300
- I have a dream.
- What?

563
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,366
Can you become my heart in the next life?

564
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,033
Why?

565
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:25,533
Because… I will die if you don't beat.

566
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,933
Then you will get a heart attack.

567
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,800
Quirky.

568
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,264
Let's go barbecue.

569
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,077
- Be careful.
- It's done.

570
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:42,133
- No problem.
- There seems to be a fish.

571
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,300
It's a fish!

572
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,900
Lend me a hand.

573
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,433
Slowly.

574
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:50,200
Wow, we have fish to eat.

575
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,300
You are amazing.

576
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,920
Are you going to catch fish?

577
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,991
- Yeah.
- Don't go.

578
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,388
The water is very cold when the tide is high.

579
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:08,400
Don't you know I like iced water?

580
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,166
Do whatever you want.

581
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,566
Lend me the fishing net.

582
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,066
Here.

583
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,102
Let's go and grill the fish.

584
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,282
Come on!

585
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,236
Let me do it. I am professional in this.

586
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,307
Oh, sure.

587
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,346
Grill me another chicken wing.

588
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,766
Turn it over, it's burned.

589
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,226
Yes.

590
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,248
Are you stupid?
- You are the stupid one.

591
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,366
It's good.

592
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:52,140
This…

593
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,451
This is honey!

594
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,865
Sure.

595
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,100
Hey, I caught a fish!

596
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,700
Thank you.

597
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,638
This is delicious. Thank you.

598
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,833
It smells so nice.

599
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,966
I caught a fish. Let me grill it.

600
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:42,800
Oh, that's great! You grill it. Let's play games.

601
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,350
Let's play games first, let's play the games.

602
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,000
Be careful. Watch out for the fire.

603
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,320
Fifteen, twenty-five.

604
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,250
Fifteen, twenty-five.

605
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,500
- Fifteen, twenty-five.
- Fifteen, twenty.

606
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,329
- Fifteen, twenty-five.
- Fifteen, twenty.

607
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,833
Cheers!

608
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,433
This looks pretty spicy.

609
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,466
It's only tasty when it's spicy.

610
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,404
- You taste it.
- I won't eat it.

611
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:50,974
Come, let's play a game. The King game.

612
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:54,000
The person who picks the King can choose two persons to punish.

613
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,233
One card each.

614
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,733
Hey, I am the King.

615
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,003
Tell the punishment.

616
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:11,233
Um, the punishment is to eat these spicy skewers.

617
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:12,794
They are freshly grilled.

618
00:40:12,794 --> 00:40:14,001
Choose two numbers.

619
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,133
Um, number one and number five.

620
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,333
Who is number one?

621
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,776
Did you inhibit me?

622
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:24,200
I am inhibiting you, eat it!

623
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,766
- Who is number five?
- Not me.

624
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:28,633
Who is number five?

625
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,500
You love spicy food anyway.

626
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,666
Let's cheers!

627
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,666
It's really spicy.

628
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,943
- Here.
- Come on, give me the cards.

629
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,133
It dropped.

630
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,533
Hey, I am the King this round.

631
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,700
It's you. What punishment?

632
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,600
Just say it, King. Make the punishment heavier. It's just a game.

633
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,640
A princess hug then.

634
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,403
Number three.

635
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,300
Number five, number five, number five.

636
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,298
Who is number five?

637
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:32,833
I am number five. Who is number three?

638
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:36,233
I'm number three. Good brother!

639
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:39,803
It's just a game. Come on.

640
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,700
One, two, three.

641
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,140
Just hug then.

642
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,333
Hugged.

643
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,600
Come on, pick a card.

644
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,300
I am the King.

645
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,533
What is the punishment?

646
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,533
How about two people...

647
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,376
two people walk around with their shoelaces tied together.

648
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:06,866
Tied shoelaces… Okay…

649
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:08,289
Number one and two.

650
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:09,683
One…

651
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,166
I am number two.

652
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,450
I'm number one.

653
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,692
- All right, sure.
- Come on, Brother.

654
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:19,700
Didn't we always play this before?

655
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,360
Come on, Brother.

656
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,800
Okay, okay. It's done.

657
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,254
- Come.
- Right… left. Right

658
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:30,560
Hey, hurry up.

659
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,417
Right, ah… Posture...

660
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,120
- Hurry up, it's almost there.
- Xiaoyu.

661
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,663
- Grab me.
- Grab me tight.

662
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:38,808
- Walk properly!
- I'm walking properly.

663
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:41,226
- Hurry up, don't be a slowpoke.
- We have telepathy.

664
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,166
It's almost done.

665
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,833
- Come, come, come. Start a new round.
- Sure.

666
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,626
Pick a card, hurry.

667
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,366
This…

668
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,945
I am…

669
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,933
Let's play an exciting one. Face-to-face push-up.

670
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,433
How to do push-ups face to face?

671
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,900
One on top and the other on the bottom.

672
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:07,862
- What are the numbers?
- Then...

673
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:09,166
Number two and four.

674
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,476
Uh, I am number four, you must be number two.

675
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:12,869
I am not.

676
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:15,533
Who is number two…

677
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,660
Sister De De, send me later through WeChat.

678
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,589
Sure.

679
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,817
Wow.

680
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,433
I'll go for a walk.

681
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,500
Hey, be careful.

682
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,670
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

683
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,433
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

684
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:10,925
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

685
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:13,877
♫ Inadvertently ♫

686
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:19,225
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

687
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:26,030
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

688
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,990
♫ Can always protect you ♫

689
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:40,097
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

690
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:44,158
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

691
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:52,086
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

692
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:00,573
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

693
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:07,450
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

694
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:15,375
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

695
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:22,162
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
