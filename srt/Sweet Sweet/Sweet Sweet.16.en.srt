20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,540
♫ This long journey, step by step ♫

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,470
♫ Put you in the pocket, along the way ♫

♫ I smile when I think of you ♫

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
♫ I can't help ♫

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Trying to be smart with my future mother-in-law.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,466
And Mom's crazy pursuit.

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,166
In the library, when Su Mu came close to me,

30
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,466
his breathing was in my ear.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,423
I anticipated taking a boat with Su Mu.

32
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,203
Going to Bai Sha Island to look for Old Gao.

33
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,166
It wasn't a fairy tale like I imagined along the way.

34
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,633
But it feels so good running away while holding his hands.

35
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,300
Is it because you like me?

36
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,566
I find that every time I'm with you, I feel very unlucky.

37
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,200
Are you really inhibiting me?

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
Who told you to be like a crab,

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
patting someone else's shoulder without seeing clearly.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,233
If I didn't run away with you, you would have been beaten.

41
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,300
You saved me every time.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,633
Is it because you like me?

43
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,966
Right. I like...

44
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,900
Kid, what happened to your legs?

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,866
I fell down.

46
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,033
Sister will bandage it up for you.

47
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,400
It may hurt a bit.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,266
Hang in there.

49
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,500
Does it hurt?

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
You're really brave.

51
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,400
Kiddo, where's your mom?

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
- At home.
- At home?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,935
Kiddo, brother will take you home. Okay?

54
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,600
Come on.

55
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,059
Come up.

56
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,633
Be careful.

57
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,533
Where is your house?

58
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:16,333
Oh, I'm so tired recently.

59
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,866
I'll go for a swim to relax.

60
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,366
Hey, how is Old Gao?

61
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,810
He agreed to cooperate.

62
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,292
Su Mu went to the factory to find him but to no avail.

63
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,833
I asked him to try visiting Bai Sha Island.

64
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,933
Then, why didn't you go together?

65
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,400
I said to go with him.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,300
But he said he wanted to go by himself.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,466
Oh, it's okay. He likes to be alone like that.

68
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,600
Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom!

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,566
Coming.

70
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,501
- Hello.
- Come.

71
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,500
- Baby, what's wrong with you?
- Be careful.

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,266
I accidentally fell.

73
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,400
Brother and Sister brought you back?

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,725
Thank you.

75
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,594
No worries. Remember to disinfect and apply some medicine, and he will be fine.

76
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,355
Kids are very brave.

77
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,931
Judging from your accent, you are not from this island. Right?

78
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,652
Yes. We are here to find someone.

79
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,200
Who?

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,433
Uh, an old grandpa with a white beard and gray hair called Gao Bo.

81
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh… Gao Bo.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,933
He lives there.

83
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,754
Really?

84
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,800
He… shouldn't be at home.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,133
He should be riding a motorboat at the beach.

86
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,866
- Okay.
- Come in and sit for awhile.

87
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,433
It's okay, we'll just find him at the beach.

88
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,500
Okay, I won't hold you back then.

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Bye-bye, kiddo.

90
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,966
Goodbye, Brother and Sister.

91
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:37,177
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, thank you.

92
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:38,154
Let's go.

93
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:56,533
Sorry, the user you called is temporarily unreachable.

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,858
Why doesn't Su Mu answer his calls?

95
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,218
Sorry, the user you called is not in service.

96
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,881
Please call later.

97
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,733
The last time I saw Su Mu,

98
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:11,030
I feel… that he doesn't seem to like me.

99
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,333
You're over-thinking. Su Mu has always been like this.

100
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,069
He is a social phobic, mugging face.

101
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,500
No, no. We played baseball together previously.

102
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,133
He kept staring at me and Tian Tiande.

103
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,633
What is the relationship between them?

104
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,933
Didn't I tell you?

105
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,566
Cohabiting.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,450
Neighbors, neighbors.

107
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,100
Brother, let me ask you something.

108
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:40,609
Does Ding Xiaoyu have a boyfriend?

109
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,800
Don't you really like her, do you?

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,733
Yes, I do. You hurry up.

111
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,833
Single.

112
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,266
That's good.

113
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,166
The user you called is temporarily unreachable.

114
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
Nice body.

115
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,900
You see, it is destiny to like a girl.

116
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,700
I tell you. You need to meet and understand girls more.

117
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,266
Only then will you know the tricks.

118
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,066
Only then can you get them.

119
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,500
Look! That one's not bad.

120
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,566
Hey, that one. Right?

121
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,766
This one is not bad, either.

122
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,500
All seem to be good.

123
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,233
These two are also good.

124
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,666
But why are these two so familiar?

125
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,433
Mia.

126
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,600
Wang Yanyi, you are here to swim, too, today?

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Yes, such a coincidence.

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,000
Come, buddy, let me introduce you.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,333
The pretty chairman from Wei Lai Company, Mia.

130
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,723
Hello.

131
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:16,854
This is her best friend, Hui Zi.

132
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,225
She is also our business partner.

133
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,071
Hello.

134
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,814
My buddy, Li Di.

135
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,166
Hello.

136
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,533
I can't reach Su Mu's phone.

137
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,866
How are things with Old Gao?

138
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,500
Su Mu went to the factory to look for Old Gao but couldn't find him.

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,866
Hui Zi told him to go to Bai Sha Island.

140
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,033
No wonder.

141
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,966
There's no signal on Bai Sha Island.

142
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,650
Okay, we'll go and swim first.

143
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,283
Okay.

144
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,666
Do you think they will be together?

145
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,000
No way.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Their phones just can't be reached.

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,450
Don't think too much.

148
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,500
Can you stop frowning?

149
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,500
You come to swim with me more in the future.

150
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,074
This is such a good place.

151
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,607
Let's get in.

152
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,133
Get in.

153
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:13,366
Wow… This cape is really nice.

154
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,833
I haven't seen Old Gao.

155
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,650
I'll go there to have a look.

156
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,800
Are you all right?

157
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,881
I'm okay.

158
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:32,031
- I accidentally fell.
- Stand up first.

159
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,200
Here.

160
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,744
You sit down first.

161
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,966
Let me see.

162
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,195
It's okay. I was still able to walk just now…

163
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,666
And you still said it was fine.

164
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,533
You're bleeding.

165
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,000
It doesn't hurt, I'm really fine.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,933
Sit still.

167
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,483
Wait for me to come back.

168
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,533
So fierce.

169
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,933
Look at the sea.

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
Draw a little Su Su.

171
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
Draw a little Su Su.

172
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,900
Little Su Su…

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,866
Sister.

174
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,766
Why are you back?

175
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,400
Do you have alcohol and gauze at home? My girlfriend got hurt.

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,411
Oh yes, yes. Come in and I'll get it for you.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Draw another one here.

178
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,433
Where's my fish?

179
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,066
Oh… fish…

180
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,200
Oh… fish…

181
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,166
Tian Tiande!

182
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,333
Tian Tiande!

183
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,966
Tian Tiande!

184
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,566
Tian Tiande!

185
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,066
Tian Tiande!

186
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,530
♫ Summer night fireworks outline your silhouette ♫

187
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,000
♫ The night breeze secretly blows my ears ♫

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,800
♫ Waves blossoming, fairy fireworks in hand ♫

♫ Love sneaks into the stars ♫

190

♫ Backseat of the bike, drawing close to your back ♫

191
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,360
♫ What is the color of scenery passing by? ♫

192
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,658
♫ Where's the destination? Let's not stop ♫

193
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,090
What are you doing?

194
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,150
The fish disappeared. I was looking for the fish.

195
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,000
What is more important, the fish or you?

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,311
♫ Let's go together ♫

197
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,091
Were you worried that I would drown?

198
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:43,646
I can swim. Besides, the water is so shallow.

199
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:44,951
♫ Let's go together ♫

200
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:48,582
♫ Traveling around the world, or lazing in bed ♫

♫ Life is interesting because of you ♫

203
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,472
I'm still doing fine.

204
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,733
Why are you two here?

205
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,200
We're here to look for you.

206
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,733
Look for me?

207
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,200
How did you come here?

208
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,166
You swam?

209
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,756
Hey, Old Gao. Why are you so unreliable?

210
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,910
Last time you asked us to wait for you by the hut.

211
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,879
You did not show up.

212
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,782
This time, you requested us to find you here.

213
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:40,666
You were not in your factory, you made us come so far.

214
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,800
Hey, I suddenly missed my late wife.

215
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,033
So, I came back to my old house.

216
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:49,866
Why are you so weird?

217
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,800
Doing things as you like.

218
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,233
Yes, he's like you.

219
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,266
Brother, I'm helping you.

220
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,633
Hey, what's wrong with your leg?

221
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,700
- It's because of you.
- Because of me?

222
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,529
My house is here. Go and apply some medicine.

223
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,466
Here, goldfishes for you.

224
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,666
Hey! Thank you.

225
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,433
Little goldfishes! That's great!

226
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,466
Oh, my fishes!

227
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,166
So good, so good.

228
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,066
Wow!

229
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,400
This location is great.

230
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,433
Richly endowed by nature.

231
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,833
Facing the sea.

232
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,966
Backed by the green hills.

233
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,466
- Look at this design carefully.
- Be careful.

234
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:53,900
Look at the roof.

235
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
The design is also quite good.

236
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,834
Old Gao, your design is really good!

237
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,966
Stop being overwhelmed.

238
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,966
See, your leg is bleeding again.

239
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,566
Hurry up and sit on the couch.

240
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,300
I'll get you some medicine.

241
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,633
Thanks.

242
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,283
You should lose weight.

243
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,566
I-I know…

244
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,567
The gauze needs to be removed.

245
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,817
- I'll do it myself.
- Don't move.

246
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,600
When I take it off, it might hurt a little.

247
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,660
Hey, I, Tian Tiande—

248
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,933
This must be cleaned up quickly.

249
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,933
Otherwise, it will get inflamed.

250
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,466
Here comes the medicine.

251
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,507
Look at this big wound.

252
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,000
Hurry up and apply the medicine.

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,288
If this is severely inflamed, it will have to be amputated.

254
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,200
Ampu-u-

255
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,066
It might be a bit painful when applied.

256
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,216
Why don't you bite something?

257
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
I don't need it. Come on.

258
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,266
Done.

259
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,200
Does it hurt applying this?

260
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,210
Or just don't do it.

261
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,800
Hang in there.

262
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,099
Done.

263
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,300
It's done.

264
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,900
Thank you.

265
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,100
Come, come, come.

266
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,300
Take off your wet clothes.

267
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,833
Put on these dry clothes.

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,733
If you catch a cold,

269
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,899
then it'll be troublesome.

270
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,966
I'll cook for you.

271
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,133
Get up.

272
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,612
Did it hurt when I grabbed you just now?

273
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:43,133
Yes.

274
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,433
Then, why didn't you shout?

275
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:49,055
If I shouted, you would stop grabbing me.

276
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,200
Go wash up and change your clothes.

277

00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,260

What?

300
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,800
You said Mia is Su Mu's sister?

301
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,966
Yes, what's the matter?

302
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:31,708
Why are they so different?

303
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,518
One resembles the dad and one resembles the mom.

304
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,966
Different personalities since young.

305
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:39,466
Oh, what about Hui Zi?

306
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:41,033
Hui Zi?

307
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:43,366
Hui Zi is not bad.

308
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:46,016
Her personality is good and she's beautiful too.

309
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,633
But she has always liked Su Mu.

310
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:52,247
His sister also match makes them.

311
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,727
Is Su Mu's phone still unreachable?

312
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,566
He should still be on the island.

313
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,933
Bai Sha Island is having a downpour tonight.

314
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,266
I'm really worried about him.

315
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:12,200
I should have gone with him.

316
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,650
I don't know the situation now.

317
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,366
Mia, haven't left yet?

318
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,933
Not yet.

319
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,378
Did you manage to contact Su Mu?

320
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:23,666
It's so late and he isn't back?

321
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,299
No.

322
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,266
Hello, Aunt.

323
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:31,533
Tian Tiande is not with me.

324
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,158
I just called and it didn't get through.

325
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:36,975
Oh, don't worry. I'll make another call later.

326
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,633
Uh, okay, goodbye.

327
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,666
What's wrong? Can't find Tian Tiande as well?

328
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,999
Yes.

329
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,599
Well…

330
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,133
Don't think too much.

331
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,000
Don't you understand Su Mu?

332
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,333
He likes to be alone.

333
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,833
Doesn't like to socialize.

334
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,966
It's okay, it doesn't matter who he goes with.

335
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:07,766
But you both, I am really speechless.

336
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:10,500
No one has taken the initiative for so many years.

337
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,800
Just waiting.

338
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,166
Hey, who said so.

339
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,533
I confessed a few years ago.

340
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:20,833
But the result… you know it.

341
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,733
I know that girls who confessed are submissive.

342
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,100
But if it's me, I will definitely continue pursuing.

343
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,066
You still don't understand your brother.

344
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:31,766
Of course, I understand.

345
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,633
A piece of wood.

346
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,266
That's why, after so many years,

347
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,700
didn't I not let you take the initiative?

348
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah, I've said everything I should say anyway.

349
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,432
You two are really weird.

350
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,900
How can someone be so calm like you when falling in love?

351
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,800
Isn't this good?

352
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,633
What it means to happen will eventually come.

353
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,266
You can't catch up with what doesn't come.

354
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:55,900
Anyway, I'm sure I can catch up with the person I like.

355
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,033
I can't compare with you.

356
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,400
Sword King Dragon God Phoenix!

357
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Please choose.

358
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,066
Hey, come and try my signature dish.

359
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:37,566
This is your late aunt's favorite dish.

360
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,625
Emergency notice, emergency notice.

361
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,966
There will be a storm tonight.

362
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,658
All ships, do not leave the port.

363
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,866
So unlucky.
Do not leave the port.

364
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:48,644
You two have to stay here tonight.
Emergency notice, emergency notice.

365
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,000
Uh…uh?
There will be a big storm tonight.

366
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,533
All ships, do not leave the port.

367
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,833
All ships, do not leave the port.

368
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,500
Thank you for the little goldfishes you gave me.

369
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,066
Today drink to our hearts' content!

370
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:01,216
Okay, drink till we're drunk!

371
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,866
You can't drink today.

372
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,566
Why?

373
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,220
Your leg is injured, you can't drink.

374
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,300
He is right.

375
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,033
You can't drink.

376
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,800
- Then you drink with me.
- Okay.

377
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,466
Come!

378
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,200
Can you drink?

379
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,050
I can drink a little bit.

380
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,466
Hey, okay.

381
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,566
What are you doing?

382
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,200
Arranging them.

383
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,450
He has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

384
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,373
Really weird.

385
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:47,540
You two are pretty weird.

386
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:59,533
Don't you never eat shrimp because of the trouble?

387
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
I didn't say I wanted to eat it.

388
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:12,066
You kid, are the same as me when I was young.

389
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,699
Have a drink.

390
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:22,466
Hey, I remember the last time I asked you to drink, you didn't drink it.

391
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,633
She can't drink today,

392
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,733
but you drank.

393
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,244
Do you love your wife as much as I do?

394
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,566
I'm not his wife yet.

395
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:34,999
What?

396
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,900
You'll be in the future.

397
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,033
In the future?

398
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:42,466
Right?

399
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,422
Yes, everything you said is right.

400
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,866
Su Mu, are you drunk?

401
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,500
- Come and drink.
- Okay.

402
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:04,933
Girl, what are you looking at?

403
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,343
I was thinking, Su Mu is on the island tonight,

404
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:09,466
I'm afraid he won't be able to return.

405
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,274
I'm not worried about him not returning.

406
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,900
What are you worried about?

407
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,366
I'm not worried about him.

408
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:17,100
I'm worried about he and that girl.

409
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,700
Which girl?

410
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,733
It's the one who went to the zoo with him last time.

411
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,983
Are the two of them in love?

412
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,233
I have no idea then.

413
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,633
This child was dumb when he was young,

414
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,600
I always worry about how he will get along with girls in the future.

415
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,066
It looks like I'm over worrying.

416
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:38,033
Dumb? I used to think he was pretty dumb.

417
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:41,966
But now I found out that he is flirty.

418
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,500
What do you mean flirty?

419
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,433
Flirty is…

420
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,300
Is the literal meaning.

421
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,500
Literal meaning…

422
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,100
Seduce?

423
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,700
We brothers are talking together.

424
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,933
Previously, I just thought that little boys knew nothing

425
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:13,933
but act like they understand everything.

426
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,566
You are different.

427
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:19,133
You live your life clearly.

428
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:24,600
You know what you want and fight for it.

429
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,266
Like how I was when I was young.

430
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,233
I like you.

431
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,033
I like you, too.

432
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,866
Seeing you is like seeing myself in the future.

433
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:37,233
- Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.

434
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,683
Why don't you guys stop drinking?

435
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,600
Okay, stop drinking.

436
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,066
- Stop drinking.
- Stop drinking.

437
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,400
Listen to women.

438
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,466
Hey, bring me your blueprints.

439
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:06,858
Let me check for you.

440
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,960
- Hey, okay.
- ...check for you.

441
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,633
Hey, let me check for you.

442
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,633
Such a big storm and I can't reach her.

443
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:21,966
Did something happen?

444
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:24,366
Why are you in a hurry?

445
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,866
Didn't she say she'll be sending goldfish to her classmate?

446
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,233
It's your fault! Let her out.

447
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,277
What has it… Your phone…

448
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,076
Hello, Mu Mu.

449
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:38,950
Hey, Aunt.

450
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,466
I called you just now but it didn't get through.

451
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,633
The battery just ran out. Are you looking for De De?

452
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,966
Yeah.

453
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:48,966
She went out since this afternoon, I can't even reach her now.

454
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,233
Do you know where she went?

455
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:53,933
Oh, she went to Bai Sha Island with a friend.

456
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,466
Signal is bad there.

457
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,166
Don't worry.

458
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,400
I can't reach her. I thought something happened.

459
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,600
She should have reached the island before the storm.

460
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,593
Don't worry.

461
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:05,600
Oh.

462
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,533
This kid didn't inform me in advance.

463
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,533
It's okay, it's okay.

464
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:15,700
See?

465
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,066
I said it's okay, right?

466
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:26,150
Why is the word "One" always badly written today?

467
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,333
I'm going to bed.

468
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:09,700
You two sleep in the guestroom tonight.

469
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,117
There is only one room?

470
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:14,800
Is there a problem?

471
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
No problem, go to sleep.

472
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,928
Mom, I am stuck on Bai Sha Island.

473
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:36,819
Don't worry, I am very safe.

474
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,740
Are you... asleep?

475
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm... not asleep yet.

476
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,333
What's wrong?

477
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,566
Nothing.

478
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:58,300
Go to sleep.

479
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,633
Actually…

480
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,100
I want to tell you that…

481
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,433
I like you.

482
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,360
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

483
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,560
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

484
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,600
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

485
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,380
♫ Inadvertently ♫

486
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,860
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

487
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:35,430
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

488
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,930
♫ Can always protect you ♫

489
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,960
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

490
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,760
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

491
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:01,991
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

492
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:10,300
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

493
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:17,663
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

494
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,330
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

495
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,483
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
