♫ Jasmine, the air in Jasmine Day ♫

00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,225
♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, my darling ♫

00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:34,581

8
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,524

22
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,864
♫ I smile when I think of you ♫

23
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,325
♫ I can't help ♫

24
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,391
The house built by Su Mu on the hill

25
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,864
is exactly the same as the one I drew.

26
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,422
Wow!

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,033
I thought after we who were trappedcby the heavy rain all night,

28
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,066
we would have a different relationship.

29
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,890
But after parting in the morning,

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,100
he didn't even send me a message.

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,233
But seeing the successful proposal by my junior,

32
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:14,300
my mind was full of pictures hugging Su Mu.

33
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,200
But I didn't expect...

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,422
What should I do?

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,592
Proposal?

36
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,891
That painting was painted by you?

37
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,851
Yes, I painted it.

38
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,647
What if the painting gets wet?

39
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,133
It's okay, isn't it over?

40
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,589
- It's a success.
- Yes.

41
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,367
- It's okay.
- Okay.

42
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,571
- The rain seems to be subsiding.
- Yeah, it's subsiding.

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,333
Brother Li, let's go?

44
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,156
Shall we go first?

45
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:57,253
You go first. I'll wait for a while.

46
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:58,715
I'll have something else later.

47
00:02:58,715 --> 00:02:59,733
You're really not going?

48
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:00,931
I'm really not going.

49
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,497
I'm going to get the materials in a while.

50
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,384
You go ahead.

51
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,273
Let's go, Brother Li.

52
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:05,451
- Let's go, let's go.
- We'll go now.

53
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,223
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Be careful, bye.

54
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:08,966
I'll go get the car. You wait here.

55
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,441
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

56
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,566
I hustled for a few days for this rainstorm.

57
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,100
God is so unkind.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,500
The rain just stopped when I just started the test.

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,062
Hi.

60
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,800
Are you Professor Gao?

61
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,473
Then, why didn't you tell us just now?

62
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:13,045
I was not just now but I am now.

63
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,885
Hello, I am Su Mu, the designer of Wei Lai Aviation.

64
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:18,489
This meeting was to invite you

65
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,866
to help us to complete the exterior design of an aircraft.

66
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:22,436
I don't work with anyone.

67
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, no! I just want to ask you something.

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,224
Don't even think about it.

69
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,900
Professor Gao!

70
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,591
This aircraft, my colleagues and I have spent two years on

71
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,163
before we decided to launch it.

72
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:35,700
It's an original work.

73
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,866
I heard that your previous products emphasized originality.

74
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,800
Please consider it again.

75
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,500
I have considered it.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,066
No.

77
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,600
Hey, buddy!

78
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,900
- You?
- It's you!

79
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,266
Is your hand fine?

80
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,166
It's fine.

81
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,266
Thank you for that day.

82
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,700
No worries.

83
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,277
What are you doing here?

84
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,240
I helped my friend with his proposal, and it rained.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,911
We plan to celebrate at another place.

86
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,097
Hey, do you want to go together?

87
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,237
I still have something on today.

88
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:11,233
Let's go for a drink another day.

89
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,866
Ah, sure. I'll go first.

90
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,793
- Go.
- Bye-bye.

91
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,166
Find someone else.

92
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,333
I won't agree.

93
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,466
Hey, little girl.

94
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:31,800
You haven't left yet?

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,725
Yes. I am here to get the materials from you.

96
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,166
No hurry. I haven't finished cutting it yet.

97
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,448
I'll send it to you after I finish. Okay?

98
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,300
Okay. Thank you so much!

99
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,933
Hey, tell me your address.

100
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,966
Xing Yue Mountain's Peak, Container House.

101
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:52,200
Really?

102
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,026
Yes.

103
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:57,766
All right. I'll send it to you then.

104
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,533
Sorry to trouble you, Uncle.

105
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,433
Don't call me, Uncle.

106
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,131
Call me "Old Gao."

107
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,961
Old Gao…?

108
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,200
Is it appropriate?

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,386
- Appropriate. Too appropriate.
- Sure, Old Gao.

110
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,585
All right, I will leave first.

111
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,242
Walk slowly, bye-bye.

112
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,768
Bye-bye.

113
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,666
Why did you say…

114
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,800
that was my house?

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,500
Aren't you going there to make ice cream?

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Also, a stranger asks where do you live and you tell him so easily.

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,400
It's not appropriate.

118
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,966
That sounds right.

119
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,141
- 7:00 tomorrow morning.
- Go to my place.

120
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,129
I can't get up, 8:00.

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,100
Why did I promise him again?

122
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, where did you go?

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
I found Old Gao.

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Found him? Where is he?

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,750
The uncle just now.

126
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,133
All right, I will go there.

127
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,100
He left.

128
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,133
Left?

129
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,533
Did he say anything?

130
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:21,851
I am asking you.

131
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,600
Go back first. We'll discuss it later.

132
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,300
Okay.

133
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,233
Wow.

134
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,333
Why did I promise him so quickly?

135
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,400
Am I falling in love with him?

136
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,333
Impossible.

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,366
I, Tian Tiande's face can never be so thick.

138
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,466
Absolutely not.

139
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,234
- Hello.
- How's it going, Su Mu?

140
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,766
Did you meet Gao Bo?

141
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,900
He didn't agree.

142
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,466
What should we do now?

143
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,959
It's fine. I have a plan.

144
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,733
Okay then.

145
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,700
Why is this water not hot enough?

146
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,683
The water is not hot?

147
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:44,842
I will adjust it for you.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,400
It's not hot.

149
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,033
Is it hot?

150
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,199
No.

151
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,933
Still not hot?

152
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,666
It's really not hot.

153
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,562
Let me take a look.

154
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,865
What is not hot?

155
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:06,911
The water is not hot.

156
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,333
You have been inside for two hours, can it still be hot?

157
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,533
Get up quickly.

158
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,500
Wake up.

159
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,366
Hey, Lao Tian.

160
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:46,330
It seems that our daughter is making us breakfast.

161
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,433
Oh, yes.

162
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,025
A rare encounter in a century.

163
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,443
Hurry up! Don't disappoint our daughter's effort.

164
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:54,100
Oh, yeah.

165
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:58,000
Two… three…

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,033
Hey, wait!

167
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,500
Hey, where is breakfast?

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,149
- It has run away.
- Ran away?

169
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,766
Come on, let's… eat…

170
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,184
Gosh!

171
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,800
This is…

172
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,533
Oh, the storm.

173
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,766
The glass is broken.

174
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,966
I told you that the material was poor.

175
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,586
The interior renovation is bad as well.

176
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:43,266
I mean… that this house has a lot of room for improvements.

177
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:46,300
This is the opportunity God has given you.

178
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,233
Hello?

179
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,133
Okay.

180
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,166
We can't make it here today.

181
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,700
I have something urgent in the company.

182
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,229
Why don't you go to the ice cream shop and make it for me?

183
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:07,962
Okay.

184
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,371
Let's go.

185
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,333
Let's go. Let's go.

186
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,744
Hey! What's wrong with our daughter recently?

187
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,433
She has been mysterious.

188
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,366
She was talking to herself in the bathroom yesterday. Saying, "Hot, hot, hot."

189
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:35,133
And she got up early this morning.

190
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,533
It shouldn't be.

191
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,333
She only gets up at noon every day.

192
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,833
Is she in love?

193
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,573
No way. Look how silly she is.

194
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,633
I also hope she takes the time to date.

195
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:52,166
A girl who is not in love and her mind is somewhat unhinged.

196
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,933
Would it be because of the exam?

197
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,231
It's impossible. She is not a person with such a bad psychological quality.

198
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,566
It's okay. Don't worry about her.

199
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,336
Our girl, she has her own plans.

200
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:11,759
Hey. Go for a movie later?

201
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,466
Oh no, let's go to the shop first. Okay?

202
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,100
Sure.

203
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,500
I'll make you some ice cream in a while.

204
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,923
You can come and get it anytime.

205
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,514
Okay, thank you.

206
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:54,366
Yo, you are so early.

207
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,400
Accompanied him to work?

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,133
In your opinion, whether two people can be together,

209
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,066
does God have the final say?

210
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,766
In China, it should be Yue Lao who has the final say.
(is a god of marriage and love in Chinese mythology. He appears as an old man under the moon.)

211
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,733
What do you say about two people being together?

212
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,033
Should we make it clear?

213
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:16,760
Or should we ignore it and keep quiet?

214
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,966
I think you still have to make it clear.

215
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,924
Or else, how do you know? Right?

216
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:24,800
In your opinion, who should say it first?

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
Whoever wants to say it, say it first.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,588
What do you say—

219
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,733
Sister, the questions you asked,

220
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,000
asking someone like me who has never been in love…

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
Are you sure?

222
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,233
What did you say?

223
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,178
Come.

224
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:46,766
Are you in love with that guy?

225
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,766
No way, it's impossible.

226
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,733
I was just studying this matter recently.

227
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,333
I feel that it's strange.

228
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,733
Don't you think so?

229
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:59,266
What's the relationship between you two now?

230
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,100
We knew each other not long ago.

231
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,433
But we are quite close.

232
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,555
And?

233
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,700
There's no more.

234
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,366
Then, you are thinking a lot.

235
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,600
No, I just want to figure it out.

236
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,300
Hey, I've been confused and contemplating lately.

237
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm pretty depressed.

238
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,900
I told you. You are an unlucky person.

239
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,600
He is your little lucky koi. You can figure it out.

240
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,533
I really don't seem to be so unlucky lately.

241
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,833
Yeah, so, between you two,

242
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,333
there is also a metaphysical relationship.

243
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,133
Metaphysics…

244
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:44,100
What is that relationship?

245
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,152
Uh, that is…

246
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,873
I have no idea.

247
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,440
- My…
- Hey!

248
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,300
Why are you in the shop?

249
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,800
Where can I go if I'm not in the shop?

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,233
Why did you bring breakfast to the shop?

251
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,773
I brought it for both of you.

252
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,600
Are you all right?

253
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,740
Oh, you didn't give it to us at home but here?

254
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,090
Isn't it all cold?

255
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,233
I have something to do, I have to leave first.

256
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,610
- Hey, bye-bye.
- Hey!

257
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,933
See! Is she strange?

258
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:24,166
Yes. Indeed.

259
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,066
That old man never listens.

260
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,333
He asked me to leave in less than three sentences.

261
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,166
What should we do?

262
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,333
He should come to see me tomorrow.

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,933
He told you?

264
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,326
Yes.

265
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,450
Then, why didn't you tell me earlier?

266
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,000
It's just by tomorrow,

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,200
we need to come up with a design draft and find a chance to show him.

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,666
Hey, that's great!

269
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,866
Tomorrow? The time is too short.

270
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,000
It's fine.

271
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,333
Let me help you. Just like how we did before.

272
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,758
We should be able to make a draft very soon.

273
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,133
Yes, like you guys did before.

274
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,430
I'm going to buy some ice cream.

275
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,153
Do you need me to come along?

276
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,557
No need.

277
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,622
- Bill, please.
- One moment.

278
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,966
Hello, Miss. The total is 5,200 yuan.

279
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,666
H-How much?

280
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,033
The total is 5,200 yuan.

281
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,966
Does this include the delivery fees?

282
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,166
If you need the delivery, the total is 5,500 Yuan.

283
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,800
Do you need it?

284
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,266
Um… I can't bring it back if you don't deliver it to me.

285
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,966
I don't have so much money.

286
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,833
Ah, our shop supports online installment. Do you need it?

287
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,266
Do it.

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,933
Okay, the payment is successful.

289
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,533
Thank you.

290
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,200
Hey, you are here.

291
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,270
- I…
- One second.

292
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:44,566
She did it for you a long time ago. She is not here.

293
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,058
And… I don't know where she is. She didn't tell me.

294
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:50,966
I know you are here to get ice cream. Not here to find someone.

295
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:55,460
I know you two are in an ice cream relationship, right?

296
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,500
What else do you need?

297
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Bill.

298
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

299
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,200
Okay.

300
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,033
Thank you. Please come next time.

301
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,533
That was fast.

302
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,500
Why did you only buy one?

303
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,533
You want to eat one, too? Then, I'll buy another one.

304
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,166
Old rules, divide it in half.

305
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,317
[Have you eaten the ice cream?]

306
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:30,520
[I left it in the shop.]

307
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,385
[Have you eaten the ice cream?]

308
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,226
[I left it in the shop.]

309
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,311
[I ate it.]

310
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,783
[Did it taste different?]

311
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,597
- Ay?
[No.]

312
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,433
What is this?

313
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:53,979
[Yes.]

314
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:05,266
Darling, eat one more.

315
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,113
You are back.

316
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:18,000
Have you eaten?

317
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,566
Didn't eat.

318
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,027
I don't want to eat, I am too tired.

319
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,328
What did you do?

320
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:24,035
Played ball.

321
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,686
You can't skip eating even if you play ball.

322
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:34,281
Don't you think there is something wrong with our daughter?

323
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,033
Did she… really break up?

324
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,866
She didn't even fall in love, how can she break up?

325
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Okay.

326
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,233
Later, I'll go and console her.

327
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,666
Come and have a bite.

328
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,600
Done.

329
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,166
Good job.

330
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,066
Except for the most critical steps,

331
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:07,066
the preliminary prototype is complete now.

332
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:10,408
With this, I believe Old Gao will definitely work with you.

333
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,906
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

334
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:15,208
I just put in some minor effort. I'm not a genius like you.

335
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,000
It's still because of you.

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,033
Since your major is exterior designing.

337
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,166
But your ideas,

338
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,600
I never studied in school.

339
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:30,281
There is a Japanese restaurant downstairs. Do you want to eat something?

340
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,443
Let's go.

341
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,366
Girl, what's wrong with you?

342
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,933
I'm fine.

343
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,260
Are you sick?

344
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,366
Dad, I'm not sick.

345
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,633
Just a little tired.

346
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:58,786
Since you are not sick, go downstairs and eat something.

347
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,240
I do not want to eat.

348
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,030
What are you talking about?

349
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,540
How can you grow up if you don't eat?

350
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,466
Dad, what's the matter with you?

351
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,233
What matters do I have?

352
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:12,266
I see you lying here.

353
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,300
I remember when you were a kid.

354
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,900
I still remember when I hugged you for the first time.

355
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,955
You were just this big.

356
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:25,566
I always feel like it was just a few years

357
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,600
and you grew so much suddenly.

358
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,004
Dad.

359
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,133
When your mother and I got married,

360
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:39,066
I was still a poor guy.

361
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:42,600
The financial condition of the family was not good at all.

362
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,333
The only thing that makes me relieved

363
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,400
is that your mother never frowns upon me.

364
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,233
Although we've worked hard to raise you for years,

365
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,000
we've such a sense of accomplishment.

366
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:03,500
Um, what are you trying to say?

367
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,666
Dad just wanted to say.

368
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,900
If you are looking for a soulmate, you have to find someone like dad in the future.

369
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,066
Don't care about how good his conditions are.

370
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:18,000
But he must treat you well.

371
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,833
No matter what kind of guy you like,

372
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:24,633
you must not be fooled by his appearance.

373
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:28,633
You must judge a person through his heart.

374
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:33,340
Dad, I will definitely find someone like you in the future.

375
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:37,166
Oh, but a man like Dad is not easy to find.

376
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,789
He must be encountered.

377
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,223
Yes.

378
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,424
Oh, but I want to advise you.

379
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:45,066
When you are dating,

380
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:48,910
don't sleep together too early.

381
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,595
Oh, Dad, what are you talking about?

382
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:54,838
What I meant was,

383
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:57,566
no matter who the guy is in the future,

384
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,166
you have to fully understand him.

385
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,433
Well understanding of what he does.

386
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:04,473
What kind of person he is.

387
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,133
As the saying goes,

388
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:10,090
"The water that bears the boat is the same that swallows it up."

389
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,180
Ah… I know, Dad.

390
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,141
Hubby! Apple, please!

391
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:17,233
Coming!

392
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,733
Get some good rest, I'm leaving.

393
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,600
Understand?

394
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,200
He doesn't like to talk.

395
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,267
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

396
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:46,066
Loves to eat the ice cream I made.

397
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,800
It seems that apart from these,

398
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,866
I don't know anything about him.

399
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,266
He is not my boyfriend.

400
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,800
Hey, so annoying.

401
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,333
Ah, so annoying.

402
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:29,123
Your obsessive-compulsive disorder is still so severe?

403
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,643
Do you remember the first time we met?

404
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,230
It was April Fool's Day in high school.

405
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,933
To fool you, Mia messed up your room.

406
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:46,333
You did not talk to her for half a year because of this.

407
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:50,566
In the end, you forgave her during my birthday party.

408
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,566
I recall.

409
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,612
What do you think if I messed up your room at that time,

410
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,233
would you still be so angry?

411
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,999
Of course.

412
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:04,342
How are you different from my sister?

413
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,000
Oh, by the way, how are you doing recently?

414
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,272
My friend returned. Do you want to make an appointment?

415
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,600
Uh, no need. I'm okay.

416
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,784
Is it really because of ice cream?

417
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:33,100
- I remember we didn't order ice cream.
- I ordered it.

418
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,106
Didn't I share half of your ice cream just now?

419
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,866
I am giving it back to you now.

420
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,466
But I only eat that type of ice cream.

421
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,433
Why?

422
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,509
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

423
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,900
Don't be too stressed out.

424
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,900
If there are any problems with Old Gao, I will think of a solution.

425
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,933
It's okay, I can solve it.

426
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:09,300
Indeed, you have never failed.

427
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,384
By the way, you said the drawings are out and you have a plan.

428
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:16,233
What is that?

429
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,680
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

430
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,506
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

431
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,828
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

432
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:46,958
♫ Inadvertently ♫

433
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:52,206
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

434
00:30:52,206 --> 00:31:00,017
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

435
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:05,929
♫ Can always protect you ♫

436
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:13,101
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

437
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:17,154
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

438
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:25,188
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

439
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:33,572
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously
in the night sky ♫

440
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:40,449
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

441
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:48,438
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

442
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:55,274
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
