68

♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

164
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:37,665
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫

165
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,230
♫ Coffee shop at the corner ♫

166
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,030
♫ Your face under the glass window ♫

167
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,760
♫ You understand best the little things that melt in my heart ♫

168
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,030
♫ I was discovered by you when I turned around ♫

169
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:19,106
♫ This is the feeling of falling in love ♫

170
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,466
It's so nice to have a girlfriend.

171
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,716
I hope to fall in love too.

172
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,066
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

173
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,733
I will be meeting Old Gao at Bai Sha Island tomorrow.

174
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,866
Let's go together.

175
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,300
Okay… sure. When is it?

176
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,508
Tomorrow afternoon. I will come to you.

177
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,066
Okay, bye-bye.

178
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:01,831
Dad! Why are you back?

179
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:03,369
Where is my mom?

180
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,486
Upstairs, balcony.

181
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:08,086
Why did you come back earlier again?

182
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,600
What's wrong with your foot?

183
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,433
Girl, this time, we went there for horse riding.

184
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:24,933
When I saw the endless prairie my young heart surged immediately.

185
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,866
So, I went for horse galloping.

186
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:32,257
I didn't expect that horses on the grasslands were dismissive of us.

187
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:35,066
Suddenly, it gave us a U-turn.

188
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,666
I got flipped and fell to the ground.

189
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,366
In the end, I came home with your mother.

190
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,033
Are you really all right?

191
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:44,300
Oh, it's just a minor sprain.

192
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,400
Have you been in Mercury Retrograde lately?

193
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
What Mercury Retrograde?

194
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,500
If my mom inhibits you, don't travel with her next time. Okay?

195
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,210
Your mother will be upset if she hears it.

197
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,933
Oh, let me tell you.

198
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:01,400
This time, if not for your mother, my condition would have been worse.

199
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,066
Your mother is my amulet.

200
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,100
All right, all right.

201
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,473
Hey, be more careful. Okay?

202
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:10,843
- Sure.
- I go upstairs to see my mum.

203
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:12,876
- Hurry. Okay.
- Okay?

204
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,499
Mom.

205
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This earphone is used to tie your hair.

206
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,333
It's pretty fashionable.

207
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,066
Mom, aren't you supposed to be taking care of Dad?

208
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,366
What are you doing here?

209
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,020
I think I didn't take good care of you.

210
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,471
I can take care of myself. You don't have to care about me.

211
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,466
Just have fun with my dad.

212
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,295
Sure…

213
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:47,533
As soon as we went out to travel, you went out for fun too.

214
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,299
Tell me.

215
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,520
That guy just now, is he the plumber from before?

216
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,450
Yes.

217
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,600
He is really handsome indeed.

218
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,300
You're with him as soon as we go out.

219
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,980
What is the relationship between you two?

220
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,466
Can we not be like before?

221
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,466
Doing our own things.

222
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,316
Can we have some interaction?

223
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,233
Mom, what's the matter?

224
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,700
What else can I have?

225
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,133
I mean, can we have a conversation together?

226
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,833
Su Mu, when did you come back?

227
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,000
Mu Mu, we used to ask you to come back to stay.

228
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,633
But you always say it's too far.

229
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,500
Why did you come back today?

230
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,006
Because it is more convenient for work.

231
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,498
It's closer to do the flying test on the mountain.

232
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:53,325
Of course, the moment I chose this house, I told Mia to buy it

233
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,279
because of the Xing Yue Mountain next to it.

234
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,633
This is a good placeto observe the weather.

235
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,733
Now that you say it.

236
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,566
You don't live here nor do I.

237
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,866
This house is empty.

238
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,800
Why don't you move here, Mom?

239
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,057
How can this work?

240
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:07,633
How about your father if I come back here?

241
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,700
Didn't you say you have nothing to talk to my dad about?

242
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,989
What's the difference?

243
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,309
You don't understand.

244
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:13,900
We have been together for decades.

245
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,333
We are used to it.

246
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:20,066
Besides, as long as he is by my side, I feel calm.

247
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,466
We are just neighbors.

248
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:32,666
Don't fool me!

249
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,166
Are you in love?

250
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
Ah, no.

251
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,900
Then, why are you both together every day?

252
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,600
We are not together every day.

253
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
We ran into each other accidentally on the road.

254
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,926
Oh, Mom. I really didn't fall in love.

255
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:46,298
Not in love?

256
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,148
- No.
- No?

257
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,302
- No.
- Really no?

258
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:52,200
Yes, really no.

259
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,100
Really not in love…

260
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Then, what are you going to do tomorrow?

261
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400
Tomorrow, I…

262
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,090
I-I-I, tomorrow…

263
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,533
I will be going with Li Di tomorrow

264
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,291
to a baseball star autograph session.

265
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,878
- Mom, that's enough.
- Oh…

266
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:14,483
You asked so many questions once you came back.

267
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,583
Go take care of my dad.

268
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,500
How lonely you are living alone outside.

269
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,733
Mu Mu has moved back.

270
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,007
You should come back as well.

271
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,415
Forget about it.

272
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:34,733
He has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

273
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,766
I don't want to live with him.

274
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,766
Your brother is really like your father in this aspect.

275
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,427
Everything must be on the square.

276
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:46,271
- Listen. Genes are really strong—
- Mom,

277
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,940
enough.

278
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,650
Su Mu,

279
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,433
Mom will stay with you these few days.

280
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,266
I'll leave it to you to send Mom to the lecture tomorrow.

281
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,200
Okay, no problem.

282
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
You promised it so easily.

283
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,019
Makes me feel not used to it.

284
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,666
Where did you go just now?

285
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,599
You look happy.

286
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,905
The zoo.

287
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,114
The zoo?

288
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,833
What?

289
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,266
Mu Mu.

290
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,500
You went to the zoo?

291
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Mia, do you still remember?

292
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,366
He went to the zoo at the age of five and was scared to tears.

293
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,233
He never went there again.

294
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,966
Why did you think of going to the zoo?

295
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,500
Are you… in love?

296
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,183
Is that the girl from last time?

297
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,660
Are you… falling in love with her?

298
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,633
Yes, I am.

299
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,533
Well, I'm going to bed first.

300
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,300
Do you know that girl?

301
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,017
- Yes.
- How is her IQ?

302
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:05,113
- Her genes?
- Oh my goodness.

303
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,633
Say it!

304
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,600
Hey, you are not sleeping in the middle of the night.

305
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,800
What are you thinking about?

306
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,000
Every time when we came back from traveling,

307
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,266
De De is always with the plumber.

308
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,766
I asked her if she was in love.

309
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,333
She didn't even admit it.

310
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,033
She told me everything before this.

311
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,041
But she hides everything from us now.

312
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,087
Hides everything?

313
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,566
Don't you know your girl?

314
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:53,133
She can't hide anything from you.

315
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:57,835
Moreover, how can the little fox fool an old fairy?

316
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:59,414
Indeed, she can't hide from me.

317
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:02,833
Once I mentioned that plumber, her expression became different.

318
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,633
Don't you want your girl to fall in love?

319
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,001
Why do you care about her?

320
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,700
Leave her alone.

321
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,633
I have never seen her like this.

322
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,100
Hiding me from everything.

323
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,833
No, I have to catch them red-handed.

324
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,166
Hey.

325
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,865
Hey, Li Di. It's Aunt.

326
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,600
Oh, anything, Aunt?

327
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,966
Hey, I want to ask you.

328
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,600
Do you have any plans with De De tomorrow?

329
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
We will go to a fan meeting of a baseball star tomorrow.

330
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
Oh, when is that?

331
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,933
Tomorrow morning at 11:00.

332
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,750
11:00, right?

333
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,330
Oh, it's okay, get back to your work.

334
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,566
Sure. Goodbye, Aunt.

335
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:51,366
Don't ever think you can hide it from me, even if you both give me the same story.

336
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,672
11:00, right?

337
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:54,472
We will see how it goes.

338
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,633
Little crab.

339
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:13,295
Hello.

340
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,200
Hey, De De.

341
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,750
Did you lie to Aunt?

342
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,966
What lie?

343
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:23,400
The baseball's fan meeting tomorrow, are you going to ditch me?

344
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,533
Brother, that's Clayton!

345
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,401
How could I ditch you?

346
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,701
That's it. See you at the school gate at 11:00 tomorrow morning. Don't be late.

347
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,850
See you tomorrow.

348
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,633
Little crab,

349
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,966
he held my hand first at that moment.

350
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:57,716
And did not let go for a long time.

351
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:02,666
Do you think he likes me?

352
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,733
But if he really likes me, why didn't he say it?

353
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,296
It's not right.

354
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:13,781
He is so weird.

355
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,500
How can he understand seeing gorillas as watching stars?

356
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,600
So… we can't understand him with a reasonable man's thinking.

357
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:33,392
However… I think we are in love…

358
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:38,900
Ah, so annoying…

359
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,033
Is this love?

360
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:46,233
Forget about it. I'll stop thinking.

361
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:49,633
I still have to meet Old Gao tomorrow.

362
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:52,300
Let see how it goes after we meet.

363
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Okay, let's sleep.

364
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,266
Ah, see.

365
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:05,000
This is his headset.

366
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,433
Let's listen to a song.

367
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,000
Get up!

368
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,066
Mom, what are you doing?

369
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,064
Aren't you going to the fan meeting today?

370
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,804
Still sleeping!

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,000
It's only 9:00, can you let me sleep longer?

372
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,466
What sleep?

373
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:19,333
You sleep until noon every day and do nothing.

374
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:23,100
Look at this mess! What is this?

375
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:28,800
I was listening to the song last night.

376
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,766
Dilly-dallying, get out of bed now!

377
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:33,016
You look nothing like me!

378
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,216
You.

379
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:46,233
Why do you wake up early in the morning and yell at the child?

380
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,933
Just let her sleep longer.

381
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:49,933
Why sleep longer?

382
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,200
She sleeps until noon every day and does nothing.

383
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,633
Just leave her alone.

384
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,666
She will cross the bridge when she comes to it.

385
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,366
Hey, don't bother.

386
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:00,966
You continue dancing.

387
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,866
I have my own plans.

388
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,756
Plans?

389
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,033
Mom and Dad, I'm leaving now.

390
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,066
Hey, go, go.

391
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,000
Dad, what posture is that?

392
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,096
You should do it like this. Like this.

393
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:16,331
Hey! Hurry up and mind your own business. Leave your dad alone.

394
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:18,466
- Hurry up!
- Got it.

395
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,166
Our daughter is right.

396
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,789
This way.

397
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,100
- What's wrong with you?
- I accidentally kicked the table.

398
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Why are you doing this day and night!

399
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,000
I am telling you. Stay at home and wait for me to come back.

400
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,666
- Don't move.
- Not moving.

401
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,566
I will stay still.

402
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:57,500
Where is she?

403
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,433
I blame God for ruining my plan.

404
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,458
Who else, if not him?

405
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,049
♫ In the season, I got to know you ♫

406
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,944
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

407
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:29,146
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

408
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,731
♫ Inadvertently ♫

409
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:37,639
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

410
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:44,473
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

411
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:51,578
♫ Can always protect you ♫

412
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,493
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

413
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:02,615
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

414
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:09,631
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

415
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:19,053
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

416
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:25,986
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

417
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:33,843
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

418
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:39,225
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
