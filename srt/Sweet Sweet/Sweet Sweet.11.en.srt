♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, my love ♫

00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:13,104
♫ Jasmine, the air in Jasmine Day ♫

00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:17,453
♫ The break of dawn is full of longing ♫

♫ I smile when I think of you ♫

25
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,989
♫ I can't help ♫

26
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,666
Xing Yue Mountain's Peak, Container House.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,666
Why don't you say no before you agree?

28
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,200
Not hot.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,766
Saw the house being destroyed.

30
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,700
You spent all your money to repair it for him.

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,400
Okay.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,460
Just to know him better.

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,039
I want to know besides not liking to speak
[Have you eaten the ice cream?]

34
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,000
[I left it in the shop]
having an obsessive-compulsive disorder,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,233
and liking to eat the ice cream I made, and all other things.

36
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,200
Don't be too stressed

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,166
If there are any problems with Old Gao, I will think of a solution.

38
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,066
It's okay, I can solve it.

39
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,333
Indeed, you have never failed.

40
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,166
Oh, by the way.

41
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:45,190
You said the drawings are out and you have a plan. What is that?

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
Why are you here?

43
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,000
This is my studio.

44
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,266
Yes.

45
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,966
Why are you here?

46
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,266
I knew your house was in a mess,

47
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:00,366
I just wanted to tidy up for you incidentally.

48
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,766
Incidentally?

49
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,466
Just incidentally…

50
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:09,066
I redecorated for you.

51
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,878
Where is my working area?

52
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,066
Working area. Over here.

53
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,033
Look.

54
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,033
This is the working table.

55
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,533
You don't understand.

56
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,766
This job requires a combination of work and rest.

57
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,266
Work is important. Life is also important.

58
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:34,896
Why do you put the couch here, instead of the bookshelf?

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,795
I have calculated the distance between the couch and the working table. It's two meters.

60
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,766
If you are tired, you can rest as soon as you lie down.

61
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,600
What about my bed?

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,733
It was broken so I had it thrown away.

63
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,607
It's too small to be called a bed.

64
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,709
Is it comfortable to fall asleep?

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,733
Anyone? Your double bed has arrived!

66
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,395
I just want you to sleep more comfortably.

67
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,275
Done. It's all taken care of.

68
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,686
Amount received: 20,000.00 yuan.

69
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,833
Why did you transfer money to me?

70
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,733
You need money for renovation.

71
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,733
But 20,000.00 yuan is too much. It's too so much!

72
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,666
Plus labor costs.

73
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,400
Labor?

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,168
It should be more than this if you include the labor cost.

75
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,933
Then…

76
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,500
I'll do it myself.

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,833
Hey, I'm kidding. I can't take your money.

78
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,140
You don't want money, what do you want?

79
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,766
I want…

80
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,700
I don't want anything.

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh, right.

82
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,366
I changed the lock for you.

83
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,900
Here you go, the keys.

84
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,807
Okay, it's all done!

85
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:27,097
I am a little hungry.

86
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:29,533
What do you want to eat?

87
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,266
I'll eat whatever you want to eat.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,666
Okay.

89
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,300
Why don't you eat?

90
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,766
- It's too troublesome.
- Troublesome?

91
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:22,266
- Eating is troublesome?
- Why are you here?

92
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:25,333
This video is ready. I brought it over to you.

93
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,853
- That's so fast! Thank you!
- I am just dropping by.

94
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:34,133
Oh, I haven't been to Xing Yue Mountain for a long time. So I am dropping by.

95
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,760
- Come and let's eat.
- Sure.

96
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,265
I love this a lot. Come on.

97
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,490
Have some.

98
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:47,548
It tastes good.

99
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:50,200
Hey, who designed this house?

100
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,131
He built it. I did the interior renovation.

101
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,355
From what I saw in your painting,

102
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:59,766
I know your aesthetics are number one!

103
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,865
If you have time, you can also help me with designing.

104
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:03,966
Sure, no problem.

105
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,233
I had a hut made for my wife in the past.

106
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,533
But she passed after not staying for long.

107
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,554
Where did she go?

108
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,866
Where?

109
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,333
Heaven.

110
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, Old Gao. I am sorry.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,408
It's okay. Hey, take me for a walk.

112
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,010
- Sure! - Let's go.
- Let's go.

113
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,100
Hey, let me tell you. This decoration is minimalism.

114
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,925
- Black, white and gray: these three colors…
- Oh.

115
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,519
It's character.

116
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,733
It really suits his mugging face.

117
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,133
Hey, take a look at this.

118
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,209
Hey, look at this. It's very good.

119
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,619
Good, good.

120
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,205
Hey, did you paint this painting?

121
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,672
Yes.

122
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,366
If not for your painting,

123
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:55,172
without these colors, it would look even more lonely.

124
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,466
That's true.

125
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,397
Hey, let me take you to the rooftop to have a look.

126
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,800
Sure.

127
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,866
The rooftop, I had designed for the proposal.

128
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,193
Really? Let me take a look.

129
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:07,401
- Beware of the steps.
- Okay.

130
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,700
Hey, it's really nice.

131
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,400
My rooftop's location is exceptionally good.

132
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
Ventilated on all sides.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Surrounded by the sea on three sides.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Do you think it's nice?

135
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,266
Yes, really nice.

136
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,500
I like this so much!

137
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,733
Can I find you often for fun?

138
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,333
Yes.

139
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,033
Is it okay?

140
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,257
Sure.

141
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,466
You're welcome any time.

142
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,500
Do you live together?

143
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,633
Live together.

144
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,066
Then it will be easy.

145
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:47,000
I can come often then. I'm leaving.

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,266
Hi. I have a blueprint here. Would you please give me your opinion?

147
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,166
What's the hurry? Discuss it in the evening.

148
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,067
I will bring two bottles of wine tonight. Let's have a good chat.

149
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,672
I have something on. I am leaving.

150
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,088
- Old Gao, let me walk you.
- It's okay.

151
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,833
Hey, Old Gao is really a nice man.

152
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,333
What are you drawing?

153
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,566
You wanted to ask for his help?

154
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,249
No worries, I can help you.

155
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:28,933
We have a very good relationship.

156
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:33,333
This evening, I will ask him to get this done for you.

157
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,407
Well, you live here from now on.

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,233
- Live here?
- Yeah.

159
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,600
Isn't this your… workshop?

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,033
Half of this house... belongs to you.

161
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,800
You can come here to paint in the future.

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I can understand him better through this.

163
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,866
Half?

164
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:02,100
Didn't you give me the money?

165
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,672
Well… You can return the money to me.

166
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,200
Sure. Then I won't return it.

167
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,366
I can live here.

168
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,866
But I need half of the space.

169
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:19,133
Half of it for working. Another half for resting.

170
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:24,333
Okay. Didn't you buy a double bed?

171
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,900
Okay. It's all set then.

172
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,500
Since you begged me, I'll think about it.

173
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,833
But my mother won't let me stay over.

174
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,633
But it does not matter. I'll go back and discuss with her this evening.

175
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:49,366
We are good neighbors. It shouldn't be a big problem.

176
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,066
Hey, Dad.

177
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm on Xing Yue Mountain.

178
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,433
I'll go back soon.

179
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,300
Yeah, okay.

180
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,566
Ah, all right. I think I'm almost done, then I'll leave first.

181
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:10,733
Remember to clean up the crayfish outside.

182
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:14,289
Put them into the fridge, I'll continue eating when I am back.

183
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:37,266
Why did I promise him again?

184
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,133
How should I tell my parents?

185
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:46,333
I either say that my friend has broken up.

186
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:51,000
No way. Or tell them that I'll be living at Mu Mu's house.

187
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,766
Forget it. Tell them the truth.

188
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Dad. Mom.

189
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,633
Come here.

190
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:35,666
Dad. Mom. Why are you sitting so straight?

191
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,600
And not watching TV.

192
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,966
You are scary.

193
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:42,166
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

194
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,533
What's the matter?

195
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,807
Girl. This time, it's dad's fault.

196
00:14:55,807 --> 00:15:00,633
Dad accidentally grabbed two more travel tickets.

197
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,700
This is a trip to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.

198
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,933
Time is tight. We have to leave tonight.

199
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,800
You see, the luggage is ready.

200
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,233
Dad, how can you change so easily?

201
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,241
You asked me to spend more time with you two last night.

202
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,400
Why travel again?

203
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:34,166
Wife, otherwise, we bring our girl along.

204
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,316
No!

205
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:37,800
I don't want to be the third wheel between the both of you.

206
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
I can live by myself.

207
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,636
I will take care of myself.

208
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,979
Anyway, I have been used to it since I was young.

209
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,301
The most important thing is your happiness.

210
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,275
If you're happy, I will be happy.

211
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't worry about me. Don't care about me.

212
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,566
Safe trip!

213
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,533
Be careful!

214
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:02,100
Wife, do you think we have crossed the line?

215
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
We never bring our daughter along on every trip.

216
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,433
It's too much.

217
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,433
How about this?

218
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,166
No more next time.

219
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,866
Okay, no more next time.

220
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,800
We still have to go this time.

221
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,633
Hurry up! Otherwise, we will miss the flight.

222
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,939
Hurry up!

223
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Really don't care.

224
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,907
Please don't care about me.

225
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't care about me.

226
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,433
It's God's will!

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,333
Tada! I'm here!

228
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,066
You are here.

229
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,533
Why hasn't Old Gao come yet?

230
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,233
Yes.

231
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:14,400
I… got two bottles of good liquor from my dad's wine cabinet.

232
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
He is reluctant to drink them.

233
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,706
He only drinks them during Chinese New Year.

234
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:20,333
I think Old Gao will definitely like it.

235
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,070
Aren't you afraid that your dad will blame you?

236
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,600
I'll buy him two more bottles during New Year's. I just have to put them back.

237
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,366
Can that be the same?

238
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,600
What's the difference?

239
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,966
Okay, get back to your work! I'll wander around by myself.

240
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:13,400
You really took pictures of me that day?

241
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,333
So ugly! Delete them.

242
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
Delete this too!

243
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
This one is too ugly!

244
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:26,195
Why do you look at me? I am not ugly, but your picture is!

245
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:27,961
Delete it!

246
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,613
This one!

247
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Delete this too!

248
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,666
This…

249
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,233
Who told you to delete this?

250
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,571
Didn't you ask me to delete it?

251
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,632
Male chauvinist!

252
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,369
What are you looking at?

253
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,300
Go back to your work!

254
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,666
Why isn't Old Gao here yet?

255
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,531
Su Mu.

256
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,233
Su Mu.

257
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,766
Mugging little brother!

258
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,705
I…

259
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:14,133
kind… of…

260
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:19,116
like you.

261
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,933
Hi, Mom.

262
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,233
Understood.

263
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,800
It is too late now.

264
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,766
Why don't you go back?

265
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,933
He might not be coming tonight.

266
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,100
Of course, I have to go back if he doesn't come.

267
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,766
Otherwise, do I live with you?

268
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:16,600
What a joke!

269
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,733
I'm leaving now!

270
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,133
I almost forgot this.

271
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,900
Hey!

272
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,800
Now... it's late.

273
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,666
How about…

274
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,266
I send you back?

275
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,566
Of course, you need to send me.

276
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:54,233
Don't you know who I am now?

277
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,333
Don't you know how important I am to you?

278
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,766
Stop dreaming, hurry up!

279
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:04,100
Such a slowpoke, I'll wait for you outside.

280
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,342
I am waiting for you. Hurry up!

281
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,666
Go inside quickly.

282
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,266
Your parents are all asleep.

283
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:49,667
No, they are on vacation now. I am alone.

284
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,330
Oh.

285
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:01,433
Well… Let's have breakfast together tomorrow morning.

286
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,588
Okay. Sure, breakfast.

287
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,716
- Good night.
- Good night.

288
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:22,233
You still want to ask me to go to the mountain.

289
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,600
Why make unnecessary moves?

290
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,866
I really don't know what is on your mind.

291
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,366
Kids nowadays…

292
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,833
why are they like this?

293
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,566
Not brave at all.

294
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,766
He scared me.

295
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,966
Oh, the little brother is not up yet.

296
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,766
It's okay. I'll wait for him.

297
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
Hey!

298
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,350
Good morning.

299
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,559
Hurry up!

300
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,266
What's with the attitude?

301
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,533
I am not ready yet.

302
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,700
Wait for me, ten minutes.

303
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:10,333
Why are you riding the bike? Get on my motorbike.

304
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,966
Don't worry. Take your time.

305
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:06,266
I'll clean up slowly.

306
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,766
Take it.

307
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,266
This?

308
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,733
What's wrong?

309
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,816
Where's the milk?

310
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,396
I have it.

311
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,733
He said he wanted to cook for me.

312
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:32,666
Gave me this and instant bread.

313
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,032
What are you doing?

314
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,760
There is dirt on your face.

315
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,608
- Where?
- I'll wipe it for you.

316
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,600
Done.

317
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,766
Thank you.

318
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:33,233
You are welcome.

319
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh, what's going on?

320
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,700
I am out of inspiration.

321
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,800
Hey, Su Mu.

322
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:56,666
Make me some ice cream.

323
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,300
You see, firstly,

324
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,687
how many times have I made ice cream for you? Right?

325
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,166
Secondly,

326
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,500
we don't know when Old Gao will come.

327
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,800
My empty stomach…

328
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,130
I'm afraid that the wine hasn't settled yet.

329
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,756
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

330
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:43,600
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

331
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,012
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

332
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,114
♫ Inadvertently ♫

333
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:55,239
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

334
00:30:55,239 --> 00:31:01,467
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

335
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,400
♫ Can always protect you ♫

336
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:16,084
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

337
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:20,200
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

338
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,553
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

339
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:36,650
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

340
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:43,449
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

341
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:51,475
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

342
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:57,672
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
