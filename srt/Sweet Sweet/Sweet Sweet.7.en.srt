- How dare he came to my house and question me.
- Why didn't you answer my calls?

25
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,359
Why didn't I make him ice cream?
What calls?

26
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,709
Since this is a promise I made, I won't break it.

27
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,998
- I delivered it through delivery services, wouldn't that be fine?
- Your takeaway.

28
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:06,391
But such a coincidence. I met his asshole friend again.

29
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,491
Where is Mr. Wang?

30
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:11,665
- Asshole!
- Friends of an asshole are not good people as well.

31
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:16,666
Then, Su Mu did something that is despicable.

32
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,186
I should be blamed for not running away.

33
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:27,366
We are home!

34
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,433
Slowly, Mom.

35
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,109
- Here.
- Li Di, thank you for your hard work.

36
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:45,533
No problem at all!

37
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,870
Hey, Li Di. Come over to have dinner later.

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,110
Your uncle will cook your favorite boiled beef.

39
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,100
- My friends are all on the mountain and I have to pick them up.
- Oh, yes, yes.

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,366
- After this matter...
- Hurry up then. I'll go first then.

41
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,100
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,233
- Be careful on the road.
- Be careful.

43
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,030
Hey, De De, don't forget about the proposal tomorrow.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,298
Go back!

45
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,067
Hey. This guy... Did I meet him somewhere?

46
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,108
Enough, Mom, stop looking. Let's go.

47
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,859
Let's go.

48
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,951
Didn't you promise to go to the movies with me?

49
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:42,217
I am busy. I still need to attend tuition classes these days.

50
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,580
What are you so busy with? You already promised me!

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,930
We will go next time, for sure.

52
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:52,733
You should do what you promised. Or else, don't give her your promise.

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,930
Certainly!

54
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,800
He is sick.

55
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:04,523
We finally got home. Wifey! I put the luggage on the second floor.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,290
That person looks so familiar.

57
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,970
I seem to have met him somewhere.

58
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:21,320
Oh, he looks like the plumber.

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
Mom... you think carefully.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,700
How can a plumber live opposite our house?

61
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,000
He is the new neighbor.

62
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,197
That's right, too.

63
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:33,390
Mom, don't think too much. I'm sleepy.

64
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,010
I'm going to rest upstairs. You should rest early, too.

65
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,230
Go on.

66
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,900
Teenagers nowadays... all look quite handsome.

67
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,766
Hello.

68
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:55,316
Hello. What kind of sofa do you want for your house?

69
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,750
You can choose it yourself. Pick one you like.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,700
I'll move over when it's done.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,950
Sure, I will let you know later.

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,430
- Yo, who is this?
- One second!

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,091
Why don't you answer the call?

74
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:22,427
Why are you here? My phone was charging, I did not hear the call.

75
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,650
Why is it me? I am here to look for you.

76
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,330
What's the matter?

77
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,954
- Hey, Uncle and Aunt, you are back.
- Mu Mu, you are here for De De?

78
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:34,434
- Yes, I was looking for her, but her cell phone was dead.
- Oh.

79
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,879
I'll get you a glass of water. Have a seat.

80
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,200
You guys are back just in time. I want to discuss something with you.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,715
- Ah, please say it.
- It's about... this afternoon.

82
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:49,933
Mr. Wang from the Wei Lai Aviation Company opposite us, came and said he was having a party tomorrow.

83
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,226
They need us to provide them cold drinks and ice cream for 200 people.

84
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:56,380
- 200 people?
- Oh...

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Company party for 200 people. There is a lot of people.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm afraid we can't handle it.

87
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,433
That's why, I think the amount is pretty large.

88
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:13,410
He said we are a small company but we are close to them, that's why they choose us.

89
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,140
What did he say about us?

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,560
Small company? Who is he to look down on us?

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,240
Is Wei Lai a big company?

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,140
Dad, don't you have those seniors and juniors? Give them a call.

93
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,870
If we can't handle such a small order, how can we stay in this industry later?

94
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,030
Take the order! We must take it.

95
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:34,589
That's right! Tian, we are a time-honored brand.

96
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,610
We fight for honor, not money.

97
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,230
Don't let them look down on us in this newly moved place.

98
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,970
Of course.

99
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,133
Hey, Junior. Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

100
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,830
Oh, that's great! Ah...

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,310
Bring Huang from your shop with you.

102
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,210
Nothing much.

103
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,700
I took a big order. Come over tomorrow and help me make some ice cream.

104
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,533
Sure! Once it's confirmed, I'll pick you up tomorrow afternoon.

105
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,440
Hey, great, great!

106
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,720
Done?

107
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,030
My daughter is right!

108
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,890
We can't be looked down on by them.

109
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,660
Bring it! We will take this order!

110
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,966
Of course, Wei Lai Aviation. Fly... fly... They are cocky now.

111
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,297
Who are you to look down on us?

112
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,900
All right! Then I will make some samples for them early tomorrow morning.

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,650
Um... I'll go with you.

114
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,933
- What's the situation?
- Sit down.

115
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,333
Why all the cloaks and daggers?

116
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,990
I just saw him at the gate of the neighborhood.

117
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,760
Which him?

118
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,360
That one!

119
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,600
What's with him?

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,033
Hey, I greeted him but he ignored me.

121
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:13,390
He is a weirdo. Don't take it to heart. I'm not surprised.

122
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,970
It's not the weirdest.

123
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,930
He was particularly weird when he was on the phone with someone.

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,070
What is weird?

125
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,370
It seemed to be a woman on the other end.

126
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,650
What if it's a woman? None of my business.

127
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,530
What did he say?

128
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,640
I didn't intend to listen to others talking on the phone.

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,700
I only heard it vaguely... He said...

130
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,880
- Just say it!
- Just choose the sofa you like.

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,060
Wow, he spoils this girl so much.

132
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:46,830
He also said, "I'll move over when it's done."

133
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,300
He seemed to say so.

134
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,800
They want to move and live together?

135
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,100
Is he not living here anymore?

136
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,690
Go ahead and move. Isn't it good to move?

137
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,330
I don't have to make him ice cream every day.

138
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:05,566
Didn't he tell you?

139
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,580
Why should I listen?

140
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,700
He called his girlfriend at the gate of the neighborhood.

141
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,370
What is he showing off? Who doesn't have a girlfriend? Huh!

142
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,000
I took a good look at his face today.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,166
His Jupiter should have entered the Ascendant.

144
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,800
A bit of positive luck in love is about to kick in soon.

145
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,850
And he should be passionately in love with his partner and cannot be separated.

146
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,380
Who is separating him?

147
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,630
His muggling face... no one wants him even if were single.

148
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:37,420
No way. You need him to survive your Mercury retrograde.

149
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,480
Who needs him to survive?

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,170
Mercury retrograde, I'd rather drown to death.

151
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,823
- You seem angry...
- Who is angry?

152
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,450
This is the usual me. Do you think I'm angry?

153
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

154
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:29,466
I sprained my leg wearing these high-heeled shoes.

155
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,033
Mine are also in pain. Hang in there.

156
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,080
We cannot lose our spirit.

157
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:38,433
We are here. Let's go.

158
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,433
Where is the meeting room?

159
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,535
Uh, may I know who you are?

160
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,333
We are from...

161
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,166
Tian Tian De Ltd Company.

162
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,061
We are your dessert supplier for tonight's party.

163
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,680
Ah... You are from the ice cream shop across the street, right?

164
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,866
Yes.

165
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,200
Sure, Mr. Wang is waiting for you. Come with me.

166
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,203
Mr. Wang, staff from Tian Tian De Ltd Company is here.

167
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:40,533
Okay. Get back to work.

168
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,700
- Why are you...
- What about me?

169
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,666
Enemies are destined to meet.

170
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,900
Okay, let's go to the conference room for a meeting.

171
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,000
Just discuss it here.

172
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:01,100
Anywhere is fine.

173
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,456
These are all the flavors of our ice cream shop.

174
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:18,600
For the style, you choose it on our website.

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,333
Try it.

176
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:47,006
Can you stop making the "Um" sound? Does it taste okay?

177
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:55,633
Any problem?

178
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Are you the manager?

179
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,366
Yes.

180
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,970
Try it.

181
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,330
I... I...

182
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:16,866
Taste it.

183
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,243
Is it sweet?

184
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,633
Sweet.

185
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,683
It's sweet if you say so.

186
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,755
Okay, let's sign the contract.

187
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:33,275
- That's it?
- Someone will pick you up after signing the contract.

188
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:36,059
- Any problem?
- No problem.

189
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,140
- I'm asking you.
- Huh?

190
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,000
No problem.

191
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,100
Xiao Fei, take them to sign the contract.

192
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,829
This way, please.

193
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,900
Mu Mu, let's go.

194
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,649
Hey, the data you uploaded is different from the last time. Check it carefully.

195
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,366
One moment, I will print the contract out.

196
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,808
Somewhere it not right.

197
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,421
I shouldn't have worn this.

198
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,233
It's so uncomfortable and my feet hurt.

199
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,168
You knew Mr. Wang before this?

200
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:21,933
Enemies are bound to meet on a narrow road.

201
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,300
What's wrong?

202
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,433
I feel that Mr. Wang is quite good.

203
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,300
He is quite handsome and nice to talk to.

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
But he's an asshole.

205
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,500
- He is a complete asshole.
- Really?

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,466
Why didn't I see that he is an asshole?

207
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,400
Is he an asshole if you can see it?

208
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,654
I advise you to stay away from him.

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,633
Okay, sign here.

210
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,633
Why draw the curtains during the day?

211
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,866
What is there to hide?

212
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,200
Who? What's wrong?

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Let me tell you, Mu Mu.

214
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,160
All men in this company are scumbags.

215
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,287
Let's go.

216
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,243
Did she mean you?

217
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,700
I didn't do anything to her.

218
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,066
The celebration this time is mainly to serve the partners.

219
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,100
After all, it is a big business.

220
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,166
I know that you don't like socializing but you are the main designer.

221
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,860
You cannot be absent.

222
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,133
Got it.

223
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,633
Also, a few partners will attend the celebration later.

224
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,733
Although you and they know each other,

225
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,333
you will still have to socialize with them.

226
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,733
After all, they value you.

227
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,833
Why is it so troublesome?

228
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,933
Don't worry. I am here.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Doing business is not like designing.

230
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,200
Do you think buying one set of products will suffice?

231
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,787
You still need to maintain good relationships with them.

232
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:50,500
You have been busy for two years. It's time to harvest your fruit.

233
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,930
Treat it as a celebration for yourself. Hmm?

234
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,166
Okay, got it.

235
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,066
You don't need to be nervous.

236
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,300
I'll do the socializing part.

237
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,933
By the way, we can announce our relationship.

238
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,783
You just show up with me.

239
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,366
Sure, I'll listen to you.

240

242
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,872
For the reparation for the celebration tonight,

243
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,933
the logistics team has already been here since this morning.

244
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,725
- It's almost done.
- That's good.

245
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:22,666
Also, staff from the dessert company were here.

246
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,741
I just tasted it.

247
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,598
It was good. I've hired them.

248
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,975
Sure. Keep the progress in check.

249
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:31,366
Sure. I'll go now.

You are back.

Daughter, how was it?

252
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,780
Oh, it's okay. Isn't it just a small order?

253
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,417
It doesn't matter if the deal didn't close.

254
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,648
We are not arrogant with success, nor discouraged by failure.

255
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,333
Never step back because of failures.

256
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,233
The journey is long and endless, right?

257
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,466
Also, your mother's shop doesn't need that order.

258
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,066
It's okay, it's okay!

259

Tada!

260
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,300
No big deal.

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,800
We settled it within minutes.

262
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,128
We have to prepare at 4:00 p.m.

It was made by me.

325
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,272
Then, send it to me later.

326
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:18,966
Hey, you!

327
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,566
I'm so busy today.

328
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:36,873
Yet, I still have to make ice cream for you.

329
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:38,740
For whom?

330
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,575
Nothing.

331
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,025
Hey, make some ice cream for Chairman Mia and send it over to her.

332
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,533
Don't stay there. Hurry up and send it over.

333
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,400
Hi, here is your ice cream.

334
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,433
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

335
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:21,234
- I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. I didn't see her coming.
- It's okay.

336
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,800
Why are you're so careless?

337
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,450
Don't you see when you walk? Don't you have eyes?

338
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,833
Mind your words!

339
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,124
- It's okay, Miss.
- Go back to work.

340
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,800
I am sorry.

341
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,287
- Are you okay?
- Go and clean yourself first.

342
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,533
Are you all right?

343
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,466
I am fine.

344
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:55,833
What happened, Miss?

345
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,600
Nothing.

346
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,730
Tian, we are running out of ingredients here.

347
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,666
Okay.

348
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,326
Miss, you keep an eye here.

349
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,434
The ingredients aren't enough. I'll go and get some with your mom.

350
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,951
Okay.

351
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:12,266
I have to make another one for you.

352
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:19,625
You wrapped your coat around her. Why should I do it for you?

353
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,216
I'd rather feed the dog than you.

354
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,179
- Hey, De De!
- Huh?

355
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,000
Why are you eating?

356
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,249
Hey, Mu Mu.

357
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,359
- I have figured it out.
- What's that?

358
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,366
Look how matchy they are.

359
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:42,700
Why should I be mad here?

360
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,366
Let me tell you. The horoscope is not accurate at all!

361
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,266
How can good things happen to me?

362
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,000
Lies! All are lies!

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,166
Yeah, it's okay. You still have me.

364
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,700
- I want to get some wine.
- Hey! Hey!

365
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:16,933
Miss, are you okay?

366
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:22,355
I'm okay. I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

367
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,542
I am sorry.

368
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,233
It's okay. As long as you are fine.

369
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,633
Where is my ice cream?

370
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,366
I didn't have time to do it.

371
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:38,533
You have time to do it for others but no time to do it for me?

372
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:41,133
Can't you see so many people are here?

373
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,550
I was talking about two days ago.

374
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,866
I didn't have time as well two days ago.

375
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,600
I was helping a friend to propose.

376
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,133
Help... a friend to propose?

377
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,300
Yes, I am in charge of that.

378
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,666
Don't you have a girlfriend?

379
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,781
You can ask her to do it for you.

380
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,749
Tell me.

381
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:23,466
Did you eat my ice cream?

382
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,299
I didn't.

383
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,216
This is my elder sister, Mia.

384
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,100
This is your neighbor. Tian Tiande.

385
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,066
I'll see you later.

386
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,813
Let's go, Sis.

387
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:41,225
I bought the raw ingredients. Let's do it together.

388
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Hey, why is your face blushing?

389
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,590
Do you have a fever?

390
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,100
Dad, I'm fine.

391
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm feeling a little hot. I'm going for a walk by the beach.

392
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,290
Hot?

393
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,733
Why am I feeling a bit cold?

394
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:10,100
That person is his sister?

395
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,566
And he kissed me in front of his sister.

396
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,600
Could it be...

397
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,166
he likes me?

398
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,366
I think perhaps...

399
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,900
Little crab, why are you here?

400
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,066
Hey, little crab.

401
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:50,366
Do you know what kissing feels like?

402
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:55,133
You definitely have no idea.

403
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,700
Because you don't have soft lips.

404
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,166
Let me tell you.

405
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,466
The feeling of kissing

406
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:07,233
is refreshingly sweet.

407
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:17,932
♫ In the season, I got to know you ♫

408
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:22,720
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

409
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,284
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

410
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:27,523
♫ Inadvertently ♫

411
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:34,501
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

412
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:41,001
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

413
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:47,457
♫ I can always protect you ♫

414
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:55,279
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

415
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,440
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

416
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,490
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

417
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:15,854
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

418
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:22,811
♫ That innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

419
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:30,614
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

420
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:36,773
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
