♫ I can't help it ♫

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,690
I waited until finally the owner of the car showed up.

28
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,960
As expected, it was a woman.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,025
Patting his head?

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,276
Stop overthinking!

31
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,800
My good friend's birthday celebration was more important.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,110
Next time you come find me, I'll refuse to make you more ice cream.

33
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,600
But I didn't expect that

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Su Mu would come to me so soon for ice cream.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,816
Still want it, huh? You won't get it!

36
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:19,400
What do you want?

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,577
Who is it?

38
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,465
What do you want?

39
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,530
Why didn't you answer my call?

40
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,524
What call?

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,973
That was you then?

42
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:49,800
What was it?

43
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:53,322
You didn't make me any ice cream today.

44
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,366
Oh, I get it now.

45
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:01,468
The ice cream that I owe you, I'll make it up to you.

46
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:07,200
- Are you… drunk?
- No way.

47
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,012
Controlling me?

48
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,266
Why not focus on her?

49
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,266
She's looking for you again.

50
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,366
Su Mu, you're here?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,966
Oh… it's not her.

52
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,900
Why are you here?

53
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,734
What do you mean why am I here?

54
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:39,538
I've lived here more than ten years. Where should I be?

55
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,656
Then… you two are?

56
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,484
Why are you in her car?

57
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:46,574
Oh, I'm in her car because…

58
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,713
I need to take a call.

59
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:49,937
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,252
Why aren't you here yet?

61
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,972
Shanshan, I'll be there soon.

62
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,866
My boss drank too much and I just brought her home.

63
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,502
I'm handing off some documents to my buddy now.

64
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:58,866
Is that true?

65
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,398
How could I lie to you? It's true.

66
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,656
Jerk.

67
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,866
- Didn't you say it's your buddy?
- Shanshan…

68
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,609
It's not what you think. Listen to me.

69
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:09,367
That's not a girl. Er no, it is but not that kind of girl.

70
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,767
- Asshole.
- Shanshan, listen to me. Hello…?

71
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,445
You're messing things up.

72
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:20,311
Hey, Su Mu.

73
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,498
She really lives here?

74
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,734
How do you know each other?

75
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,698
Not only do we know each other, we have some funny stories.

76
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,193
Why are you staring at me like that?

77
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,723
I-I-I don't even know what her name is.

78
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,708
I think she sells ice cream nearby.

79
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,900
She disses me whenever she sees me.

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,864
I've never seen such a difficult person.

81
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,255
Difficult?

82
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,598
It's you who is too soft.

83
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:53,866
Are we friends or not?

84
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:56,866
I bring you these and you treat me like this?

85
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,539
What's the relationship between you two?

86
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,460
What do you think? Neighbors.

87
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,307
Neighbors…

88
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:11,500
and nothing else?

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,148
Why? You like her?

90
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,842
How could I like her?

91
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:20,140
Anyone unlucky enough to like her is cosmically unlucky.

92
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,292
Why are you staring at me again?

93
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,866
There's no problem with the blueprints.

94
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,772
Have them do it tomorrow.

95
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,475
Okay.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,966
You… like her?

97
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,973
I like the way she called you a jerk.

98
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,566
You… like her?

99
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,321
The ice cream that I owe you, I'll make up to you.

100
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,500
Jerk.

101
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,980
[DD: Eat something after you wake up. Don't go to work on an empty stomach.]

102
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,500
[DD: Don't forget to come here this afternoon.]

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,050
[Don't worry, I won't forget.]

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,700
[See you this afternoon.]

105
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:05,839
I seem to have scolded him last night.

106
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, so be it.

107
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,300
He already has a girlfriend but still wants me to make him ice cream?

108
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,281
I've got to cut him off.

109
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:19,631
If I fall for him again, I'm no better than a puppy.

110
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:28,300
If he's some ordinary, mediocre, mid-level company man,

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,257
how could he live in such a big house?

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,566
It turns out he's a gigolo.

113
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,566
Can't you be a little more worthy?

114
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:39,909
Are you that incompetent?

115
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,433
Why? Why?

116
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,606
Where's my ice cream?

117
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,944
You didn't give me any yesterday.

118
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:55,344
You promised you'd deliver it to me today.

119
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,998
I'll deliver it to you in two hours!

120
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,000
- Hello!
- How's it going over there?

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,757
The data part is done.

122
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:44,117
As long as the strategy is successful, we can go to launch.

123
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,104
That's great!

124
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,833
In a few days time, we've got the banquet lined up.

125
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,400
Hui Zi will bring the clients from last time.

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,143
Ms. Liu from the setup company will also be there.

127
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:56,200
The project is on track for success.

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,113
- Also, our relationship will be announced on the same day.
- Okay.

129
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,466
That's all for now. Get some good rest.

130
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,300
I am very worried about you.

131
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,045
I'm fine.

132
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,708
You don't seem all that well these last few days.

133
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,100
No.

134
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,866
That shouldn't be.

135
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,700
Logically,

136
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,566
Jupiter is now ascendant for your sign.

137
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:37,033
Don't you know? Jupiter represents luck and expansion.

138
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,098
I also see that recently

139
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,589
you have a peach blossom aura, something good must be coming to you.

140
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,633
Nothing good will happen.

141
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,707
Nothing good is coming.

142
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:52,400
Did you two quarrel?

143
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,568
Not settled yet?

144
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:55,933
Quarrel with who?

145
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,681
There's nothing between me and anyone,

146
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,681
so you mean a quarrel with myself?

147
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,900
- Don't sell these. Save them.
- Why?

148
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,304
I'll find someone to send them to him later.

149
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,735
And you said there was no quarrel.

150
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,500
You made them for him yet don't want to deliver them.

151
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,373
I have something to do.

152
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll deliver these two.

153
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,072
They happen to be on my way.

154
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,063
I'm leaving.

155
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:26,296
Thank you.

156
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:28,729
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

157
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,200
Hello, this is your ice cream.

158
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,466
Xiao Ai, I'd never leave you.

159
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,466
I've just been really busy.

160
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,887
Didn't you say you'd come over?

161
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,422
Big Sister?

162
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,730
- Thank you, Big Sister.
- You're welcome.

163
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,941
Okay. Bye-bye.

164
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,050
Where are you going later?

165
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,178
I'm feeling sick.

166
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,178
I have a doctor's appointment.

167
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:06,139
Girls nowadays are too easily deceived.

168
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,787
No sense of who is lying.

169
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,875
Love is blind.

170
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,332
Who are you?

171
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:40,578
What do you mean?

172
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,978
I'm delivering your order. Here you are.

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,667
Here's your ice cream.

174
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,733
- Thank you.
- No problem.

175
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,600
I'd like to order a cappuccino.

176
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,133
Okay.

177
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:41,537
Hey, darling.

178
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,054
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,687
I'm late.

180
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:53,580
Actually, I was just at the hospital.

181
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,504
What's wrong with you?

182
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,448
Nothing much.

183
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:08,395
Just that when I see you, my heart beats very fast.

184
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,300
Don't be mad.

185
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,191
I really went to the hospital.

186
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,191
For your sake, I refused treatment and came right away.

187
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,807
All right, order something first.

188
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,399
I need to go to the bathroom. Be back soon.

189
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,666
Hello, Miss, where is Mr. Wang?

190
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,135
He went to the bathroom. You are…

191
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:42,066
Ah, I am his doctor, I sent him here just now.

192
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, sit here and wait then.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,664
Oh no, it's okay. I still have a few patients to see.

194
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,366
Uh… please remind him later to come and get his medicine.

195
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,033
I forgot to tell him just now.

196
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,200
Yeah, sure.

197
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,035
Ah, and you must advise him

198
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:57,939
to take care of his private life going forward.

199
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,900
This disease is very contagious.

200
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,680
What disease?

201
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't get into that.

202
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,811
Patient privacy, of course.

203
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,700
I believe Mr. Wang will definitely tell you.

204
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,731
I'll go now.

205
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
What did you order, darling?

206
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:25,020
You really went to the hospital today.

207
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,027
Of course. How could I lie to you?

208
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,111
Are you very sick?

209
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,078
Very serious.

210
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,100
…to take care of his private life going forward.

211
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,333
This disease is very contagious.

212
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,155
Jerk.

213
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,738
What's wrong?

214
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,389
What's happened!

215
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,000
♪ My lovely motorbike ♪

216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,982
♪ It never gets stuck in traffic ♪

217
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,200
Hey, Li Di.

218
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,500
Hey, De De, where are you? We're already here.

219
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,522
I'll be there soon.

220
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,334
Okay, okay! Hurry up.

221
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:55,020
Brother, I heard about your love story from Chen Feng.

222
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,500
But I don't think we know enough yet.

223
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,454
Give us a little more information.

224
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:01,332
Sure. I'll tell you guys again.

225
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:05,722
The first time I ever met her, was here on this street.

226
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,466
I was waiting for the bus.

227
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:09,000
The 5th Street bus.

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,466
Suddenly, there was this girl wearing a pink cloak

229
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,798
walking over and howling with laughter.

230
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,274
She drank too much and acted like a middle-aged man.

231
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:21,880
Then she came over and suddenly started strangling me.

232
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,829
She said, "I want to fly around with you, but I can't fly."

233
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,492
I discovered for the first time that girls have such great strength.

234
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,425
I couldn't break free.

235
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,468
We walked round and round in this park.

236
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,080
This is how we met.

237
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,135
I didn't know what was going on, but I fell in love with her.

238
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:39,286
We are preparing to get married now.

239
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,367
That's how we met.

240
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:45,933
Hearing your romantic story, I'm suddenly inspired.

241
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,555
All right, leave it to me. You guys go and play, I'll draw.

242
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,233
All right, we'll leave it to you then.

243
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,765
- We'll go play first.
- Go, go.

244
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:52,968
Draw slowly. Draw slowly.

245
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,068
Tiande, say cheese.

246
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,570
[Modern Sweet, Sweet Ice Cream]

247
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:18,607
Careful now.

248
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:20,333
And here's a spoon.

249
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,985
Thank you.

250
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,693
You're here again.

251
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:29,331
Unfortunately, she is not here.

252
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:30,997
Where did she go?

253
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:33,750
I don't know.

254
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:37,096
Given your connection, don't you know better than me?

255
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,807
What connection?

256
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,666
The whole making ice cream thing.

257
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,713
Exactly, it's just about ice cream.

258
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,908
She didn't deliver it to me today.

259
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,166
Call and ask her.

260
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,531
I'm not looking for her.

261
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:56,831
I'm here to buy ice cream.

262
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,440
Okay, which would you like? I'll make it for you.

263
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,073
- I want them all.
- Them all?

264
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,776
Are you sure?

265
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,462
Sure.

266
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,268
Can you do it alone?

267
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,451
I can't do it alone.

268
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,662
Hey, Mu Mu.

269
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:29,263
Hey? Tiande, come back quickly.

270
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:30,336
What's the matter?

271
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,800
We've got a huge order.

272
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,121
He wants all of our ice cream.

273
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,412
Who is that generous?

274
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,199
It's your…

275
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,768
Brother.

276
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:47,200
Oh… But I have something to do and I can't rush back.

277
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,933
Do as much as you can.

278
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,033
Okay, okay.

279
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:53,551
Yeah, goodbye.

280
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,060
Okay.

281
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,810
She's doing something and can't come back.

282
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,046
She said I can handle it, and asked me to do my best.

283
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:08,531
Do you think you still want them all?

284
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,473
Yes, I want everything.

285
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, that's all right.

286
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,195
Then you'll have to wait for a while.

287
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,480
I've paid. Take your time.

288
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,766
- Payment received: 1000 Yuan.
- Where shall I deliver it to then?

289
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,548
- No need.
- No need?

290
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,905
You're ordering it but not taking it?

291
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:33,970
You guys can quarrel away but why do I have to get dragged in?

292
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,048
Wow, Sister De De.

293
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:39,498
Your painting is extraordinarily good.

294
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,400
Of course.

295
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,766
Is my paint ready?

296
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,940
- It spilled.
- Spilled?

297
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,233
It's the only color I need and you spill it?

298
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,629
Hey, what are you doing?

299
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,782
Hello. We're helping a friend propose by drawing a picture here.

300
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:58,880
This is well done.

301
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,333
A marriage proposal you say?

302
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,900
When?

303
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,010
In these two days.

304
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,966
Don't forget to tell me when the time comes.

305
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,990
- I love to see young people propose.
- We will.

306
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,735
Hey, what were you arguing about?

307
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,055
- No more paint.
- No more paint?

308
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:17,433
I have paint! Come to my place and get some.

309
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,400
- Really?
- Come.

310
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,022
I'll go with Uncle to get some paint.

311
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:22,346
Great. Thank you!

312
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,532
Come in.

313
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:34,900
I have several pails of paint left over from something.

314
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,480
- Slowly.
- Thank you, Sir.

315
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,230
Don't spill, don't spill.

316
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,633
Should be enough for the project.

317
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,133
- Slowly, slowly.
- Thank you.

318
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,802
Is the girl your older sister?

319
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,733
Why would she be? Of course not.

320
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,907
Me and her…

321
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,091
we're very close friends.

322
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:58,076
It's just you look alike.

323
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,500
Remember. Tell me before the proposal.

324
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,757
Okay, no problem. Will do.

325
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:04,566
- Okay, be careful now.
- I'll be on my way.

326
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:06,648
Come, come!

327
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:09,012
I have some good news for everyone.

328
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:12,109
With Su Mu's hard work this week, the redesign was a success.

329
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:14,309
Zero deviation on the flight test.

00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,840
I decided we'll celebrate with a party tomorrow night.

331
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,266
Mr. Wang will be in charge.

332
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,334
No problem.

333
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,778
Okay, everyone, back to work.

334
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,962
Why do you look unhappy?

335
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,200
You've been under too much pressure lately.

336
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,101
Have fun at the party tomorrow.

337
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,210
My older sister…

338
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,400
What does he know?

339
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,026
He knows nothing.

340
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:53,233
And his vision is poor.

341
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,227
Any way you look at it,

342
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,033
I should be her older brother.

343
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,099
Her younger older brother.

344
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,900
Sister De De. The paint is here.

345
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,119
Okay, thank you.

346
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,954
Hi, Mom.

347
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,266
You're back?

348
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,033
So suddenly?

349
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:20,333
Okay, just wait a bit. I'll come to get you now.

350
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,033
Okay. Bye-bye.

351
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,872
What's wrong?

352
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:28,866
My parents are back suddenly. I have to pick them up now.

353
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,900
I have something on today, I have to leave first.

354
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
I'll accompany you then.

355
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,366
I'm driving today.

356
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:36,396
Sounds great. My phone just ran out of battery.

357
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,400
Let's go, let's go.

358
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,044
Hey, man, what do we do without you?

359
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,060
You guys…

360
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,537
Keep it up! I'll be back in a bit.

361
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,799
Thank you for your hard work.

362
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,133
Dates over family, huh? You're dead to me!

363
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,966
Wait for me, walk slower!

364
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:55,466
Everything else is pretty good, I just don't like the dessert too much.

365
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,000
Check if there's anything else available.

366
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
Have a look at this one.

367
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,200
This is good. Let's go with this.

368
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,654
Okay.

369
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,045
Wang Yanyi.

370
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,400
- What's the matter?
- Do me a favor.

371
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:15,533
Whoa.

372
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,733
God Su has asked for help. What's the matter?

373
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:23,010
What's the matter?

374
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,806
Welcome.

375
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,585
Hello, what would you like?

376
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,698
What is your "Ex-Boyfriend Yogurt"?

377
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:43,635
We sprinkle some herbs onto matcha ice cream.

378
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:45,685
Would you like to try it?

379
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,666
I'd like one "Knight in Shining Armor."

380
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,900
Okay, just a moment.

381
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:01,504
Is there another girl in your shop?

382
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,337
Yes. The boss' daughter.

383
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,483
No wonder.

384
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:07,576
No wonder what?

385
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:09,966
No wonder I always see you here alone.

386
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,075
So, you're the manager?

387
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,760
Yep. Here you are.

388
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,073
Wait.

389
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,066
I'm not just here for ice cream.

390
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,666
I'm here to talk to you.

391
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,708
To me?

392
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,154
Have a seat.

393
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:34,195
So, do you know Wei Lai Aviation across the way?

394
00:25:34,195 --> 00:25:36,282
I do.

395
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:39,041
I represent our company.

396
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,701
I'm looking for some dessert-makers to supply our party tomorrow.

397
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,533
We need cold drinks and desserts for around 200 people.

398
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:49,321
Your little shop… can you handle that?

399
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:53,766
I'm afraid we don't have enough staff for that.

400
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,887
Please consider it carefully.

401
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,633
Given what we're paying, it's worth your while.

402
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,822
It'll be an irresistible price.

403
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:05,002
It'll exceed a month's worth of profit.

404
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:08,973
If you decide to do it, come see me by tomorrow morning with all the desserts.

405
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:12,969
After tomorrow morning, we'll go to another shop.

406
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:14,657
All right.

407
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,000
I'll leave now.

408
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,793
Enjoy your day.

409
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,455
Oh, right.

410
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,385
Hope to see you tomorrow morning.

411
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,496
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

412
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,440
Thank you, Li Di.

413
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,107
It's okay, Auntie. I happened to be with Tian Tian.

414
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,680
Are you two together every day?

415
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,866
We are, we are.

416
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:25,392
A friend of ours is proposing to his girlfriend.

417
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:28,690
We've been planning it all together.

418
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,866
Very romantic.

419
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:32,888
Yeah, it's all Tian Tian's ideas.

420
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,700
Hey, she inherited this from her dad.

421
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,466
When he proposed to me back then, it was so romantic.

422
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:41,486
Was it? How did he propose?

423
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:45,266
My dad… set off firecrackers all up and down the street.

424
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,402
It was a line almost 100 meters long.

425
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:51,401
And after starting them, he ran down the line to my mom.

426
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,466
Why?

427
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:56,927
Stepping on the colorful clouds.

428
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,866
The old folk story.

429
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:03,200
By the time he got to her, he was all black like he had been in an explosion.

430
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,332
I found it so cute that I couldn't say no.

431
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:10,077
Uncle, hat was a brilliant tactic.

432
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:11,633
What brilliant tactic?

433
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:14,833
I risked my life to pursue love.

434
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:18,816
Enough, Mom and Dad, stop being so lovey-dovey.

435
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,925
Mom and Dad… Why did you come back so soon?

436
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:23,468
That's because…

437
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,800
Because I miss you.

438
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,193
You think I'm gullible?

439
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,393
Does my daughter believe it?

440
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:33,633
- Hey, darling.
- No, no…
- Hey, let me say it. I've got to tell her.

441
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:36,400
Do you remember the day your dad was drunk?

442
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,733
He wanted to surprise me secretly.

443
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,866
In the end, he ran to the bed in the next room.

444
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:45,469
He was taken for a pervert immediately.

445
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:47,533
In the end, your dad was wrapped in that bath towel,

446
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,512
being chased from the first floor to the fifth floor,

447
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:52,197
and from the fifth floor back to the first floor again.

448
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:55,833
It was a crazy scene, trust me.

449
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,666
Your father became the hotel celebrity.

450
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:03,033
He was too ashamed to stay there longer, so we returned.

451
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,098
Dad, you're really something.

452
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,793
Oh, come on, I was drunk.

453
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:08,904
- Li Di.
- Yes?

454
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:12,300
Watch your drinking in the future.

455
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,371
He's a total lightweight.

456
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:21,984
We're home.

457
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,621
Slowly, Mom.

458
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,732
Li Di, you must be tired.

459
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:39,933
It's okay.

460
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:42,435
Li Di, come over to have dinner later.

461
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,638
Your uncle will cook your favorite boiled beef.

462
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:47,505
My friends are all on the mountain and I have to pick them up.

463
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:48,833
Yes, yes.

464
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,400
- Maybe next time.
- Hurry up then.

465
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,902
I'll go first then.

466
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:53,500
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

467
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,712
- Drive safe.
- Be careful on the road.

468
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,677
Wait a minute. Don't forget about the proposal tomorrow.

469
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,780
We're home!

470
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,354
That guy… Do I know him?

471
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:29,140
That's enough. Let's go.

472
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,930
♫ In the season, I got to know you ♫

473
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,830
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

474
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,965
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

475
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,825
♫ Inadvertently ♫

476
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:54,460
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

477
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:01,959
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

478
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:08,319
♫ I can always protect you ♫

479
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:15,387
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

480
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:19,430
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

481
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:27,395
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

482
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,860
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

483
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:42,860
♫ That innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

484
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,681
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

485
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:57,523
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
