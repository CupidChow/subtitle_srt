What are you waiting for? Scan it.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,928
- Pardon?
- Scan your fingerprint.

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,014
Ah, my finger's like this, so I can't.

6
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,809
Hurry up and scan it.

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,480
What? Did you hurt your finger too?

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,232
Or…

9
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,901
is there another reason why you can't?

<i>Verified.</i>

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>The only lesson I learned</i>
<i>from battling my childhood illness…</i>

15
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,483
<i>is that there are some fights in life</i>
<i>you just can't win.</i>

16
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,573
Where are you going?

17
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,034
Dusonbong Peak.

18
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,454
<i>I also know…</i>

19
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,541
<i>that you always gain something</i>
<i>at the end of a fight.</i>

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,755
<i>But I didn't have the strength</i>
<i>to keep fighting until I won.</i>

21
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,092
You failed by just three points?
You'll definitely pass next time, Mi-rae.

22
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,138
I didn't pass either.

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,183
I made it to the second round
last time, though.

28
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,694
<i>Maybe that's why…</i>

29
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>I was so concerned about Su-yeon,</i>
<i>who was fighting for what was right…</i>

30
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,866
KIM SU-YEON

31

<i>…unlike me.</i>

32
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,702
Ms. Kim Su-yeon said…

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,245
<i>She lit up a small light</i>

34
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>that I didn't even know</i>
<i>existed inside of me.</i>

35
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>That light led me…</i>

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,377
It's all true.

37
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,255
<i>…to jump into a fight</i>
<i>I would've normally walked away from.</i>

38
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,635
<i>Exhausted from fighting a hopeless fight,</i>

39
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,389
<i>I grabbed hold</i>
<i>of the finger Mi-ji extended,</i>

40
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>and I ran away.</i>

41
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>And then…</i>

42
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,020
Is staying here an option, by any chance?

43
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,399
<i>…I unexpectedly found</i>
<i>another light in the place I had run to.</i>

44
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,650
Someone to take over?

45
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,360
I think he's going to the States

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,654
to start working again or something.

47
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>I felt ashamed</i>
<i>that I had tried to rely on that light,</i>

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>so I ran away again.</i>

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,826
Excuse me.

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,329
<i>I went back to the place</i>
<i>I had run away from.</i>

How would you like your hair?

54
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,224
I want hair extensions.

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,984
You didn't tell me you were coming.

56
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,903
You didn't answer my calls.

57
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,994
- What's going on?
- Well…

58
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,664
This is…

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,420
My name is Kim Tae-i,
a coworker of Ms. Yu.

60
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,476
You brought someone from work here?
Have you lost your mind?

61
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,312
I had no choice. It wasn't something
we could talk about outside.

62
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,856
Hey, why would you be talking
to someone from work about--

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,900
He's Kim Su-yeon's younger brother.

64
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,445
- What?
- You know, your senior coworker.

65
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,865
Tae-i is the younger brother
of that coworker who blew the whistle.

66
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,618
Why is Su-yeon's brother…

67
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,288
I thought that SY stood for Sang-yeong,

68
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,581
but it was Su-yeon.

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,251
He said he joined the company
to collect evidence for his sister.

70
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,212
He mentioned a guarantee or something.

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,548
Anyway, he's done collecting evidence,
so he said you need to make a decision.

72
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,717
- About what?
- Reporting the company.

73
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,553
You need to tell the world
what those jerks have been doing!

74
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,305
- Why would I do that?
- What?

75
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,141
- Because…
- Why are you dragging me into this?

76
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,726
Tell him to do that.

77
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,395
Tae-i said he can't do it
because he's not someone on the inside.

78
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,773
You're the one who saw
what happened to her from the start,

79
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,483
and you're the only one who testified.

80
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,984
He said only you can do this.

81
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,987
Why do I have to fight?

82
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,447
Hey.

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,241
Don't you think this is unfair?

84
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,077
The bad guys didn't even get punished,

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,621
while the person who spoke up
was bullied and then driven out.

86
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,748
You two are doing this
because you don't know better,

87
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,333
but this is a fight we can't win.

88
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,126
You won't know if you'll win or lose--

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,420
I already fought, and I lost.

90
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,713
I learned the hard way

91
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,841
that I'll be the only one suffering
if I fight them.

92
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,468
You want me to go through that again?
Why should I?

93
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,220
You said you're going to quit anyway.

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,847
But before you do,

95
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,225
you could at least teach
the people who bullied you a lesson.

96
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,685
Who said I'm quitting?

97
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,646
- I said I'd think about it.
- You're not quitting?

98
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,231
You're going to keep working there?

99
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,608
If you're staying,
then more reason to fight.

100
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,902
You're gonna go back to staring
at walls and wasting away?

101
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,697
Why do you keep running away
when you did nothing wrong?

102
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,867
- So what about you, Mi-ji?
- What?

103
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,787
Do you have some plan
to get your life together now?

104
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,747
Mi-rae.

105
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,417
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

106
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,796
Stop butting into my life
and focus on your own.

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,923
We're done pretending to be each other.

108
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,844
Fine.

109
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,930
Do whatever you want with your life.

110
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,778
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU

111
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,156
<i>I heard…</i>

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,617
that Su-yeon trained you.

113
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,170
I'm the one who trained Su-yeon.

114
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,053
I look forward to working with you.

115
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,096
Right…

116
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,354
Why'd you even bother…

117
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,813
BACK FROM PATERNITY LEAVE

118
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,358
Why not? She's part of the team.

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,525
Gosh.

120
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,027
Here you go.

121
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,237
Here's your latte,
and here's your Americano.

122
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,161
- Oh, I…
- I already had a cup earlier.

123
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,011
CHECK FOR ERRORS
SUBMIT THE EDITED FILE BY SUNDAY

124
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,846
These people are unbelievable.

125
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,349
You can't do this all by yourself.

126
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,185
Just leave it. I'll do it.

127
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,187
I'll help you.

128
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,481
That's what senior coworkers are for.

129
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,192
That's what senior coworkers are for.

130
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,153
Do the same
for your junior coworker in the future.

131
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,532
What?

132
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,409
Did I sound like an old geezer?

133
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,744
No.

134
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,288
Thank you.

135
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,334
Let's wrap this up quickly
and head home.

136
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,882
You really don't have to take me home.

137
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,343
Come on. We're headed
the same way, so hop in.

138
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,804
We worked late together,
so let me give you a ride.

139
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,398
PARK MI-RAE

140
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,235
My daughter's name is Mi-rae too.

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,073
I was pleasantly surprised
when I learned you two had the same name.

142
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,702
When I was on paternity leave,
I wanted to come to work so badly.

143
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,206
But now that I'm back in the office,
I miss my daughter so much.

144
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,342
Sir…

145
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,262
Here.

146
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,805
What's this?

147
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,100
A gift voucher for gas?

148
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,269
Gosh, it's okay. You don't have to.

149
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,729
Please take it.

150
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,940
I feel bad that you're always helping me
and giving me a ride.

151
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,818
Gosh…

152
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,071
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

153
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,742
I wasn't there
when you really needed help.

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,915
Okay, then…

155
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,668
When you buy your coffee in the morning,

156
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,546
bring one for me too, okay?

157
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,133
Okay.

158
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,885
MI-RAE! I LOVE YOU!

159
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,745
Hey.

160
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,705
Mi-ji.

161
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,773
Ma'am.

162
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,443
What brings you here at this hour?

163
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,699
I wanted to say goodbye
before going to work.

164
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,536
I'm dropping out of the new HQ project.

165
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,745
What?

166
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,373
Are you backing out because of me?
Because I said I'm not selling?

167
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,000
Gosh, of course not.

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,710
I just… Hold on.

169
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,087
You decided not to sell the restaurant?

170
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,923
I see. I'm really glad to hear that.

171
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,593
They're the ones in a hurry, not you.

172
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,262
Just take your time deciding.

173
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,309
Are you saying that
because you're not part of it now?

174
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,061
Who cares?
I'm out, so I can say whatever I want.

175
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,939
Gosh, that feels so good.

176
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,943
Why are you here to say goodbye, though?

177
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,279
Are you going somewhere far away?

178
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,489
No, it's not like that.

179
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,161
It just won't be easy for me
to come see you anymore.

180
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,538
So I wanted to say goodbye one last time.

181
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,169
You're kind of special to me.

182
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,965
I know I'm not
that special to you, though.

183
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,052
But looking back,

184
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,679
I realized
that ever since I came to Seoul,

185
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,850
you were the only person
who accepted me for who I am,

186
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:10,021
regardless of my job
or educational background.

187
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:17,737
To be honest, it's been a really long time
since I got to know someone new.

188
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,783
We may not be friends,

189
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,954
but you're kind of special to me.

190
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,546
Have you…

191
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,466
heard of an adult guardianship?

192
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,677
A guardianship?

193
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,516
I've never told you this before.

194
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,854
But I have a son.

195
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,023
You have a son?

196
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,068
He's been living in a facility
for a while now.

197
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,072
Because he's not of sound mind.

198
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:08,997
I need someone to look after him
if anything happens to me.

199
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,041
I'm sure you've noticed,

200
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,670
but I have no one around me
to ask for help.

201
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,548
If you're up for it,

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,384
I'll give you a bit of money
for the trouble,

203
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,261
so please think about it.

204
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,024
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

205
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,402
I'm sorry about yesterday.

206
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,864
I didn't know you had family coming.

207
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,577
Ms. Yu, can we talk for a moment?

208
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,913
Ms. Yu, you're not busy
right now, are you?

209
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,957
Come with me for a second.

210
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,130
May I go now?

211
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,924
Yes, you may go.

212
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,106
What's going on?

213
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,984
You said she was Mi-rae's twin,
but the prints match.

214
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,194
They matched?

215
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,576
Ms. Yu.

216
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,121
Can we talk?

217
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,332
No, I--

218
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,792
It won't take long.

219
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,127
There's something
I didn't tell you yesterday.

220
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
A few years ago,

221
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,553
my sister called me out of the blue.

222
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,392
She started talking about her company,
which I didn't know much about.

223
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,351
Re-do it.

224
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,104
<i>She said she was doing work</i>
<i>that wasn't her responsibility,</i>

225
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,940
<i>but her bosses kept making</i>
<i>unreasonable demands.</i>

226
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,942
<i>She was told to pressure</i>
<i>a third-party evaluator</i>

227
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,028
<i>into giving favorable results</i>
<i>for a specific company.</i>

228
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,113
And so she…

229
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,614
She blew the whistle.

230
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,034
Let's skip what we both know.

231
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,289
Over the past three years,

232
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,918
among the payment guarantees
provided by KFMC to midsize companies,

233
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,587
the Planning Strategy Team
oversaw 20 cases,

234
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,590
and 60% of them were focused
on a single company.

235
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,175
Sixty percent.

236
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,469
Can you believe it?

237
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,889
The company recently chosen
as the contractor for the new HQ

238
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,643
is that same company,
which is headed by our new CEO's relative.

239
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,397
The one that my sister supposedly gave
preferential treatment to "voluntarily."

240
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,356
Sihan Construction.

241
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,568
There's obviously something going on.

242
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,028
But no one's doing anything about it.

243
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,574
Someone has to raise the issue.

244
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,326
And that someone is me?

245
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,621
You already said all this yesterday.

246
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,790
You didn't hear about it from me, though.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,418
You showed up late.

248
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,594
You did seem strange lately.

249
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,390
The way you were acting recently
was so different from how you usually are.

250
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,145
I never would have imagined
that you had a twin.

251
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,313
So…

252
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,398
are you going to blackmail me?

253
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,153
The company would likely
be more intrigued by the younger brother

254
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,697
collecting company secrets
to avenge his sister

255
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,241
than by baseless rumors
about twins switching lives.

256
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,286
But you're not going to tell the company.

257
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
I don't plan on telling them either.

258
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,125
If the evidence is that solid,

259
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,169
then you can make a move yourself.

260
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,921
As you just said,

261
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,048
if I get involved,

262
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,050
everyone will focus more

263
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,386
on the younger brother seeking revenge
than on the real issue.

264
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,389
You're the only one
who can do this, Ms. Yu.

265
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,642
Why me, of all people?

266
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,311
You know how things are at work
for me right now.

267
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,438
You're the only one who testified.

268
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,232
The Planning Strategy Team?

269
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,567
They all saw it,
but they turned a blind eye.

270
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,444
They can't do anything
even if they wanted to

271
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,905
because everything they said
would become a lie.

272
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,659
This is a chance to prove
that you were right.

273
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,494
I don't want to prove anything.

274
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,707
I know it must have been hard
for you all this time, but…

275
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,708
No.

276
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,127
You don't know.

277
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,922
Do you know why those people bullied you?

278
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,758
They did that to hide their wrongdoing.

279
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
We should expose them
and have them face the consequences.

280
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,972
Don't you resent them for what they did?

281
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,432
I'm saying this
because I've been through it.

282
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,103
No matter how clear the evidence is,
it's useless if the company covers it up.

283
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,106
- It's a fight we can never win.
- We may lose, but…

284
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,359
But it's not right
to keep letting those guys win.

285
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,196
I don't care if we win or lose.
I don't want to fight anymore.

286
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,782
That's enough.

287
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,494
I'm sure Su-yeon doesn't want
her brother getting hurt either.

288
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,248
Why did you help my sister, then?

289
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,628
You didn't help her just so she could win.

290
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,089
You did it
because it was the right thing to do.

291
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,174
You're not like those cowards!

292
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>You're really amazing, Mi-rae.</i>

293
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,645
On behalf of all the cowards,

294
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,398
I want to apologize to you.

295
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,195
You're a very brave person, Mi-rae.

296
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,750
I'm brave?

297
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,963
I'm not.

298
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,886
I don't even have the courage
to be a coward.

299
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,305
Yes.

300
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,475
It was the right thing to do.

301
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,518
But…

302
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,522
if I had known…

303
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,194
that doing the right thing
would make things this hard…

304
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,949
then I never would've done it.

305
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,248
Why did I step forward?

306
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm nothing.

307
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,172
I should've just stayed out of it.

308
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,635
I keep thinking about it

309
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,262
and regretting it.

310
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,393
And I betray Su-yeon every night.

311
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,938
That's why…

312
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,317
with each passing day,

313
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,405
I hate myself more and more.

314
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,280
No, Director Yoon.

315
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,032
The offer is very tempting,
and I'm grateful.

316
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,871
But I still have quite a bit
to take care of here.

317
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,125
I'll decide within the week.

318
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,252
Yes, I'll contact you. Okay.

319
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,517
CALLS
DIRECTOR YOON

320
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,102
BUSINESS PARTNER

321
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,565
Where did my business partner go?

322
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,234
She left a while ago.

323
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,652
She left?

324
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,696
I told her you were looking
for your replacement,

325
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,991
and she bolted,
afraid that she'd get stuck with the farm.

326
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,576
Why did you tell her that?

327
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,121
I told you it wasn't confirmed yet.

328
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,835
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>

329
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,378
<i>has their phone turned off. Please--</i>

330
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,797
I NEED TALK TO YOU IN PERSON

331
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,091
<i>You said you needed to</i>
<i>tell me something. Why can't I reach you?</i>

332
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,301
<i>Did something happen?</i>

333
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,721
BUSINESS PARTNER

334
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,563
<i>I'll be in Seoul for a while.</i>
<i>I'll get in touch when I'm back.</i>

335
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,190
She's in Seoul right now?

336
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,150
This should be good enough, right?

337
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
Who are you texting?

338
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,613
The strawberry farm owner
we met that time.

339
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,200
We'll be working together from now on,
so I should keep in touch with him.

340
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,540
What will you two be doing?

341
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,416
Farm work.

342
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,961
I'll be taking over
from Mi-rae once I'm back.

343
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
I should get going now.

344
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,175
Go where?

345
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,426
Duson-ri.

346
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,680
I should go back since Mi-rae is here now.

347
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,349
- Why?
- What do you mean?

348
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,395
I'm done filling in for her,
so I should go and take back my place.

349
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,315
Now that you're done filling in for her,
it's no longer about whose place is where.

350
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,693
You can just stay wherever you want.

351
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,696
That is true, but…

352
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,658
I have nowhere to stay in Seoul,

353
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,578
and I can't stay at Mi-rae's
since we fought yesterday.

354
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,662
Then stay here.

355
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,331
What?

356
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,667
If you're going back
because you have nowhere to stay,

357
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,210
then sleep here.

358
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,006
But we…

359
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,925
Can… we…

360
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,385
do…

361
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,345
that?

362
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,931
Why not?

363
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,310
Don't confuse the toothpaste
with the cleansing foam.

364
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,687
There are more towels here,
so use them.

365
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,063
Okay.

366
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,858
What? You don't want to shower?

367
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,818
Of course, I should shower.

368
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,820
I should, for the sake of hygiene.

369
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,697
I'm going to shower.

370
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,740
Okay, then.

371
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,491
Shower.

372
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,035
Thanks.

373
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,749
I'm just sleeping over.
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

374
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,918
Just think of this place as a motel.
Wait. No!

375
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,336
Don't do that.

376
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,879
Yes?

377
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,631
I'll leave some clothes by the door.

378
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,593
My gosh, thank you.
The service here is great!

379
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,472
Stop overreacting. Seriously.

380
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,485
Are you going somewhere?

381
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,695
What? No.

382
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,325
- Are you done washing up?
- Yes.

383
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,619
Should I sleep here?

384
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,746
No, you sleep in my bed.
I'll sleep here.

385
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,457
You said you have
an interview tomorrow, though.

386
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,626
You should sleep comfortably in your bed.

387
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,422
Then whoever gets sleepy first
can take the bed.

388
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,424
Okay.

389
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,969
Your hair is still wet.

390
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,432
These are hair extensions,
so they get tangled without conditioner.

391
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,559
I'll just let it air dry.

392
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,604
That's right.
Your hair was a bit shorter before.

393
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,689
Yes.

394
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,858
- May I take a look?
- Sure.

395
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,907
This is so interesting.
So that's how they're attached.

396
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,327
Yes… I'm going to remove them all soon.

397
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,248
It's been a while
since I've had long hair.

398
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,419
It doesn't suit me, right?

399
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,130
You look pretty.

400
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,010
Your old hairstyle was pretty too.

401
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,680
It looked pretty even when it was shorter.

402
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,512
Hold on…

403
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,598
What are you thinking right now?

404
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,267
What am I thinking?

405
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,977
What do you mean?

406
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,022
Never mind.

407
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,691
Forget it. I'm sorry.

408
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,290
Why?

409
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
What are you thinking about?

410
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,586
What? I…

411
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,507
There's so much going through my mind
that I don't know where to begin.

412
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,841
Tell me everything.

413
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,054
Well… Am I being too clumsy?

414
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,973
Do I seem pathetic, doing this
when I've got nothing going for me?

415
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,102
I don't know how long
I'm supposed to hold my breath for.

416
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,647
And have I turned you off
and ruined the mood by saying all this?

417
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,693
Why am I even thinking
about this right now?

418
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,654
I must seriously have a problem.

419
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,405
I can't stop talking.

420
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,534
I wish I could be as relaxed as you are.

421
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,704
Mi-ji.

422
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,083
Should I tell you what I was thinking?

423
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,753
"Is she only staying

424
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,172
because I asked her to,
not because she wants to?"

425
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,217
"What's the latest we can leave
to catch the last bus to Duson-ri?"

426
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,803
"When would be the best time
to set up the bedding for her?"

427
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,764
"Should I sit on the couch or the floor?"

428
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,641
"If I wear short sleeves,

429
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,435
my scars will show,
so should I wear something on top?"

430
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,523
I put this on and took it off three times.

431
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,152
Jeez…

432
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,696
You're an idiot.

433
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,582
None of that bothers me at all.

434
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,428
You don't bother me, either.

435
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,933
No matter what you're thinking…

436
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,938
Regardless of whether
you can stop talking or not…

437
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,955
Did you see this?

438
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,457
- What is this? Wow.
- Is this for real?

439
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,959
If this is true, it'll be chaos.

440
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,336
It will be really disastrous.

441
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,724
Hey, Ms. Yu. Did you do it?

442
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,684
Pardon?

443
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,520
Did you upload that post
on the anonymous company forum?

444
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,356
What are you talking about?

445
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,322
Yes, sir. I just saw it.

446
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,074
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,288
WELCOME, MS. YU MI-RAE

SIHAN CONSTRUCTION
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

450
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,546
SIHAN CONSTRUCTION BECOMES
CONTRACTOR FOR KFMC'S NEW HQ

451
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,964
POST DELETED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR

452
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,059
How could you let an employee
post something like this on your watch?

453
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,394
I'm sorry, sir.

454
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,065
But we deleted the post right away,
and it was posted anonymously.

455
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,860
- So in terms of credibility--
- That's not the issue!

456
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:24,031
People will remember Sihan Construction,
thanks to this post!

457
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,617
What if the media catches wind of it
before we break ground on the new HQ?

458
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,495
I'll make sure that doesn't happen, sir.

459
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,206
We need to start construction
before this causes more talk.

460
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,750
How is the land acquisition going?

461
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,253
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Mr. Lee.</i>

462
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,089
You're sure that we'll be able
to buy Rosa Restaurant, right?

463
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,425
<i>You can never guarantee anything 100%.</i>

464
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,345
I'm doing my best to increase
our chances, so don't worry.

465
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,055
We don't have time for such…

466
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,020
I'll give you a month.

467
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,314
<i>If we can't buy it by then,</i>
<i>we won't wait anymore.</i>

468
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,027
What will you do then?

469
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,822
The company will use another law firm
for everything, not just this case.

470
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,242
<i>You know how much our company</i>
<i>pays Wongeun every year, right?</i>

471
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,120
Do you have the power to do that
as a director?

472
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,081
This isn't coming from me.

473
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,666
Our CEO ordered this.

474
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:21,213
<i>I'm not threatening you right now.</i>
<i>I'm begging you for your help.</i>

475
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,006
You make the impossible happen.

476
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,301
The fate of our new HQ is in your hands.

477
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,470
A month.

478
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,473
This means I need to make a risky move.

479
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,308
<i>Will you be okay with that?</i>

480
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,945
Why did you make that post?

481
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,823
You said you wanted no part in this,

482
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,741
so I made a move by myself.

483
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,289
So you thought making
an anonymous post was the best move?

484
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,083
It was deleted within a day.

485
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,002
Did you really think
you could fight the company like that?

486
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,755
Stop this before you get sued.

487
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,049
It has nothing to do with you.

488
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,511
It has nothing to do with me?

489
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,599
Haven't you noticed
that people think I wrote that post?

490
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,768
This is why I said I didn't want to fight.

491
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:20,439
People say, "We're in it together,"
but I still get blamed for everything.

492
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,191
It's not like you wrote the post yourself.

493
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,819
I'll be the one getting sued, so…

494
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
That…

495
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,532
doesn't matter to people.

496
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,870
Even if you get sued,
people will still suspect me

497
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,497
because they already think
I'm capable of doing that.

498
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,458
No one cares…

499
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,877
Sir!

500
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,296
Hey, Mi-rae. Over here.

501
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,506
No one cares about the truth.

502
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,757
Say hello.

503
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,219
This is my favorite
junior coworker from my team.

504
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,387
She's our ace.

505
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,680
Nice to meet you.

506
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,934
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

508
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,734
I was going to call a driver,

509
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,029
but I guess I was too drunk
and called you instead.

510
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,198
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,367
Why don't you hop in my car
since you're here anyway?

512
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,370
I'll just drive.

513
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,831
You?

514
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,585
I'm a good driver. I'll drive you home.

515
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,088
Okay. Let's go.

516
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,437
Sir, you should put on your seatbelt.

517
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,316
Sir?

518
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,787
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep…

519
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,331
What are you doing?

520
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,167
I thought you liked me too.

521
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,961
Pardon?

522
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,553
Wait, Mi-rae. I mean, Ms. Yu.

523
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,221
Wait. Stop.

524
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:21,893
I…

525
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:26,106
I admire you as a senior coworker.
I don't see you in that way.

526
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,193
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

527
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,154
I'm drunk, so I'm not thinking straight.

528
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,990
Damn it.

529
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,534
I must've lost my mind.

530
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,370
Just hit me once.

531
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,455
Yes, you know what?

532
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,417
Just hit me until you feel better.

533
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,627
Sir, please don't do this.

534
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,754
No, I…

535
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,423
What…

536
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,301
What should I do for you to forgive me?

537
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,344
I'll do whatever you want.

538
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's…

539
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,603
Let's just pretend this never happened.

540
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,479
What?

541
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,982
I said,

542
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,320
let's just pretend this never happened.

543
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,366
Are you… sure about that?

544
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,870
I don't want things to get weird
between us over this.

545
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,957
I just want us

546
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,210
to be good coworkers
like we have been until now.

547
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,546
Yes, right.

548
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,715
I understand. Let's do that.

549
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,052
Thank you. Thank you so much.

550
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,136
Thanks.

551
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,482
Ms.…

552
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,788
Ms. Yu.

553
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,167
Thank you, but please stop doing this.

554
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,045
I don't feel comfortable.

555
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,463
Pardon?

556
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,227
Sir, what is wrong with you?

557
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,562
Why are you acting like this?

558
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,272
I want to ask you that.

559
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,858
I think I'm acting
appropriately right now.

560
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,694
If you keep acting like this…

561
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,906
then people will think I'm being weird.

562
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,283
If this is because of what happened,

563
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,329
we agreed to forget about it
and carry on as usual.

564
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,081
Ms. Yu.

565
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,583
I'm a married man.

566
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,670
People are watching us.
Please don't cross the line.

567
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,297
I'd rather not meet privately
like this anymore, either.

568
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,031
Am I your first customer today?

569
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,535
That's right. You don't serve solo diners.

570
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,540
So…

571
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,751
Did you give it some thought?

572
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,256
If you don't feel comfortable
speaking one-on-one,

573
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,716
shall I ask Ho-su to come?

574
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,050
Why have you come back?

575
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,803
I told you I have no intention of selling.

576
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,847
I wanted to give you one last chance.

577
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,684
You're going to sell it anyway.
If you do it voluntarily,

578
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,811
then everyone will be happy.

579
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,273
Are you saying
you'll take it from me if I refuse?

580
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,529
That's what thugs do.

581
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,784
I will create circumstances…

582
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,328
that will force you to sell.

583
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,416
I will uncover secrets you want to hide,

584
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,460
expose them,

585
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,088
and determine whether you have
the right to the restaurant.

586
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,965
Gosh.

587
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,968
Let's stop before it gets that far.

588
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,181
That way, you can keep protecting
the things you've always protected.

589
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,976
Things like… your secret

590
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,481
or your son
at the Seonham Mental Nursing Home.

591
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,111
How did you find out about that?

592
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,530
Who knows?

593
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,449
Maybe there are many people around you
who are helping me.

594
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,245
<i>A guardianship?</i>

595
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,621
Here.

596
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,713
So…

597
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,426
I'll give you until tomorrow
to think about it.

598
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,274
Why are you so nervous?
It's not a formal interview.

599
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,192
You were recommended, right?

600
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,403
I don't know. I just have a bad feeling.

601
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,114
Should I have just said no?

602
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,992
I didn't think
you had moments like this too.

603
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,452
Let me.

604
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,086
You look decent now.

605
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,257
It's more crooked now.

606
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,058
Are you going to see Ms. Ro-sa today?

607
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,686
Yes, I should.

608
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,980
I'm supposed to give her
an answer by today.

609
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,648
What did you decide to do?

610
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,192
- Are you going to tell her the truth?
- Yes.

611
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,113
What if she gets really mad, though?

612
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,282
What if she calls the company

613
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,910
and reports me to the police,
and I end up in jail?

614
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,703
- And I--
- Don't go that far.

615
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,499
Don't be so worried.
Remember what I said.

616
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,627
There must be a reason

617
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,005
why she asked you for that favor
but couldn't ask me.

618
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,800
And you're telling her the truth
because you want to help her.

619
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:34,140
She let the lie
I told Ji-yun slide before,

620
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,603
so since I'm doing this to help,
she'll forgive me, right?

621
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,067
Your honesty is your best weapon, Mi-ji.

622
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,735
Right.

623
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,196
How do I look?

624
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,950
You look like…

625
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,327
someone who failed the interview already.

626
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,080
Hey, stop being so scared.

627
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,457
If they don't hire you, it's their loss.

628
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,127
Even if you don't get the job,
don't cry until you see me.

629
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,339
How many times are you going to tell me
that I'm going to fail?

630
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,591
Jeez. I'm trying to cheer you up.

631
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,303
Ho-su, you've got this!

632
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,263
You can do it! Go for it!

633
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,766
Yes.

634
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,399
I'm Bae Gi-cheol. Please have a seat.

635
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,956
I'm here, ma'am.

636
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,177
I…

637
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,266
I've thought about
the guardianship you mentioned.

638
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,060
But…

639
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,440
I want to be honest with you
about something first.

640
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,695
Go ahead.

641
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,697
I'm…

642
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,283
not Yu Mi-rae.

643
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,328
What?

644
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,039
I'm her twin.

645
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,626
Something happened,
so I was pretending to be her.

646
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,422
So what happened to the girl
who was here before?

647
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,258
That…

648
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,385
was me.

649
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,306
It was me all along,
from the first day I met you.

650
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,352
So?

651
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,065
Is that it?
You don't have anything else to tell me?

652
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,232
Pardon?

653
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,526
What…

654
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,654
Go.

655
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,658
Don't ever come back here again.

656
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,081
Ma'am, are you mad?

657
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,416
I just wanted to help…

658
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,585
Why help when there's nothing more
to dig up?

659
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,129
Did that lawyer tell you to do that?

660
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,006
Lawyer?

661
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,800
Which lawyer?

662
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,928
You're really gonna keep
acting clueless?

663
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,890
How would the lawyer have found out
where my son is, if it weren't for you?

664
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,978
Ma'am, it wasn't me.
I never mentioned that to anyone.

665
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,230
Then who did?

666
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,774
You're the only one I trusted
and mentioned it to.

667
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,487
Ma'am…

668
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,534
I'm such an idiot.

669
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,453
Even after going through it
all those years…

670
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,333
I had no one else to turn to,
so I trusted you…

671
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,460
You should go now.

672
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,672
Let's stop all these lies here and now.

673
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,049
Ma'am.

674
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,969
I swear I haven't lied
about anything else.

675
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,305
I meant everything I said and did
every time I saw you…

676
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,350
Ma'am.

677
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,106
I don't know you.

678
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,859
I don't even know who you are!

679
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,361
Get out right now!

680
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,399
Mi-ji, I think I did well.

681
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,902
- What do you mean?
- The interview.

682
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,363
I think I got the job. I'm having lunch
with the executives tomorrow.

683
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,656
Really?

684
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,951
See? I told you that you'd do well.

685
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,037
You're right. I was worried for nothing.

686
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,081
What about you? Did you tell her?

687
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,001
Of course, I did.

688
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,794
Really? What did she say?

689
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,839
She was very surprised,

690
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,008
but it turned out fine.

691
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,551
I'm glad.

692
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,055
We were both worried about today,
but things worked out for both of us.

693
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,642
When do you apply for guardianship?
Before you go to court--

694
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,852
Hey, that's not important right now.

695
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,687
You're employed again!

696
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,397
Let's have a party.

697
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,900
It's not even confirmed yet, though.
Let's celebrate tomorrow.

698
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,027
No, let's party today.

699
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,781
What do we need first for the party?

700
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,574
Let's buy a cake first.

701
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:47,620
We should get party poppers
and balloons too.

702
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,789
And party hats too.

703
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,211
I thought it was strange that she agreed
to back out of the project so easily.

704
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,838
I told you that Mi-rae
would cause problems.

705
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,675
But we don't know who made that post yet.

706
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,344
What other employee
would write a post like that?

707
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,473
We should've nipped it in the bud.

708
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,893
We put it off,
and now it's coming back to haunt us.

709
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,186
Hey.

710
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,063
Get rid of Mi-rae.

711
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,691
Pardon? But…

712
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,944
- How--
- You know how to handle her.

713
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,155
We've got to act now.
We don't have time to just sit around.

714
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,575
If this gets any messier…

715
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,578
won't you be in trouble too?

716
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,518
This is the evidence
I've collected until now.

717
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,771
Why are you giving this to me?
I told you that I'm staying out of this.

718
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,148
Just throw it away, then.

719
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,026
It's useless unless you use it, anyway.

720
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,417
Why do you keep running away
when you've done nothing wrong?

721
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,587
<i>I hadn't intended</i>
<i>to run away from the start.</i>

722
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,631
<i>I actually tried to just hang in there,</i>

723
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,721
<i>clinging to that faint belief</i>
<i>that at least I was in the right.</i>

724
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,607
Ms. Yu?

725
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,779
I used to work here.

726
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,615
You thought I wouldn't hear about
what you've been up to at the office?

727
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,117
How dare you seduce a married man!

728
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,827
Honey, what are you doing? Please stop.

729
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,705
Let go of me. You keep being too soft.

730
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,999
That's why she's not getting the message!

731
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,793
Come on. Please stop.

732
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,963
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

733
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,762
HUMAN RESOURCES

734
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,723
We're a public corporation,
so we have a responsibility

735
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,558
to maintain professional conduct.

736
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,811
We'll let this incident slide
with a warning.

737
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,104
But please stop making--

738
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,148
Why am I getting punished
when I'm the victim?

739
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:26,570
For assault cases, the parties
should settle the issue among themselves.

740
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,948
For a case like this,

741
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,409
you can't claim
that you're an innocent victim…

742
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,120
What kind of case is this?

743
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,162
Pardon?

744
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,753
It wasn't an affair.

745
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,756
It was sexual harassment.

746
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,717
I'm the victim.

747
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,598
Then why didn't you report it
as soon as the incident occurred?

748
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,605
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>a seed of doubt was planted inside me.</i>

749
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,649
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

750
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,777
At the time,
I didn't want to cause any trouble.

751
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,321
We spoke to members of your team.

752
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,908
They said that even after the incident,
you kept buying him coffee.

753
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:16,787
After an incident like that,
it's not normal to keep buying coffee

754
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,623
for someone who harassed you, is it?

755
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,419
At the time, I thought it was best
to maintain our relationship as usual--

756
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,670
But I heard

757
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,132
that you two worked overtime together
all the time,

758
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,050
and you carpooled too.

759
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,595
People also said
that you were more friendly with him

760
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,138
than with the others.

761
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,766
Are you sure you didn't have
a personal relationship with him?

762
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,855
<i>Did I really do nothing wrong?</i>

763
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,399
<i>Did I give him the wrong idea?</i>

764
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,029
<i>Did I really have no part</i>
<i>in how this all went down?</i>

765
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,240
Jeez, don't worry.
It's nothing to worry about.

766
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,575
Just relax.

767
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,620
She's just making a fool of herself.

768
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,748
Okay?

769
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,546
<i>Am I…</i>

770
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,257
<i>really the victim?</i>

771
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,467
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

772
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,558
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,481
<i>When the onslaught of questions started…</i>

774
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,278
<i>I had to run away.</i>

775
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,536
<i>I couldn't answer a single question.</i>

776
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,205
<i>Because more than anyone else,</i>

777
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,917
<i>I was doubting myself.</i>

778
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:05,771
CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB

779
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,369
<i>So what about you, Mi-ji?</i>

780
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,247
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

781
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,419
<i>I don't know you.</i>
<i>I don't even know who you are!</i>

782
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,535
Ho-su.

783
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,708
Yes, Mi-ji. What is it?

784
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,919
Your hair…

785
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,798
I think I should go.

786
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,218
Go where? At this hour?

787
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,095
Duson-ri.

788
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:25,100
Why the rush?
Did something happen back home?

789
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,063
Nothing's happened.

790
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,983
I just don't have a reason
to stay in Seoul anymore.

791
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,152
Of course you do.

792
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,238
You need to register as a guardian and…

793
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,865
I lied.

794
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,913
I couldn't even talk to her
about the guardianship.

795
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,501
Ms. Ro-sa…

796
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,129
got very…

797
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,842
very angry.

798
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,184
It was probably because she was shocked.

799
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,815
She said she doesn't know who I am now.

800
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,404
I don't know what I was expecting.

801
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,576
It all started with a lie
in the first place.

802
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,414
This all belongs to Mi-rae.

803
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,293
It was only possible because I was Mi-rae.

804
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,674
I want to go back to where I belong.

805
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,970
I have no reason to stay here anymore.

806
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,060
Mi-ji.

807
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,148
You belong where you choose to stay.

808
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,860
We can come up with a reason together.

809
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,574
I'd love to do that, but…

810
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,870
But for some reason,
I feel like I don't belong here.

811
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,374
I feel like there's no place
for me in Seoul.

812
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,468
Then let's go.

813
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,262
Let's leave as soon as the sun comes up.

814
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,723
Get some sleep until then, okay?

815
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,220
Mi-ji.

816
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,141
What are you doing?
Why aren't you going in?

817
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,601
Is the gate locked?

818
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,520
No, I just…

819
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:16,772
Are you okay?

820
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,899
Did you fight with your mom?

821
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,487
Gosh, I'm no match for her.
I can't even put up a fight.

822
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,906
I was just staring at the gate,

823
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,367
wondering if it's always looked
this worn-out.

824
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,954
Oh, that? If you repaint it,
it will look brand new in no time.

825
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:40,254
I guess I should repaint it sometime.
I'm going to keep living here anyway.

826
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,714
Well, have a good day.

827
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,216
Okay, see you.

828
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,342
Bye.

829
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,726
Mom, I'm home.

830
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,940
You're back early.
I thought you'd stay longer.

831
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,692
No, I just came back.

832
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,070
Mi-rae is at work anyway,
so what would I do by myself in Seoul?

833
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,948
Wow, there were so many people
that everything felt chaotic.

834
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,492
Why? Did something happen?

835
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,329
No, what would happen to me?

836
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,593
Did you go somewhere?

837
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:36,894
Seoul.

838
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,399
I'm feeling a little carsick
because I've not taken the bus in so long.

839
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,860
Mom, I'm going to go sleep.
Don't wake me up.

840
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,572
STRAWBERRY FARM

841
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,709
I'm sorry. I was in Seoul.
What should I start with?

842
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,340
I guess Mi-rae left?

843
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,514
Can I work instead of her?

844
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,727
Of course, you can. I hired you
because of your resume, Ms. Seoul.

845
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,523
My name is Mi-ji.

846
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,068
Mi-ji.

847
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,655
Mi-ji. The name's finally
starting to stick.

848
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,241
Let's go, Mi-ji.

849
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,451
Okay.

850
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,253
Ok-hui.

851
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,381
I heard you got hurt. Are you okay?

852
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,968
Did the kids switch places?

853
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,137
What?

854
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,806
Was Mi-ji actually Mi-rae this whole time?

855
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,224
Did you know about it?

856
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,564
- You did.
- Ok-hui.

857
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,107
Jeez, forget it. Whatever.

858
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,443
Ok-hui.

859
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,153
Don't…

860
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,614
Don't scold the kids too much.

861
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,033
Mom.

862
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,494
What do you all take me for?

863
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,460
Ok-hui…

864
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,549
Ok-hui…

865
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,765
I guess Mi-rae

866
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,185
has decided what to do,
considering she's back in Seoul.

867
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,480
I don't know. That's her business.

868
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,024
She doesn't tell me every single detail.

869
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,737
How does it feel to be back?

870
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:35,655
Crappy.

871
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,159
Then why did you return?
You could've just stayed in Seoul.

872
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,703
Because I felt even crappier
staying there.

873
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,830
I didn't do anything wrong,

874
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:47,501
but I felt uneasy for some reason.
I felt like I needed to come back.

875
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,295
I guess I'm just destined
to just live here forever.

876
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,799
Don't you feel a little like this?

877
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:57,094
Like a runaway teenager
bouncing around friends' places.

878
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,763
I know that feeling too.

879
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,849
I don't think you have any idea.

880
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,477
You studied abroad and lived in Seoul.

881
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,105
It doesn't matter
if it's the States or Seoul.

882
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,358
Anyone who's away from a place
they care about feels that way.

883
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,737
Do you still feel that way?

884
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,614
Not anymore.

885
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,075
The reason I cared
about the place is gone now.

886
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,453
Don't get the wrong idea.
I mean my grandfather, not Mi-rae.

887
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,790
I think this is a matter of the heart,
not destiny.

888
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,752
That's why I don't open up
to people very easily.

889
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,088
Because I might feel like
I've run away again.

890
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,054
A&A has been focusing

891
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:44,766
on barrier-free access
for the past few years.

892
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,602
And we're continuing to make improvements
to the office building.

893
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,397
Among major law firms,
we're also the most actively involved

894
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,232
in public interest cases.

895
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:57,529
You seem like the perfect person

896
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,574
to represent our company's goals, Mr. Lee.

897
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,619
Me?

898
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,289
Gosh, you two need to stop already.

899
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,084
I told them why you ended up
leaving Wongeun,

900
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,253
and I guess they were very impressed.

901
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,963
Of course we were.

902
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,465
You defied orders
and left Wongeun of all places

903
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:21,052
to protect the weaker party
and not the client. My gosh.

904
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,138
It's just like a movie.

905
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,556
Oh, that's--

906
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,101
Plus, I heard the senior lawyer
you clashed with was Mr. Lee Chung-gu.

907
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,979
I've heard so many rumors about him.

908
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,480
What's he actually like?

909
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,027
I tend to be a bit oblivious
when it comes to rumors--

910
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:41,323
He's famous for handling sensitive cases
while using his disability as a shield.

911
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,326
How can he be so cruel to the weak
when he's vulnerable too?

912
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,411
It's worse because
he actually knows what it's like.

913
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,539
He makes us look good in comparison,
so it works for us.

914
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,043
A senior and a junior lawyer,
both with disabilities,

915
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,045
making completely opposite choices.

916
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,255
It's a great story.

917
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:02,636
Sir.

918
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,516
Mr. Lee isn't like that.

919
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,229
He may use cheap methods sometimes,

920
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,981
but he doesn't use
his disability as a shield.

921
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:16,942
He's not like that.

922
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:20,403
- What those two were saying earlier--
- And…

923
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,115
I'm not like that, either.

924
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,579
I didn't step up to protect the weak.

925
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,874
I just couldn't ignore
a client's wrongdoing, so if anything,

926
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,752
I'm not fit to be a lawyer.

927
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,213
Justice, disability…

928
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:42,926
If you're looking for someone
to represent things like that,

929
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,430
then I don't think
I'm the right person for the job.

930
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,022
Then, uh,

931
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,359
if you don't represent things
like the vulnerable or justice,

932
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,237
what do you think you represent?

933
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,492
I don't think
I've ever really thought about that.

934
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,995
Then think about it,

935
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,832
and if you want to work for us, call me.

936
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,795
Come to think of it, it seems like
we were the ones being interviewed.

937
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,631
I should get going.

938
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,102
I'm back.

939
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,273
Mom, what are you doing here?

940
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,776
Come here. We need to talk.

941
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,030
I'm tired from work. Let's talk later.

942
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,072
Mi-ji.

943
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,242
Are you going to keep treating me
like an idiot?

944
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,580
I know you switched places with Mi-rae.

945
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,832
Were you ever going to tell me?

946
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,710
How could you be so brazen?

947
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,130
What were you thinking,
doing something like that?

948
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:05,133
It's nothing serious.
We just switched places briefly for fun.

949
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,301
For fun?

950
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,927
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

951
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,596
Why did you switch places?

952
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,015
Did something happen to Mi-rae?

953
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,560
Nothing happened to Mi-rae.

954
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,521
And I didn't ruin her life. Happy now?

955
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:21,524
Mi-rae is not the type
to go along with your plans

956
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,276
when everything is okay.

957
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,238
- What happened?
- Jeez, it's all over now!

958
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:31,201
You couldn't even tell us apart,
so why make such a big deal about it now?

959
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,536
What did you say?

960
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,624
Just because I can't tell you two apart,
it's okay to treat me like an idiot?

961
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,585
Do you even consider me family?

962
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,171
Your bedridden grandma knew about this,
so why didn't I?

963
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,341
Do you two even see me as your mom?

964
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,469
So what about you?
Do you see me as your daughter?

965
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,012
What?

966
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,139
You're always going on and on
about Mi-rae.

967
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,058
I'm your daughter too.

968
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,893
Why don't you ask if I'm okay?

969
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,355
You were nice to me at the hospital,
thinking I was Mi-rae.

970
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,399
Do you hate me now that you know it's me?

971
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,734
What in the world are you talking about?

972
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,444
You two are both my daughters--

973
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,154
We're not the same to you!

974
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,281
You can't even tell us apart.

975
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,575
What's so different
between me and Mi-rae?

976
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,953
I don't even expect to be treated
the same way.

977
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,705
Why can't you just look at me once
for a change?

978
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,374
Hey.

979
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,420
Do you think my mom was interested in me
when I was growing up?

980
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:27,382
This is all I learned growing up,
so what do you expect me to do?

981
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,759
How am I supposed to be a good mom?

982
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:33,263
I just can't figure it out,
so why don't you tell me?

983
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,057
You're a daughter too.

984
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,476
You may not know how to be a good mom,

985
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,728
but you must understand how I feel.

986
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:44,107
You kept waiting for Grandma
to notice you too.

987
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,401
What do you want me to do?

988
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,779
Should I stare at you all day?
Is that what you want?

989
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,323
Forget it. I can't talk to you
about anything.

990
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,784
Hey, what do you mean by that?

991
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:59,164
I'm asking because I don't know.
I'll do what you want me to do.

992
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,040
I said, forget it!

993
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:04,335
This is why I didn't want
to come back here.

994
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,671
Then you should've stayed in Seoul!
Why did you come back?

995
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,548
Because you're here by yourself.

996
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:13,845
If I leave, then you'll be left all alone
and you'll have to care for Grandma alone.

997
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,265
Hey.

998
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,977
Why would you worry about that?

999
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,938
I don't know. Jeez.
It's not like we have a good relationship…

1000
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,941
I'm annoyed too.

1001
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,819
I want to live freely too,
without thinking about things like that.

1002
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,779
But I can't help it, so I have no choice.

1003
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:36,075
Mi-ji, no one ever asked you
to worry about those things.

1004
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,662
I may not seem like a mom to you,

1005
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,665
but why would you worry
about things like that?

1006
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,875
Then who will?

1007
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,754
Who else would worry about that
besides me?

1008
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,215
I might suck at everything else,

1009
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,425
but being here is something I can do.

1010
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,511
Of course you can do other things.

1011
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:58,348
I told you countless times that
you're capable of everything and anything.

1012
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:04,020
Why do you keep trying to live like me?

1013
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:09,108
Why do you keep making me
a poor excuse for a mom?

1014
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,364
Why are you crying?

1015
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,242
You should go.

1016
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,954
Go wherever you want
and do whatever you want.

1017
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,999
I'll stay here,
so you should leave, Mi-ji.

1018
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,211
Why would you worry about those things

1019
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,088
and break my heart like this?

1020
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,756
Don't cry.

1021
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:36,678
Mom, I'm sorry. Please stop crying.

1022
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,639
I'm sorry.

1023
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,600
- Mom.
- Hurry up and go.

1024
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,143
I told you to go.

1025
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:50,191
Go wherever you want.
Don't worry about things here and just go.

1026
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,039
What is it this time?

1027
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:09,002
- How many times do I--
- Do you want to go see my sister?

1028
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,421
Right now.

1029
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,055
Are we…

1030
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,059
really going to go see Su-yeon right now?

1031
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,939
There's something
I didn't tell you earlier.

1032
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,192
You probably won't be able
to see my sister.

1033
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:35,320
Pardon?

1034
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:37,655
She's in her room.

1035
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,200
It's been about half a year
since she last left it.

1036
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:45,330
But she'll probably hear everything
you say if you talk outside her door.

1037
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,175
Su-yeon.

1038
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,302
Ms. Yu is here.

1039
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,973
I'll let you two talk.

1040
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,700
Su-yeon, it's me.

1041
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,661
Mi-rae.

1042
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,873
You came early.

1043
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,501
It's your first day of work.

1044
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,586
I'm Kim Su-yeon.

1045
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,924
Why are you here like this?

1046
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:42,261
You left, so you should've forgotten
about everything and moved on.

1047
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,347
Is it because you resent what happened?

1048
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,231
I came to tell you
that I can't help you this time.

1049
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,817
You know how it is.

1050
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,236
This is a fight we'll never win.

1051
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,615
To be honest, I don't even know
why I need to fight.

1052
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,326
I can barely take care of myself,

1053
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,496
so I'm not interested in punishing anyone.

1054
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,791
I'm scared and tired.

1055
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,503
You left because
you were scared and tired too.

1056
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,881
I get it, so…

1057
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,887
So please try to understand me
just this once.

1058
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,812
Your brother worked very hard.

1059
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,150
But I'm ruining everything.

1060
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,610
I'm sorry.

1061
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,407
No.

1062
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,747
Su-yeon?

1063
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,959
I'm the one who ruined everything.

1064
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,797
I'm so sorry, Mi-rae.

1065
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,091
Why…

1066
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,302
are you apologizing?

1067
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:06,971
I ran away by myself…

1068
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,479
even though I knew
how hard things would be for you.

1069
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,774
I'm just as bad as those people.

1070
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,986
That's why I'm so ashamed,

1071
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,655
and I'm sorry.

1072
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,282
But why are you sorry?

1073
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,327
Why are you apologizing?

1074
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,246
The people who should feel sorry
aren't even apologizing.

1075
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,165
No.

1076
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,625
It was my fault.

1077
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,211
What was your fault?

1078
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,671
You're a victim.

1079
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,216
You did the right thing,
so why are you here like this?

1080
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,761
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you here like this?

1081
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,544
You're back late.

1082
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,260
I thought you might have moved,

1083
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,720
but I guess you still live here.

1084
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,099
Why have you come all this way to see me?

1085
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,228
You kept avoiding me, so I had no choice.

1086
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,065
Can you spare me a few minutes?

1087
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,694
Say what you need to here.

1088
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,995
I'm sorry, but please move
to the Childal branch for a bit.

1089
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,998
The Childal branch? Why should I?

1090
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,416
What do you mean why?

1091
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,461
You pulled out of the new HQ project
without any warning.

1092
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,340
It's a high-profile project,

1093
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,635
so I guess the higher-ups
can't just let this slide.

1094
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,847
What are you talking about?
You said you'd take care of it.

1095
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,600
You said if I backed out of the project,

1096
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,810
you'd make sure I wouldn't be penalized.

1097
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,854
You told me this yourself.

1098
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,188
<i>But if you're not backing out…</i>

1099
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,940
PROMISED NO REPERCUSSIONS
REFER TO RECORDING

1100
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,401
<i>…because you're worried</i>
<i>about the repercussions,</i>

1101
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,029
<i>then I can take care of that for you.</i>

1102
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,283
That was before the post was made.

1103
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,704
You acted like you were going
to let this go quietly.

1104
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,497
Why did you make a post like that?

1105
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,249
I didn't upload that post.

1106
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,960
Ms. Yu. Do you expect me to believe that?

1107
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:48,591
Even if you didn't write it,
the higher-ups already think you did.

1108
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,720
And honestly, the company was ready
to take legal action,

1109
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,640
but I talked them out of it,
on the condition that you go to Childal.

1110
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:59,518
I'm not the reason
the company can't take legal action.

1111
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,606
You didn't learn
from what happened to Su-yeon.

1112
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,860
Don't pick a fight you can't win.
You're only going to get hurt.

1113
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,695
Move to the Childal branch for now.

1114
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,366
I'll help you come back
once things quiet down.

1115
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,661
By that time, I'll be a team leader.

1116
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,163
And I'll have the power
to transfer you back to HQ.

1117
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,500
This is just like last time.

1118
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,459
What?

1119
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,170
The day you tried to kiss me,

1120
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,591
you got down on your knees and begged me
to forgive you when we were alone.

1121
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:34,261
Then you suddenly acted like
you were the victim in front of others.

1122
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:37,056
Do you really think
I'll fall for the same trick twice?

1123
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,562
Let go! Let go of it!

1124
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,523
Let go! Give me that!

1125
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:47,984
DON'T SAVE

1126
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:48,985
Hey!

1127
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,153
Damn it.

1128
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,656
Mi-rae, why are you so naive?

1129
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,908
Let go! Give me that!

1130
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:57,743
Damn it.

1131
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,747
You can do this crap all you want,
but no one will believe you.

1132
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,792
This isn't like some kind
of truth-telling game.

1133
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,086
It's basically a battle of reputations.

1134
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,213
- Let go!
- You still don't get it?

1135
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,884
No matter what you try to do,
no one is on your side.

1136
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:18,723
No matter what I do, you'll end up
getting blamed for everything.

1137
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,645
No, I did nothing wrong.

1138
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:25,730
Damn it.

1139
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,691
Hey!

1140
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,401
You jerk!

1141
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,903
Darn it.

1142
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,948
You bastard! Because of you, I…

1143
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,243
- Mi-ji! Hey, Mi-ji!
- Because of you, Mi-rae…

1144
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,786
You jerk!

1145
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,664
Damn it.

1146
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,709
Hey, are you okay? Wait.

1147
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,586
- Why, you little!
- Hey…

1148
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,254
Hey, hit him a little more.

1149
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:52,757
You really…

1150
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,759
No one's coming.

1151
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,094
PEOPLE'S POLICE

1152
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:01,974
Hey, Ho-su.

1153
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,895
I'm the perpetrator's lawyer.
Is it okay if I sit in?

1154
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,357
Does having a lawyer show up
change the fact that you assaulted me?

1155
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,234
I refuse to settle.

1156
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,321
Mr. Park Sang-yeong was previously accused

1157
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,282
of sexual harassment against
Ms. Yu Mi-rae within their company.

1158
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,410
That same individual came to her house,
grabbed her wrist, and threatened her.

1159
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,662
So shouldn't this
be considered a rescue instead?

1160
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:24,955
Hey, look.

1161
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:36,133
I believe Ms. Yu Mi-ji's action
was a lawful and justified act.

1162
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,553
Is it true that you were accused?

1163
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:43,557
No, that was just a false accusation.

1164
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,893
She accused an innocent person
of sexual harassment,

1165
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:48,896
but she couldn't even follow through
and dropped it midway.

1166
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,898
Is that true?

1167
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,983
This time, I won't drop the charges.

1168
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:58,072
I want to press charges against Mr. Park
for sexual harassment and defamation.

1169
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,454
<i>The void left behind by my self-doubt</i>

1170
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,873
<i>began to fill with courage.</i>

1171
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,839
Why does it feel
like I've run away from home again?

1172

1180
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,507
So that's what you decided to do.

1181
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:01,177
Okay, I understand.
Well, we'll meet again somewhere else.

I'm going to send an email right now.
