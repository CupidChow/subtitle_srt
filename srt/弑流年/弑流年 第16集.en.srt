1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey!

2
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,280
Don't be afraid, Rui.

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,080
No matter how fierce those people look,

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,560
they can't hurt us, right?

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Luan, let's go.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
I want to leave this place

7
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,320
with you and Mother, just the three of us.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,610
Where would you like to go, Rui?

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,400
Mother told me

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,560
her hometown is in Weizhou.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,330
It has the bluest skies in the Tang Dynasty

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,920
and sheep as white as snow.

13
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,360
Alright, be good, Rui.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,970
Get some more sleep.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,480
When you wake up, we'll set off for Weizhou together.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,960
Okay?

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,130
So you're saying

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,570
they're using your son to force you

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,050
to do their bidding?

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,840
So

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,890
you've been Wei Cheng's person all along.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,720
I have nothing left now.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,690
I'm begging you to find a way

24
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,490
to save them.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,000
I know

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
you two are not ordinary people.

27
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,400
Nongyu.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Haven't you always been saving others?

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Please find a way to save them too, will you?

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,480
I...

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm kowtowing to you.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Please save them.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,420
Don't kneel, please don't kneel.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,960
It seems now

35
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,720
there's only one solution left.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Master.

37
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,920
Nongyu.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
These past two days,

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,800
you've been treating our family's illness

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,690
and also tending to that person's wounds in the dungeon.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,450
You've really worked hard.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Let me ask you,

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,800
is there any medicine in this world

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,360
that when taken

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,160
can make someone tell the truth?

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
Master, you must be joking.

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,579
How could such medicine exist in this world?

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,000
However,

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,650
are you troubled by that criminal?

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Could it be

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,480
you have some method?

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,560
Your official matters,

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,360
I dare not speak carelessly about.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,420
Feel free to speak.

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,480
I...

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
I just feel that

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,960
that criminal now only wishes to die

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,980
so he can leave his name in the history books.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,960
Eager to die?

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
Dream on.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,940
I just remembered something.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,090
There was this situation back in my hometown.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
The village butcher,

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,040
his wife was a real shrew.

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,040
Relying on her wealthy family background,

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,100
she would either beat or scold the butcher all day long.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,890
One time things got really bad,

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,160
she stomped her foot and went back to her parents' home.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Guess what happened?

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,420
Don't keep us in suspense.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,440
Her family not only refused to help her,

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
they scolded her for not being a proper wife,

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
gave her a severe beating,

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,570
and sent her right back.

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
From then on, that woman

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
became as obedient as could possibly be.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Nongyu, oh Nongyu,

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,360
you really are my clever little darling.

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
Useless fool!

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,500
You failed your mission and still have the nerve to face me?

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
This Li Ling is extremely cautious.

82
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
I wanted to make a move,

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
but I needed an opportunity.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,080
I...

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,370
I have something else to report to you.

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,880
What's this?

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,240
It's a pass token for the Chen mansion.

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,770
I had a hard time getting it.

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,480
Right now, everyone in the Chen mansion

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
is busy dealing with the spy matter.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
The old eunuch's attention

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,620
isn't focused on this either.

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,300
If we want to steal the map,

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,440
now is the perfect opportunity.

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
If we get the map,

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,240
it would be a great achievement.

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
Manager Wang, your future would be limitless.

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,210
Do you think I'm stupid?

99
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,200
That Zhaixing Hall is full of traps.

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
Even if I can enter the Chen mansion,

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,540
I still can't get into Zhaixing Hall.

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
So what use is this thing?

103
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,240
People coming and going from the hall

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,900
makes it truly inconvenient.

105
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,440
But when they need to use it,

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
they'll definitely take it out.

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,360
Yesterday, on the desk in Chen Jingbian's study,

108
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,920
I saw a curious small wooden box.

109
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,090
I guarantee you,

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
that must be the Night Firefly Map.

111
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,720
Really?

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,330
The fish has taken the bait.

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,850
I'm not certain.

114
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,720
But to kill two birds with one stone,

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,980
I have to take the risk.

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
But this plan involves more than just you and me.

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
There's also Pang Shiyuan.

118
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,090
You trust her that much?

119
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,740
Have you ever heard her play the xiao?

120
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,780
I didn't know Officer Li appreciated music.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,840
What I mean is,

122
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,000
I never understood before

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,260
where the sadness in her music came from.

124
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,810
Until I heard her talk about her child.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,940
I trust her.

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,160
And I trust you even more.

127
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,380
Your wounds are healing well.

128
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,130
Take good care of yourself.

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,780
I'll go get your medicine.

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,980
Come. Dinner's ready.

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,240
Hurry up.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,170
It's time to eat.

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
We're here to rescue you.

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Prison break!

135
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,380
Hurry! Someone come quickly!

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,159
Looks like he doesn't have many days left.

137
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,920
Neither of us can escape if we carry him.

138
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Sorry, young man.

139
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
The orders from above were clear.

140
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
If we can't rescue you, we leave no body behind.

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
He's not dead.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
You want to be a hero.

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
But they've tossed you aside like an old shoe.

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,440
You've suffered so much physical pain for nothing.

145
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,320
Even I feel sorry for you.

146
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,600
Boy.

147
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,560
I can see you're a man with spirit.

148
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,440
If you just cooperate,

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
wealth and glory

150
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
will all be yours.

151
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,420
Nice performance.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
We'll come to rescue you.

153
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't fall for it.

154
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,520
But I could smell your fox stench

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
from a mile away.

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,370
You dare bite me?

157
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,440
I'll kill you!

158
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,970
Not good.

159
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
It's Zhaixing Hall.

160
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,660
It's the study.

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Go.

162
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Damn it.

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
This way, this way.

164
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,520
Over here.

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,250
That way.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Hurry up.

167
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Seal all the doors.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
The rest of you follow me.

169
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,720
Yes.

170
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,679
Take this.

171
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,440
Why aren't you taking it?

172
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,240
Officer Li, we couldn't find them.

173
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,900
Officer Li.

174
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,440
Nothing here.

175
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,690
All of you go search over there.

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,660
Did you catch them?

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
If Manager Xie couldn't catch them,

178
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,060
how could I possibly do it?

179
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Useless fool.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,960
Come with me.

181
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,440
Yes.

182
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,210
Take this first.

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you giving me this?

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How can you run while holding this?

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
Take it for now.

186
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
Find a chance to give it to Lord Wei later.

187
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,560
I...

188
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,360
You...

189
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,080
They've searched every corner of the mansion.

190
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
Could they have grown wings and flown away?

191
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,290
One manager and one attendant.

192
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
What use are you all to me?

193
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,740
It's my incompetence.

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,300
I've failed you, Sir Chen.

195
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,080
Officer Li.

196
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,410
Don't be so quick to apologize.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
When the thief was stealing,

198
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,040
the master and I were interrogating prisoners in jail.

199
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,840
Only you

200
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,780
were patrolling outside.

201
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,040
If you hadn't neglected your duties and missed the opportunity,

202
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,720
how could that thief have escaped?

203
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,450
Manager Jie, you're mistaken.

204
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,000
When the thief triggered the alarm in the study,

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,360
I immediately sealed off all the gates.

206
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
Even with divine powers, he couldn't have escaped.

207
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,120
But you, Manager Jie,

208
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,800
immediately withdrew all the secret guards.

209
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,900
The thief was clearly still inside the mansion,

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,020
yet you created such a big commotion.

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,220
And the result?

212
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Did you catch anyone?

213
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
Nonsense.

214
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,000
You.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,530
Silence, all of you!

216
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,360
Officer Li.

217
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,050
Stand up.

218
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,080
Get up.

219
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,260
Thank you, master.

220
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
I have important news to report.

221
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,850
What are you doing here?

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,540
Master.

223
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,050
I saw someone coming from the study

224
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,920
stealing a box and running away.

225
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,450
What did you say?

226
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,740
Was it Pang Shiyuan who stole the box?

227
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,450
Did you see clearly?

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,560
I saw clearly it was Miss Pang.

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,580
I never thought

230
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,740
I was harboring such an ungrateful wretch in my household.

231
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,020
I also heard...

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,700
I overheard Miss Pang and that thief discussing

233
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
plans to give the box to Wei Cheng.

234
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,600
I understand now.

235
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
That thief must have

236
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,840
mistaken the study for the Star-Picking Hall

237
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,100
thinking they got the Night Firefly Map.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
This Wei Cheng,

239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,360
how dare he oppose me.

240
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,370
I will never let him get away with this.

241
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,500
Master.

242
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,060
Wei Cheng is too arrogant.

243
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,500
He's not only my enemy,

244
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,650
but now he's plotting against you too.

245
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Wei Cheng cannot be allowed to live.

246
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,320
I have a plan.

247
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,120
Speak.

248
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Since childhood, I loved eating cherry pastries.

249
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
My mother spoiled me

250
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,060
and often made them for me.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,600
But the neighbor's children

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
would often come and steal them.

253
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,520
So I put

254
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
a handful of croton powder in the cherry filling.

255
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,060
Whoever stole them after that got diarrhea.

256
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,960
The more they stole,

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,360
the worse they suffered.

258
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,560
You're comparing this box to cherry pastries,

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,520
suggesting I set a poisonous trap in the box to kill Wei Cheng.

260
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,840
After it's done, we can frame the Li Tang dynasty.

261
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
This plan is truly flawless,

262
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
perfect in every way!

263
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,820
You're so brilliant, master.

264
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,090
I merely offered a simple suggestion.

265
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,980
Indeed,

266
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Master Chen has an excellent strategy.

267
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,480
