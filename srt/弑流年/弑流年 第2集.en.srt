1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey!

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,520
Father!

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,760
Hurry up!

4
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,840
Chang'an, here I come!

5
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,600
Go!

6
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,520
Hurry!

7
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
Those who collude with Tang forces will be executed.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,800
Those who flee from battle will be executed.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,680
Those who disobey military orders will be executed.

10
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,610
Don't you see, the road to Chang'an

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,360
Ages us each time we return.

12
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,240
From now on, Chang'an is no longer home.

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Home bids farewell to Chang'an forever.

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Sir,

15
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,380
how is the divination?

16
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,610
Fire trigram. It indicates change

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
and good fortune from the west.

18
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,890
This is a good sign, sir.

19
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,960
There must be happy news coming.

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,720
Report!

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Sir!

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,600
Sir!

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,380
Official Li has returned.

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,520
We caught the thief.

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,079
It's not a thief.

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,880
It's a woman.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
A woman?

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,079
It hurts.

29
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,610
It hurts.

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,760
What?

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
Now you know what pain feels like?

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
I have to tie you up like a criminal

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,410
so I can take you to see Master Chen.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,760
I said you could tie me up,

35
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,320
but I didn't say you could tie me this tight.

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,480
If I don't tie you up tightly,

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,280
what if

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,060
you try to assassinate

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,720
Master Chen when you see him?

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,290
Let's go.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Li Ling.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
I told you to catch a thief,

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,340
why did you bring back a woman?

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,840
This young lady's identity is suspicious.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,170
Blood stains were found at her residence.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Madam,

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,850
I've been wrongfully accused!

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
I am a physician

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
who runs a clinic in Huaiyuan District.

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,480
Patients come and go every day,

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,050
and some inevitably bleed from their wounds.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
There's a war outside the city.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Those wounded soldiers

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,890
often come to me for treatment.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,440
It's unavoidable to have bloodstains inside and outside my place.

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,120
I certainly haven't

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
done anything terrible!

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,680
[Pleading]

59
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,280
If you don't believe me,

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
you can investigate!

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
I truly am innocent.

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,760
This Officer Li refused to believe me.

63
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,840
He simply wouldn't listen.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
He used force

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,650
and brought me here tied up.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
I was frightened half to death!

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Speak.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
What's your name?

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,160
Where are you from?

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,020
Tell the truth.

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
My name is Nongyu,

72
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,300
I'm from Shanzhou.

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
I've studied medicine since childhood

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,399
and traveled throughout the Western Regions.

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,460
I just arrived in Chang'an recently.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,740
From the west, huh?

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
You, a mere woman,

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,290
You really are a doctor.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
If you don't believe me, I can prove myself.

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,780
The medicinal fragrance in this room...

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
has the scent of Chuanxiong and Zhuyu.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
These two herbs

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,330
are often used to treat headaches.

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,240
I dare to guess

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,640
that you suffer from headaches.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,170
Do you experience insomnia and night sweats?

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
How did you know that?

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,760
This prescription may relieve headaches,

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
but it cannot cure the root cause.

90
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,880
If used for too long,

91
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,140
it will harm your body.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,610
So you're saying

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,370
you have a better solution?

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,690
I dare to take your pulse, Sir Chen.

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,730
Sir Chen,

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,570
you absolutely cannot!

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,360
This woman's background is unknown.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
It could be dangerous to let her get close.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Officer Li, why would you say such things?

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,720
How could anyone dare to harm someone of Sir Chen's status?

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
I don't need to get close.

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,640
I can still take your pulse from a distance.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
Is that true?

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,080
How extraordinary!

105
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,159
Years ago in the palace, I only saw once

106
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,300
when Master Yun diagnosed the Imperial Consort using suspended thread pulse-taking.

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
I already understand your condition, sir.

108
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll prepare the medicine for you right away.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,640
Li Ling

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,380
is here.

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Assist me

112
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
and make no mistakes.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,610
Your medicine better work.

115
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,820
Otherwise, in this Huaiyuan clinic,

116
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
there will be no more female doctor.

117
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Come take a look!

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,780
Take a look!

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,800
Li Ling is here.

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,920
Are you two gentlemen here to buy medicine?

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,730
Is this pharmacy suitable?

122
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,560
It's arranged by Officer Li.

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,410
Please come in, gentlemen.

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,530
Come.

125
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,000
Quickly prepare the medicine according to this prescription.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,640
All right.

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Waiter!

128
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Bring tea for our guests quickly!

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,200
Right away!

130
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,320
Your tea, sir.

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,040
Sir,

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,040
there are two sets of medicine on this prescription.

133
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
I need to go to the back

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
to fetch them.

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,040
Your medicine isn't fake, is it?

136
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
If you don't trust me,

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,440
you can follow me to the back room

138
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,080
and inspect it yourself.

139
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Very well.

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Wait a moment.

141
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,760
This is your young friend's prescription.

142
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,000
Since we're already here,

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,460
let's get this filled too.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,760
Don't worry.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,260
As long as I keep quiet,

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,040
no one will know.

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,500
Officer Li, you're using public resources for personal gain.

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Excellent tea!

149
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,780
No wonder you're in Master Chen's favor.

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm like someone walking at night with a bald man,

151
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,179
benefiting from the reflection.

152
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,970
What did you say?

153
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,330
A-Qi is with her?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,130
How did this happen?

155
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,280
The city gates are all sealed now.

156
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,240
The streets are full of secret guards.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
And A-Qi urgently needs treatment.

158
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,800
Even if we wanted to move, we couldn't.

159
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
What exactly does she want to do?

160
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,260
She didn't say.

161
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,160
She only mentioned going into the Chen residence.

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Is it ready, Officer Li?

163
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
The medicine is ready.

164
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,480
I need to take it back to the pharmacy to brew it.

165
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,520
After it's brewed, I'll have to deliver it again.

166
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,250
Mr. Chen's medicine cannot be taken carelessly.

167
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,770
Could it be Chen Jingbian's enemy?

168
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
Using medicine as an excuse to kill him?

169
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
We haven't obtained the Night Firefly Map yet.

170
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Chen Jingbian absolutely cannot come to harm.

171
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,180
I know that, of course.

172
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
But for now,

173
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
we can only take it one step at a time.

174
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,000
All right.

175
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Come.

176
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Take care.

177
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,840
Let me.

178
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll do it.

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
It's so bitter!

180
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
What did you give him?

181
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,040
Five-Poison Death Pill.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,200
You...

183
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,240
It's sugar-preserved plum.

184
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
It's so sweet.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
Thank you, Sister Yu.

186
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
No need to thank me.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,860
Tell that Ling of yours

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
to stop glaring at me.

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,800
Let's go.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,460
I need to deliver medicine to Mr. Chen later.

191
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,740
You should rest first.

192
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,600
Sweet.

193
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,700
Master.

194
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,600
Dr. Yu's medicine is ready.

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
I've tested it with a silver needle.

196
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,940
It's not poisoned.

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Tell me the truth.

198
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,220
Did you tamper with the medicine?

199
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,740
Master!

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,220
What's wrong, Master?

201
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,490
Are you alright?

202
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Master!
