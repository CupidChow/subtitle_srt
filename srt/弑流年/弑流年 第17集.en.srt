1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
The person has been brought.

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,780
We've got the item.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,490
Give it to me.

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,980
Master.

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,810
With this thing,

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,520
all of Chang'an will be ours.

8
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,810
Be careful of traps.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Let me.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,360
All right.

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,380
The Night Firefly Map.

12
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,600
You were sent by that old eunuch.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,260
Chen Jingbian wants you dead,

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
but I'm here today for the Great Tang.

15
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,160
You...

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,300
You're working for the Li family.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,200
Wei Cheng,

18
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,400
you betrayed your master and colluded with Great Yan

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
bringing disaster to the country and its people.

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,880
This is high treason.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,770
By order of His Majesty,

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,800
today

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,010
I've come to execute the Wei family traitors.

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
Fire!

25
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
Put out the fire, quick!

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,240
Help!

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,960
Fire!

28
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,720
There's a fire!

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,980
Someone come quickly!

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Hurry up and put out the fire!

31
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,120
Minister Wei is a pillar of our Great Yan.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,290
We absolutely cannot let anything happen to him.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,320
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
My wish has been fulfilled.

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
Thank you, Lord Chen.

36
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,160
The mouth of a bamboo snake,

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
the sting of a wasp's tail,

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,680
neither compares to your clever mind.

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,200
Nongyu, oh Nongyu.

40
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Fortunately, you're my person.

41
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
This is as far as I'll go with you.

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
Hurry and leave the city.

43
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Keep heading east,

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,240
and you'll find the Tang army stationed in Xianyang Village.

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,700
Rui'er,

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
come kneel with me

47
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
to thank our savior.

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,100
Please don't. Get up quickly.

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
Actually,

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,930
I have a favor to ask.

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,159
Please speak, Officer Li.

52
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,680
These are the Chang'an defense maps

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,760
and troop deployment orders from Wei Cheng's residence.

54
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,800
Please make sure

55
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,159
to deliver them to the Tang army in Xianyang Village.

56
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,320
The liberation of Chang'an will soon follow.

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,920
Even if it costs us our lives,

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,460
we will deliver these items to the Tang army.

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,720
I, Li Ling,

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
on behalf of the people of Chang'an,

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,360
thank you both.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,380
Go quickly now.

63
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,420
Officer Li,

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,410
Shiyuan has something to tell you.

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,020
In this chaotic world,

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,850
to meet among countless others

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,500
is already a blessing.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,360
You and Nongyu are a perfect match.

69
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
Don't forget each other.

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,520
Rui.

71
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,920
This is too valuable.

72
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I can't accept it.

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
Nongyu, if you don't take it,

74
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,159
I really don't know how to thank you.

75
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,400
You know Shiyuan is a common person,

76
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,690
and everything I have is ordinary.

77
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,610
But look,

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,060
this has twin lotus flowers on it,

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
symbolizing hearts beating as one,

80
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,010
flying wing to wing.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Tell me,

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
what woman in this world doesn't wish

83
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
to have a man who would go through fire and water for her,

84
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
without any hesitation?

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,180
Speaking of this, I'm actually a bit envious of you.

86
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,850
If you truly have feelings for him,

87
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
then wear it.

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
Consider it my blessing to you both.

89
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,820
About tomorrow's matter,

90
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,340
whether we succeed or not,

91
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,560
we probably won't see each other again.

92
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,850
We will definitely meet again.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,930
This battle involves not just you,

94
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,480
but me,

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,580
and Li Ling too.

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
For Rui and Tong Luan,

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,170
we will surely succeed.

98
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
With Wei Cheng's death,

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
your biggest worry is finally gone,

100
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,440
from now on, Chang'an City

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480
will be yours alone.

102
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Come,

103
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,970
let's raise our glasses together.

104
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,880
Li Ling.

105
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,360
Nongyu.

106
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,720
I will credit you with a great achievement.

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,400
Thank you.

108
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
These are just cheap tricks.

109
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,420
If you're really capable,

110
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
go deal with that one in the dungeon.

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,920
Jieniu.

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,560
Even if that spy refuses to talk,

113
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
I have plenty of ways to make them.

114
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
What can I do?

115
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,940
As long as we make our move,

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
we'll definitely lure out their accomplices.

117
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
Brave soldier of the Tang army,

118
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm here to rescue you.

119
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
I can risk my life to save you,

120
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
but I have one condition.

121
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,760
You must take me to the Tang army,

122
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,720
or I'll kill you right now.

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Aren't you Chen Jingbian's man?

124
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,900
Why should I trust you?

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,120
You don't know,

126
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,720
I suffer inhuman treatment every day in the Chen household.

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,650
I've had enough.

128
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,930
So you're a suffering soul too.

129
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,370
Alright,

130
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,580
I'll take you to the Tang army now.

131
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,610
Let's go.

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,210
Come.

133
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,260
Master.

134
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,490
Are we really just letting them go?

135
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,180
Won't they just disappear

136
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,540
like a stone in the sea?

137
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,650
What's the rush?

138
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,040
My plan isn't just about waiting in ambush,

139
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,970
but also killing two birds with one stone.

140
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,360
We need to catch the Tang soldiers hiding behind this.

141
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
But more importantly,

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,680
we need to dig out the ghost hiding in our mansion.

143
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,840
Come.

144
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,880
Perform for me.

145
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,970
The hunter becomes the hunted.

146
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,940
Kill two birds with one stone.

147
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,240
Qi, wake up.

148
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,680
They're gone.

149
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,320
Qi.

150
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,360
Ling.

151
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,300
Nongyu.

152
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,880
Qi.

153
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,120
Ling.

154
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,850
We don't have much time.

155
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,520
Chen's people will be here soon.

156
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,380
What about you?

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
We have our own plans.

158
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,060
Please take care of Qi.

159
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,280
There's Xianyang Village five li away.

160
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,760
The Tang army has a garrison there.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,280
Perhaps

162
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,010
you might meet Pang Shiyuan and Tong Luan.

163
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,250
What do you mean?

164
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,640
Go with Qi.

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
He needs your care in his condition.

166
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
You're afraid I'll slow you down.

167
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,880
That's not what I meant.

168
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,080
Then what do you mean?

169
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,840
After this,

170
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Chen Jingbian won't let this go.

171
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
He'll certainly suspect me.

172
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
If you stay, you'll be implicated.

173
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Leaving Chang'an

174
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
is the best arrangement

175
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,120
for both of us.

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,800
Li Ling,

177
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,850
you once said

178
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,120
people like us with little power

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,820
must have aspirations

180
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,050
and take action.

181
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,220
I believed you before,

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,840
but now I see I was fooling myself.

183
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,120
I meant every word.

184
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,580
Then let me ask about your true feelings.

185
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,140
Did you ever believe in me?

186
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,760
Was there ever a moment

187
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,720
when you truly valued me?

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,040
