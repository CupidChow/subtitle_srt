1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,970
It's supposed to be a cheerful melody,

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,080
yet why does it sound so sorrowful?

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,400
It's from the Dunhuang Music Collection,

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,600
the 'Cup-Raising Song' you're playing, isn't it?

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,080
Indeed.

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,760
I didn't expect anyone besides Sister Pang

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,960
to understand music in this household.

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,000
This piece was originally meant to express joy and freedom.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
But your playing

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,289
carries a hint of longing and melancholy.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
It actually adds a unique charm to it.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,080
Rather than 'Cup-Raising Song,'

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,880
it might better be called 'Heart-Pouring Lament.'

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,039
Has it been so long

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
that you no longer take my words seriously?

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,410
Sister Pang.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,440
Who gave you permission to leave the small courtyard?

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,800
Nongyu didn't mean to disobey you.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,080
It's just that preparing medicine for Master Chen

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,280
cannot be neglected.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,400
Stop using Master Chen to pressure me.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Are you so idle lately

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,680
that you come here to listen to music?

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,039
Well,

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,840
what's so important about preparing medicine?

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
This is the flower garden.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm planting medicinal herbs now

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
that won't be ready until next year.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,650
Perhaps you could condescend to help?

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,520
You just know how to brew some medicinal soups.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,180
What's so special about that?

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Why don't you do it then?

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,280
Stop arguing.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,720
It's Master Chen.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,650
What are you all quarreling about?

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,250
Is my garden not big enough?

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Can't it accommodate the three of you?

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Godfather,

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,040
it's not Sister's fault.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,060
I was the one who overstepped.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I just thought the flower bed was beautiful.

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
I didn't realize that every plant and tree

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,680
was carefully designed and planted by you.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
I was too bold

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
wanting to plant herbs here.

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,420
If Sister Pang hadn't stopped me,

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
I would have caused a disaster

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,610
and ruined this garden.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,400
Sister Pang was right to scold me.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
I know you meant well.

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,860
I admit my mistake.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
I thought it was something serious.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,970
Isn't this a good thing?

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Nongyu,

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
I've heard

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,900
that you don't even dare to leave your quarters.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,240
That's unnecessary.

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Look,

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
my residence is so pleasant.

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,650
Come out for a stroll when you're free.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,040
And while you're at it,

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,840
planting some flowers and herbs would be nice too.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,450
Thank you, Master Chen.

65
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Did you find out about what I asked you to investigate?

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,130
Yes, sir.

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,880
Wei Cheng did serve as an imperial inspector in his early years.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
His hands weren't clean.

69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
He was involved in many bloody affairs.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,160
But it was 13 years ago,

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,900
so it's hard to verify now.

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
It's possible that Nongyu

73
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
had a grudge against him.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,480
That dog Wei Cheng

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,300
is a disgrace to the court.

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,760
There are plenty who want to skin him alive.

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120
If he hadn't been in Fanyang,

78
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
gaining An Lushan's favor

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,720
and An Qingxu's friendship,

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,680
I would have sent him to hell with one stroke long ago.

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,640
This Nongyu is full of tricks.

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,170
Pang Shiyuan is no match for her at all.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,720
They can fight even over a flower bed.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Sir.

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
It's not because of the flower bed.

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,500
It's because of Tong Luan.

87
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,760
This Tong Luan,

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,399
taking advantage of her early fame

89
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,930
and her skill with the pipa,

90
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
has been flirting with everyone in the mansion,

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
seducing men left and right.

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,180
Such an undisciplined creature.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I need to find a chance

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
to teach her a good lesson.

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
I'll make you learn your lesson

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,240
and see if you dare to do it again.

97
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
Bear with it.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,409
Does it hurt?

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,460
No, it doesn't.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
It must be that bitch Nongyu

101
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,220
who poisoned Master Chen against you

102
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,000
and made things difficult for you,

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,460
which led to this beating.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,040
Just wait.

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,010
I'll definitely get revenge for this.

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,320
Nongyu.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,330
What are you doing here?

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
I specially prepared some medicinal plaster

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,980
that works well for injuries.

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840
That sounds nice,

111
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
but Tong Luan got beaten because of you.

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,640
You must be feeling quite pleased with yourself.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,880
I sincerely want to help him heal.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,010
As for why he was beaten,

115
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
whether you believe it or not,

116
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,540
it truly has nothing to do with me.

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,280
Fine.

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Even if this incident has nothing to do with you,

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
you're always flirting with Master Chen

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,200
just to compete with us for his attention, aren't you?

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
I didn't come to this household to make enemies

122
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,740
or to compete with anyone for attention.

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,010
I'm just an orphan girl.

124
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,090
To survive in these chaotic times,

125
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,520
I must cling tightly to the Chen household.

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,850
Sister Pang,

127
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,360
we both live under the same roof,

128
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,300
surely you can understand my difficulties.

129
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,970
We're both drifters in this world,

130
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
so why hurt each other?

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,360
Master.

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Sir,

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,880
urgent news!

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,810
Something terrible has happened!

135
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Just as I expected.

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,220
The divination was accurate.

137
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,690
Danger lurks within good fortune.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
Tong Luan is just like us.

139
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,890
When the whip strikes his body,

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,900
I can certainly feel his pain.

141
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,520
If Nongyu encounters trouble in the future,

142
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,720
I hope Sister Pang and Brother Tong Luan

143
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,570
will show some compassion.

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,159
Sister Shiyuan, please calm down.

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,170
Besides, my back is hurting badly.

146
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's apply some medicine first.

147
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,250
Apply the medicine.

148
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,580
How should we respond?

149
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
I already have a plan.

150
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,580
Kill two birds with one stone.

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,000
Stop!

152
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Dr. Li.

153
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,640
Let him in.

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,800
Yes.

155
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,520
I am Li Ling,

156
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,840
paying my respects to the Imperial Physician.

157
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,600
Please sit.

158
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,540
This is the case that Chen Jingbian had made.

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
No need to open it.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
Just take it back untouched.

161
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,410
As for this drawing,

162
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
whether it will be placed in this case in the future

163
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,400
is meaningless.

164
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,280
This is merely Chen Jingbian's

165
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,680
way of creating a diversion.

166
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,010
I don't understand.

167
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,680
Li Ling,

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
do you know why you have failed

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,260
to obtain the Night Firefly Drawing?

170
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Please enlighten me.

171
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,000
Because in your eyes,

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,159
it's just a drawing.

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,080
You haven't seen what's behind this drawing.

174
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,680
What's behind it?

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,080
Isn't it the spy network?

176
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,140
Chen Jingbian has been in the imperial harem for years,

177
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
staying close to the emperor,

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,720
with eyes and ears everywhere,

179
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,760
knowing every official in court.

180
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,720
He was also personally guided by Gao Lishi.

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,560
Do you think he merely arranged

182
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,920
some spies and informants?

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
Why do you think he's able to maintain his position?

184
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
I've survived until now.

185
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,560
Why, when Great Yan was at its peak,

186
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,520
did Shi Siming suddenly suffer defeat

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,730
and surrender to our Tang army?

188
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Could it be

189
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,960
also because of Chen Jingbian's intelligence?

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,090
Playing both sides,

191
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,040
reaping benefits from all parties.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,280
Chen Jingbian has the means to do so.

193
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,440
His network of spies now spreads throughout the land.

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,840
This is his bargaining chip for trading favors,

195
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,480
and his weapon to control others' fates.

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,320
This old fox is so cunning.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,520
Doctor.

198
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,680
I think we should just finish him off.

199
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,280
Without their leader,

200
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,410
let's see how they can stir up trouble.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,840
The most frightening thing isn't Liuying,

202
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,340
but the Dark Night.

203
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
Chen Jingbian knows too many secrets.

204
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,920
If he dies,

205
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,720
those secrets that should remain hidden in darkness

206
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,440
will be exposed to the light.

207
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
When that happens,

208
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
not just you and I,

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,840
but even His Majesty

210
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,680
would likely find himself in trouble.

211
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,490
So you're saying

212
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
Chen Jingbian cannot be touched at all?

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,560
No,

214
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,200
I mean

215
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,000
he cannot be touched until we find the Dark Night Firefly Map.

216
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,600
This is also His Majesty's wish.

217
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
I understand.

218
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Obtaining the Dark Night Firefly Map is absolutely essential.

219
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,760
I will not disappoint you.

220
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,170
Alright,

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
you should go now.

222
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Oh,

223
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,040
there's a friend waiting for you.

224
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,160
A friend?

225
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,560
Qi.

226
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Qi.

227
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
Brother Ling.

228
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,530
It really is you!

229
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,570
Long time no see.

230
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
Xie Zheng.

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:53,920

234

235
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,120
Wang Linwang

236
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,640

237
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,920

238
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000
Tong Liu.

239
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,560
Li Zhang.

241
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Li Zhang.

242
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,090
Li Zhang.

243
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,280
Liu Wang.

244

Jia Ningtao Jia.

246
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,360
Jia Ningtao Jiaying Xidou Rong Jing Shou Peng.

247
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,160

248
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,280

249
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Assistant Li.
