1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Wei.

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
But you shouldn't take me for a fool.

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,880
Wei Cheng controls the Jingzhao Prefecture.

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,140
Here in Chang'an City,

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,960
he and I, Chen Jingbian, each rule our own domain.

6
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,380
He's also notoriously cowardly and lecherous.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,900
You, as a handsome doctor,

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,959
well-versed in the art of health preservation,

9
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,040
must know

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,800
why Prefect Wei invited you for tea.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
All that talk about living in chaotic times.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,130
Claiming you only sought protection.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
And that Wei Cheng

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
was your best option.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Yet you

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,600
schemed elaborately

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,690
and plotted carefully,

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,680
risking everything to get close to me.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,200
How can I trust you?

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,720
I won't hold your previous words against you.

21
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,600
I'll give you one last chance

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,120
to tell me the truth.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,040
Lord Chen,

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,640
please help this humble servant seek justice!

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,040
My family has practiced medicine for generations.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,640
My father was especially skilled in medicine.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,570
Thirteen years ago, he happened to save an imperial inspector.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,290
But that dog of an official coveted our family's wealth.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,400
After recovering, he brought men to murder my entire family.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
I was fortunate to escape by playing dead.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,520
But my father, mother, and little brother

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
were all brutally slaughtered.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,860
I made inquiries everywhere.

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,920
Finally, heaven rewarded my persistence

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,850
and I discovered

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,960
that the scoundrel had transformed himself

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
into the Prefect of Chang'an City.

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,730
I went to great lengths to come to your side

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,600
just to earn your trust.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
Help me kill Wei Cheng

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,320
and avenge my family.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,400
So you're telling me

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
that everything you told me before

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
was a lie.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Do you know the price

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,300
for not telling the truth?

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,120
Li Ling.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,770
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Give me the knife.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,530
Sir Chen,

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,860
what are you doing?

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,079
Let me see how determined you really are.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,860
My worthless life means nothing.

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Please, Master Chen, avenge my family.

55
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,760
Li Ling!

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,660
What are you doing?

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
In response to you, sir,

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,730
this woman must not die.

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,360
Since this woman is valuable medicine for Master Chen,

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,760
though a mere servant's life is worthless,

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,159
but if it delays your treatment,

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
wouldn't that be a shame?

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
All right.

64
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Stop crying.

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,440
You poor thing.

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,280
Get up now.

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,920
Come.

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
This time,

69
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,960
you've told me the truth, right?

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,280
Will you dare to lie again?

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,280
Good.

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Li Ling.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,880
Yes.

74
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Get things ready.

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,120
Tomorrow we'll welcome Nongyu into our home.

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Yes.

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,080
Father.

78
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,280
Mother.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,780
Xiaochuan.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
It's coming soon.

81
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,480
The day I avenge you

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,520
is not far away.

83
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,660
Mother.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,040
Xiaochuan.

85
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
Xiaochuan.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,380
Miss Nongyu, this way please.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,220
The master is waiting for you.

88
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
I, Nongyu,

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,880
thank you for your protection, Lord Chen.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Here I am.

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Have you met all these ladies?

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,520
To welcome you to our household,

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
I've called them all here.

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,800
Nongyu,

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
From now on, in this room,

96
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,680
you'll have your own place.

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,520
But whether you can please our family in the future,

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
depends on your skills and talents.

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm just a healer,

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,280
how could I compare myself to these ladies?

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Whether it's treating patients

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
or serving tea,

103
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Just look at them.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,520
Which one of them doesn't follow orders?

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
Or perhaps

106
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
you think you're better than them?

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,490
I wouldn't dare.

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Shiyuan.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Father.

110
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,580
From now on, you two will address each other as sisters.

111
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,280
You'll be responsible for all arrangements for Nongyu's entry into the household.

112
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
Don't worry, Father.

113
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll make sure she falls in line.

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,560
May I ask how old you are?

115
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,130
Should I call you elder sister or younger sister?

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm new here.

117
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
How could I presume to be your elder?

118
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
Follow me.

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
What's meant to happen will happen.

120
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,720
Besides, isn't it better to have one more sister?

121
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Father,

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,120
are you disappointed in me?

123
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,720
How could a father ever be disappointed in his daughter?

124
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
My dear girl.

125
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,440
I care about you more than anything.

126
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Look around this household.

127
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
Who else is like you?

128
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
You're my confidant.

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,720
You are my eyes in this household.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
If that Nongyu dares to cause any trouble,

131
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
don't take her life,

132
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,770
just break her legs.

133
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Otherwise she'll think my household

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,680
is a place where she can come

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
and go as she pleases.

136
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,560
From today on, you'll be living here.

137
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
All food, drink and expenses here

138
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
will be under my control.

139
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Every morning, you must come to my courtyard to pay respects.

140
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
Whatever you said,

141
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
whatever you did,

142
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,160
whoever you met the day before,

143
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,360
you must report it all to me truthfully.

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,280
Also,

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,090
without my permission,

146
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,680
you are not allowed to step foot outside the Chen residence.

147
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,740
Do you understand?

148
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,800
What? Are you not satisfied?

149
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
I wouldn't dare.

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
I was just thinking

151
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,940
there are so many rules

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll need your guidance in the future, sister.

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,460
I should think not.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
Please wait, sister.

155
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,040
Is there something else?

156
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,020
Your complexion, sister.

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
What's wrong with my complexion?

158
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,010
That's impossible.

159
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,480
And your pulse.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,730
How dare you!

161
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,610
I fear you haven't recovered well after childbirth.

162
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,250
What did you say?

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
When have I ever given birth?

164
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't forget what I do for a living.

165
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
Of course I know you've given birth before.

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Besides,

167
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,600
I can tell when you gave birth, the baby's gender, if you had enough milk,

168
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,160
and whether you suffered from postpartum depression.

169
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
I only need one glance

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,690
to know everything.

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,520
I suppose Mr. Chen doesn't know about this yet.

172
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,080
Indeed.

173
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,280
Being his favorite servant while carrying the title of his goddaughter,

174
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,610
you naturally wouldn't dare let him know.

175
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,490
Don't be so smug.

176
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:07,920
I...

177
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,940
I'll keep your secret.

178
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,360
As a newcomer to this household,

179
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,360
in this mansion,

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,220
I don't have anyone to confide in.

181
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,800
Sister Pang, please don't blame me for pressuring you.

182
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,930
I hope you understand my difficulties

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,330
and my good intentions.

184
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
In the days to come,

185
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,220
if you're willing,

186
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,090
I'll treat you as my own sister.

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,340
What do you say?

188
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
I've underestimated you before.

189
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
You have your own methods.

190
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,410
I, Pang Shiyuan, won't let anyone push me around.

191
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
You know what?

192
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,400
You'd better

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,480
not give me any dirt on you.

194
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,500
Otherwise,

195
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,440
you won't even get a chance to speak.

196
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,280
I

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,960
You're looking more radiant than ever.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
How strange.

199
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Could that old eunuch's place

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,960
be more comfortable than mine?

201
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
No, sir.

202
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
It's just that the entire city

203
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,120
is investigating that undercover agent case.

204
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,880
Master Yuan was afraid complications might arise

205
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,940
so he arrived late.

206
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Never mind.

207
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,170
You may rise.

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,480
There's a new person at the Chen residence lately.

209
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,520
A female doctor treating Chen Jingbian's migraines.

210
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,460
Her name is Nongyu.

211
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,840
Investigate.

212
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Three days.
