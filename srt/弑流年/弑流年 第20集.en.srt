1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
[Wei]

2
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
It's not too late to regret now.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
Come with me instead.

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,100
Go with you?

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,920
To do what?

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,010
Rob and murder or swindle and plunder?

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,840
Bully the weak or harass women?

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
Should I be like you every day,

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,160
doing shady things,

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,040
living like a rat in the gutter,

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
despised and hated by everyone?

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000
I never knew you were such a talker.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,090
Talked yourself hoarse, haven't you?

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,850
[Li Ling]

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
You slept with my woman,

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,720
and you still have the nerve to act righteous.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,380
Su Changming, let me tell you,

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,720
from today on,

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,520
I have nothing to do with your Guantian Society.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,580
Whatever you want,

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,560
get it yourself with your own abilities.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,600
What I want is none of your business.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,560
Nongyu,

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
don't be fooled by him.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,500
Only I can help you.

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
Li Ling and I appreciate each other

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,380
and are in love.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
This is my choice.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,000
Fine.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,160
Since things have come to this,

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,820
I won't be polite anymore.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,729
Today, between you two,

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,060
only one can leave this place.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,780
As for who it will be...

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
You decide.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,530
Then I'll give you two choices as well.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,410
Either kneel and beg for mercy,

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,160
or...

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,180
have your head separated from your body.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Yu Linxun.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,220
That sword in his hand,

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,570
is it your father's?

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Indeed, it's my father's treasured sword.

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Then he couldn't possibly know

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,880
who killed your father back then.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,720
I heard in the army

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
that General Feng's treasured sword

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,480
was unfortunately lost during the battle of Tongguan.

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,960
Later when I joined the Chen household,

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I saw Chen Jingbian playing with it.

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,920
If I'm not mistaken,

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
you must have bought it from Chen Jingbian.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
So there's no way you could know

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,640
the truth about what happened back then.

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
Master Chen, please.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,640
Come.

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,850
But you used this

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
to deceive Yin Niang

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
to make her serve him

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
and be used by him.

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
Am I right?

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
Is what he's saying true?

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,400
It is true.

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,480
The sword?

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
I did buy it from Chen Jingbian

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,060
and paid quite a sum for it.

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,840
But I wasn't lying.

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
Once you get the Firefly Map

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,920
I'll naturally know everything.

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,160
It surely contains records

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,260
about what your father did back then.

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
I'll definitely tell you everything.

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Su Changming, you bastard!

74
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,880
Return the sword to Nongyu.

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,800
I never said I wouldn't return it.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
I offered it to you before,

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,500
but you refused to take it.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Fine.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,050
No more arguing.

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,980
Here you go.

81
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,540
Take it.

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,130
Let's go.

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait.

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
I've given everything back,

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
so at least let me say something.

86
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,450
I want to make a bet with you.

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
Today you're taking both the person and the sword,

88
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,520
but I dare say

89
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,960
before long

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,400
you'll bring both the person and the sword

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,530
back to me yourself.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,500
In your dreams!

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
Loser dies.

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,000
Fine.

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,579
I'll take that bet.

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,970
Let's go.

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
Young Master,

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
are you just letting them leave like this?

99
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,530
Yes, indeed.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,850
Don't worry.

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,450
This is just the beginning.

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,540
The best is yet to come.

103
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,420
Do you want to take a break?

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,440
We're about to enter the city.

105
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,880
Why don't we go back to Tongxin Quarter first

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,880
and place the jade dagger at General Feng's memorial?

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,920
By the way.

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,960
You mentioned seeing this dagger

109
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,320
when you were with Chen Jingbian.

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,600
Do you know where this dagger came from?

111
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't know the details.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,450
I only heard from Yu Yaonou that

113
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,720
this dagger was probably given

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,380
to Chen Jingbian by An Lushan.

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,490
I believe

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,560
it must have fallen into the hands of the Great Yan army

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,040
after the defeat at Tongguan.

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,960
That old eunuch dog,

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,620
how dare he!

120
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,280
If I find out

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,080
he had anything to do with what happened,

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,409
I'll tear him to pieces.

123
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,640
Nongyu.

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,770
Miss Yin.

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,450
I believe

126
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,650
General Feng

127
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
would never betray his country.

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,200
Someone must have framed him.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Rest assured,

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
I will find the real culprit.

131
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
I will clear the names

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,940
of General Feng

133
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,810
and your entire family.

134
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,980
Li Ling.

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,180
The criminal Feng Jianye.

136
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,480
Defied imperial orders

137
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
and resisted passively.

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
Colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country.

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,780
Attempted to obstruct the imperial mission

140
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,760
and plotted to overthrow the state.

141
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,960
He must be eliminated

142
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800
without mercy.

143
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,690
That's not true.

144
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
The general and I fought desperately on the battlefield.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
How could he possibly betray his country?

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,040
Sir.

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,800
I am the general's deputy commander.

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,530
We have been here all this time.

149
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,440
I know the truth.

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
The truth is not like this.

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,140
Li Ling.

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,120
Silence! Don't say another word.

153
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,650
General.

154
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,480
Stop talking.

155
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,210
How dare you!

156
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
You're just a minor officer.

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,900
How dare you defy the Emperor's will!

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
And you, Feng Jianye.

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,760
Allowing your subordinate to disobey imperial orders.

160
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,020
Do you know what punishment you deserve?

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,140
Please calm down, sir.

162
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,200
A soldier's duty is to obey orders.

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
Both punishment and favor come from His Majesty's grace.

164
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,420
I, Feng Jianye, accept the imperial decree.

165
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
But I also believe...

166
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
Heaven's principles are clear.

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,700
Right and wrong...

168
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,520
His Majesty will be just.

169
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,210
General.

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,040
Leave.

171
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,370
That's an order.

172
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,000
General.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,440
Get up.

174
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,050
Let's go.

175
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,040
General.

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,250
Move.

177
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,220
Father,

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,130
don't worry.

179
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,760
When Chang'an is liberated,

180
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,820
I will surely engrave your name on it.

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
Master Chen, please have a look.

182
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,880
This is Feng Jianye's priceless treasure,

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,250
the Yu Linxun sword.

184
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,610
Indeed, it's a blade sharp enough to split a hair.

185
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,600
Sir,

186
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,610
An Lushan's envoy has arrived.

187
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
This great victory at Tongguan Pass

188
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,039
is all thanks to General Chen's brilliant strategy.

189
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,760
His Majesty praises you as Great Yan's fortunate general.

190
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,159
And the Night Firefly Map in your possession

191
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
was the key to our victory.

192
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
To be recognized by Emperor Xiongwu

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
is my great fortune.

194
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,700
For the grand ambitions of Great Yan,

195
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
I am willing to sacrifice everything,

196
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
whatever it takes.

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Good.

198
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,080
Good.

199
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
What about Feng Jianye?

200
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
That stubborn fellow.

201
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,200
I tried to persuade him for hours,

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,620
but he absolutely refuses to surrender.

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,800
If he cannot serve us,

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
then we must eliminate any future threat.

205
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
Rest assured, Envoy.

206
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,040
I've made arrangements.

207
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,240
Today, Feng Jianye will attempt to escape prison and fail,

208
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
dying under a hail of blades.

209
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
General Feng,

210
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,290
we're sorry,

211
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
but we're here to end your life.

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,280
General!

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,970
General.

214
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Chen Jingbian, you treacherous dog!

215
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,060
Chen Jingbian.

216
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,360
We can't return to Chang'an anymore.

217
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,690
We can go to Western Shu.

218
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
We'll find the Emperor there

219
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,980
and seek justice from him.

220
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Listen to me.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,330
My life doesn't matter,

222
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
but the foundation of our great Tang

223
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
must never fall into enemy hands.

224
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,440
Now the Emperor has fled west,

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,410
Chen Jingbian has surrendered Chang'an,

226
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,880
and half of our Tang territory

227
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,520
has already fallen apart.

228
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,120
As long as the traitors remain,

229
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,480
the war will continue.

230
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
Weapons will clash everywhere,

231
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
people will suffer,

232
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,520
and civilians will have no way to survive.

233
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,200
General,

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,440
we need to heal you first.

235
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
I've long known

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,930
that Chen Jingbian, that villain,

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
would become a great threat.

238
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,880
Li Ling.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,560
You must find a way

240
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,320
to get the Night Firefly Map from him.

241
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,850
General!

242
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
It's crucial

243
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,210
for our Tang's future victory.

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,010
General,

245
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,320
it's too late.

246
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
I don't have much time left.

247
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,210
No, that's not true.

248
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
Do you remember

249
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,360
what I told you that day

250
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,410
when you touched the jade carving?

251
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,720
The person you become

252
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,080
is not determined by your birth,

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,960
but is held

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,840
in your own hands.

255
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,260
General...

256
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
You... use your hands

257
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,560
to build your own achievements.

258
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
You are the best soldier

259
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,360
I've ever trained.

260
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,280
General!

261
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Take my head to Chen Jingbian.

262
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,280
He's naturally suspicious.

263
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,960
Only this way

264
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,160
can you infiltrate and get the map.

265
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,500
I won't.

266
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,380
I can't.

267
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
Do it.

268
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,960
Li Ling,

269
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,280
do it now!

270
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,840
No!

271
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
This is a military order!

272
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,920
Do it now!

273
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,120
