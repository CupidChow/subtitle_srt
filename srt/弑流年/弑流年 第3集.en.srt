1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey!

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,320
What exactly did you give Mr. Chen to drink

3
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,050
that's causing him such agony?

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,840
If you've done anything suspicious

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,500
and Mr. Chen comes to any harm,

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,660
I'll have your head separated from your body right now.

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Where is Nongyu?

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,360
Master.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm here.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,330
Mr. Chen.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,360
Nongyu.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,769
You truly have remarkable skills.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,010
How are you feeling now?

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,039
Don't you feel in your mouth,

15
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,720
first bitter then astringent,

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,640
finally changing from a musky sandalwood aroma to a sweet aftertaste,

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,760
instantly refreshing your mind and spirit,

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,820
as if your head has suddenly cleared?

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,240
Yes, exactly.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
My headache is actually gone.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Nongyu,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,360
what magical medicine did you use?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,130
It's not really any magical medicine.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
It's just that...

25
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,520
the catalyst is somewhat special.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,920
Medicinal catalyst.

27
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,160
Nongyu.

28
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,120
Come.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,650
Sit down.

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm not showing off.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,360
I just tasted hundreds of herbs in the Western Regions years ago.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
Over time, they've entered my body.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Some of them are precious herbs.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,770
Rare in Central Plains.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Just now I used my blood as a catalyst.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,660
And it finally worked.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,400
Using blood as a catalyst.

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,840
So you've turned yourself

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
into medicine for me.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Making this bitter medicine

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,520
into sweet nectar.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,060
I wondered why this medicine was so miraculous.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,640
So this is the secret.

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,040
Master.

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
Indeed, fortune comes from the west.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
Now with this excellent medicine,

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,770
it's truly a blessing from heaven.

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,680
I am deeply grateful for your kindness, Mr. Chen.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,520
It is my honor to help you solve your problems.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
It is my blessing.

51
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,280
Nongyu.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,079
You've done well in providing the medicine.

53
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,000
I shall reward you generously.

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,120
How about a chest of gold leaves?

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
I do not seek wealth.

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,930
Not seeking wealth?

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,130
Then you must be after fame.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Then I shall take up my brush.

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,080
How about I write you a plaque?

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
I do not seek fame either.

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
Money. You don't want it.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,540
Fame. You don't want that either.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,680
What exactly do you want?

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Guards!

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,079
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,360
Arrest her.

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,890
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,640
Lord Chen.

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,900
Lord Chen, please hear me out.

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
I lost my father when I was young.

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
My mother died of illness three years ago.

72
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,560
Born in these chaotic times,

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,600
all alone,

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
drifting like duckweed.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,940
I have no one to rely on,

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
living in fear every day,

77
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,300
barely surviving.

78
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Fortunately, heaven blessed me

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
to meet you, Lord Chen.

80
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,620
I don't want anything.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,360
I only ask for your protection.

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,280
Allow a weak woman like me

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,040
to have a place to stay.

84
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,380
I beg for your mercy, Sir Chen.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Nongyu.

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,040
Don't cry.

87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,920
Nongyu.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Come.

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
Come.

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,339
Your tears have made me

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,440
feel pity for you.

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Aren't you just asking for shelter?

93
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,440
I will grant your request.

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
Please be kind, gentlemen.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,320
Please buy us both.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Sir.

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,440
Sir.

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,440
Madam.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Come, Yezi.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,660
Let the lady have a look at you.

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
What's your name?

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,480
Tell her quickly.

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Little Yezi.

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,200
Sister.

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
Yezi.

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Didn't I just tell you?

107
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm taking you out to find a better life.

108
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,360
Look at this lady.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
She clearly has a kind heart.

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,920
Right?

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Come, bow to her.

112
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,000
May the merciful lady be blessed with fortune and longevity.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Please don't just buy me.

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
Take both me and my sister.

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
Please buy us both.

116
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,860
Young lady.

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you have any other family?

118
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,290
To be honest, madam.

119
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
We sisters have no one left.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,060
No relatives anymore.

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Chang'an is in chaos now.

122
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
We're homeless with no one to rely on.

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,720
We haven't eaten anything

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
for three days.

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,520
We can do any hard work.

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,320
Please give us some food, madam.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,360
All right.

128
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,320
The lady will give you food.

129
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,080
Get up now.

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I have a piece of bread here. Take it for now.

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,080
Sister, I'm hungry.

132
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,680
Come, Yezi.

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,850
Eat quickly.

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,570
Wait for me a moment.

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,300
Lend me some money.

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,720
No money.

137
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
That bowl of tea leaves you despise

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,880
would be enough for a full meal for these sisters.

139
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Mr. Li, as an official of the Chen household,

140
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,340
surely you won't let them starve and freeze.

141
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,680
Give me money.

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,770
You act like a saint while I pay?

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,409
That's not how it works.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Officer Li, you've spent your life tracking and arresting people.

145
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
You must have killed many, haven't you?

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,720
Why not take this opportunity

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,320
to let me help you accumulate some good karma?

148
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
I don't need that.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,060
What are you doing?

150
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,210
No touching between men and women.

151
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,120
Fine.

152
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,540
I'll give it to you.

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
Here, have some food.

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Little cutie.

155
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
I've checked.

156
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,570
The travel documents are in order.

157
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,760
And there's nothing suspicious about the newly opened clinic.

158
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
The rest of her time is spent

159
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,880
buying herbs and daily necessities in the market,

160
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,040
while all other hours she's seeing patients at the clinic.

161
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
What about the patients?

162
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,440
No suspicious individuals.

163
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,560
So you're saying

164
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,040
this female medical expert

165
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,080
is actually innocent.

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,920
Good.

167
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,800
Good.

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,120
Here.

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,640
So from now on,

170
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,920
we have another person to care for, don't we?

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Sir,

172
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,320
this woman's identity is still unclear.

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,980
We must not let our guard down.

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,680
Since her medicine is effective,

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
why not have her prepare it at the clinic

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,740
while I supervise?

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
Once the medicine is ready,

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,450
I'll have it delivered to your residence.

179
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,090
That's fine.

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Very well, very well.

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,290
How's the investigation on Nongyu going?

182
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,400
No flaws at all.

183
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,340
She clearly came well-prepared.

184
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,370
This woman's methods are extraordinary.

185
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
If she wasn't trying to kill Chen Jingbian...

186
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,600
So that means

187
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,090
she's also after the Night Firefly Painting.

188
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,360
Right now,

189
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,170
we have another formidable opponent.

190
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,970
Do whatever it takes

191
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
to find out what she's really after.

192
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,090
But you must be careful.

193
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
With her cunning,

194
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,100
she will certainly try to use you.

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,700
I'm well aware of that.

196
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,300
Last time she used Qi as leverage,

197
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I was only pretending to cooperate.

198
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,040
But no matter what,

199
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
I won't fall into her trap.

200
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
Remember,

201
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,320
those who cannot be used by me are enemies.

202
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,850
With Qi in her custody, there's too much risk.

203
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,530
We need to find a way to get him out quickly.

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,290
Alright.

205
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,020
Come, take it slow.

206
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
You just recovered and now you're showing off.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,760
Rest.

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,330
Go back and sit down.

209
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Sister Yu,

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,090
I feel I'm almost fully recovered.

211
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Come,

212
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,400
sit down.

213
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,480
I'll get you out of the city as soon as possible in the next few days.

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
It's better that way.

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,760
So I won't be a burden here.

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,490
Your brother Ling would worry.

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,520
Brother Ling,

218
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,840
they're conducting strict inspections outside lately.

219
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,080
It might not be easy to leave the city.

220
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,160
I have an idea.

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,300
But it involves some discomfort.

222
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,840
Let's hear it.

223
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,560
Lie in a coffin pretending to be dead,

224
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,240
and be transported out during a corpse delivery.

225
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,970
They will inspect everything.

226
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,280
Just throw some rotten pork in there

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,080
and claim they died from miasma.

228
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,140
Who would be foolish enough to check?

229
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,220
That's a good idea.

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Worth a try.

231
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,320
Look at me,

232
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600
treating illnesses, saving lives,

233
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
and even giving you advice.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,760
Officer Li,

235
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,920
please stop making things difficult for me, will you?

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,300
When have I ever given you a hard time?

237
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
Don't think I don't know.

238
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
You just don't want me to enter the Chen residence.

239
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Having the medicine prepared at the clinic before sending it over

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
was your idea, wasn't it?

241
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,880
Sister Yu.

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
The medicine is about to boil over.

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
It should be ready now.

244
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
As long as I'm here,

245
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,540
you'll never get close to Chen Jingbian.

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,620
Then we'll see about that.

247
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,560
