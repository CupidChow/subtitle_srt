1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Hey!

2
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,120
Master!

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,000
Master!

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,930
What are you yelling about?

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,880
Is the King of Hell coming for you?

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,160
That escaped thief...

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Did you catch him?

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,840
No, I didn't.

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,520
But I caught a big fish.

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,320
You little brat!

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,580
What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,760
You didn't catch the thief.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,360
Instead, two lives were lost under your watch.

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
And you still had time to catch fish?

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,060
Where's this fish you caught?

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,400
No, no.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,400
Master, look.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
That night I saw clearly.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,780
These are the clothes the thief was wearing.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,080
What is this thing?

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Sir,

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,440
please take a closer look.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,520
Don't you find this object familiar?

24
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,440
So it was him.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
No wonder we couldn't catch them.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
I see now.

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,040
Dr. Nongyu, thank you for your hard work preparing the medicine,

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,500
but you don't need to deliver it personally.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,660
There's still one final step.

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,050
May I borrow your knife?

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,620
What are you doing?

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
The last person who touched this knife

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
died a terrible death.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
Are you sure about this?

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,079
If you keep struggling like this

36
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,520
and spill Master Chen's medicine,

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,050
neither of us will survive.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,340
Hold it steady.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,040
The final step

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,010
is to add my blood as a catalyst.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,500
Step aside.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,040
I need to see Chen Jingbian.

43
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
Manager Wang, you cannot enter.

44
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,420
Move aside.

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
If this matter is delayed,

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
you'll face consequences you can't handle.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,940
You really cannot enter. Please don't put us in a difficult position.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,130
Let him through.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,400
Yes.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,840
May I ask what brings you here, Magistrate Wei?

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,890
Sir, Nongyu is outside with medicine.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,160
My daughter Nongyu specially requests Mr. Chen to try her medicine.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
Li Ling.

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,970
I'm telling you, you're doomed this time.

55
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
Mr. Chen.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Mr. Chen.

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,600
You've misjudged people and nurtured a tiger that will bring disaster.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520
Today, I

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,680
have come specifically to solve your problems.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
If you put it that way,

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,640
the Magistrate is overthinking.

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Everyone in my household

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,160
is brave and capable.

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,160
I wonder which 'tiger'

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,560
the Magistrate is referring to?

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,320
That's him.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,810
Magistrate Wei.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,760
You've never liked me.

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,160
Today you trespassed into the Chen residence.

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
If you continue with inappropriate remarks,

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,760
it would be embarrassing if word got out.

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,400
Li Ling.

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,050
Stop acting innocent when you're doomed.

74
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,760
Our clerk Li is actually an undercover agent.

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,690
He's working with the map thieves.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,450
All that talk about solving problems,

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,440
when you were actually targeting my trusted aide.

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,010
Magistrate Wei,

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
since this show has begun,

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,560
please make your accusations clear.

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,920
Show this to Lord Chen.

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,040
Lord Chen,

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,690
these clothes belong to the map thief.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
This bone whistle...

85
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,200
Lord Chen must recognize it, right?

86
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,400
The bloodstained clothes and the whistle were found together.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,730
Li Ling must have met the agent that night.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
If they claim not to know each other,

89
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,840
even ghosts wouldn't believe it.

90
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
He's been fooling all of us.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
Li Ling,

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,570
you never part with your bone whistle.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,930
How do you explain this?

94
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,160
Mr. Chen.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
This bone whistle isn't mine.

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,040
Then show us yours.

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Everyone in Chang'an knows

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
you're the one who plays this thing.

99
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,820
Where's yours?

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Show it to us.

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,760
Let us see it.

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,180
What are you doing?

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,530
Stop this improper physical contact.

104
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,580
I'll give it to you.

105
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,120
Is this the thing?

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,730
Thank you for lending me the knife.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
Now I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
I was wondering where it went.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
So it was here.

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,960
The string broke yesterday.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,960
I tied it to the knife without thinking.

112
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,020
And then completely forgot about it.

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
This must be fake.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,240
You!

115
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,640
I didn't mean to.

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,680
I just took it to have a look.

117
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,410
I didn't know it was so fragile.

118
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,840
Please forgive me, sir.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,880
What a show!

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Magistrate Wei,

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
I had no idea

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,800
you possessed such skills.

123
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,000
If you visit my residence again,

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I will welcome you with open arms.

125
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,120
As it happens,

126
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
a few days ago,

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,280
someone sent me

128
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,400
a jar of excellent osmanthus wine.

129
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Come to my residence another day,

130
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,420
and we shall drink together. What do you say?

131
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Alright.

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,840
You fool!

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,720
Idiot!

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,810
What a disgrace!

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Li Ling must be playing us for fools.

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
What does it have to do with me?

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,760
He's making a fool of you, not me.

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Yes, yes.

139
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
You haven't figured out a damn thing,

140
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,220
and let Chen Jingbian laugh at us.

141
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,159
That beggar's worthless junk,

142
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,890
and you treat it like treasure.

143
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,200
Master, spare some change.

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,130
Get lost!

145
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
You little beggar!

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,640
You've dirtied my clothes.

147
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,500
Get out of here!

148
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,620
Hey! Stop right there.

149
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Bad luck.

150
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Wait a moment.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,920
Come here.

152
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
Let me ask you.

153
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Where did you get these clothes?

154
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Speak up!

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
I'll kill you if you don't talk.

156
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I found them in an abandoned house.

157
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
What about this whistle?

158
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
Found it there too.

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Sir.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,880
A child's testimony isn't reliable.

161
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,540
What are you afraid of?

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,370
As long as Li Ling can't produce the bone whistle,

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,640
we can nail him.

164
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,180
Take it off.

166
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,130
Come.

167
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,120
Go.

168
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,880
Hold on, Li Ling.

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,159
Who was that woman today?

170
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
She looks like a favored servant

171
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
yet dares to speak up.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,360
Sir,

173
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
I've checked.

174
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,940
She's a doctor.

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,040
I heard she cured Chen Jingbian's migraines

176
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,700
and is currently in favor.

177
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,300
To think she could cure such a stubborn illness.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
I thought that old eunuch wouldn't live much longer.

179
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
Lucky for him.

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Investigate this female doctor.

181
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,500
Find out who she really is.

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,570
Put some effort into it.

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,820
Rest assured, sir.

184
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,450
You stole the bone whistle.

185
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,010
Mr. Li, mind your behavior.

186
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,700
You're playing me.

187
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
If you continue like this, I'll call for help.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,080
Let's see what's faster, your mouth or my knife.

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,120
Why are you setting me up?

190
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,850
You shouldn't have stopped me.

191
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,760
What exactly are you trying to do?

192
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,890
Whatever I do is none of your business.

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
For Qi's sake,

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,730
don't force me to use violence.

195
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,440
How are

196
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,450
you feeling?

197
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,840
This is Danfei poison from the Western Regions.

198
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
Are you feeling dizzy

199
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,160
and weak?

200
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,560
Let me tell you, Li Ling,

201
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
I can toy with you.

202
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,810
I can save you

203
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,380
or kill you just as easily.

204
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
In my eyes,

205
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
whether you fight openly or scheme in secret,

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
all your power struggles are meaningless.

207
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
If you insist on stopping me,

208
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,520
even if it means dying together,

209
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,180
I'm willing to pay that price.

210
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,920
This is the antidote.

211
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
After taking it,

212
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,540
it will take half an hour for the poison to clear.

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,060
I will definitely enter the Chen residence.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
If you continue like this,

215
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,530
we'll see what happens.
