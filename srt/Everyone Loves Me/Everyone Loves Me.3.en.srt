You're really good at games.

195
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,760
Yes, really good.

Mr. Gu,

207
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,200
I have to say,

208
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,400
"Hero" is really the best idea

209
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,760
I've ever seen in my career.

210
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,520
I've seen many things

211
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,030
with an oriental worldview,

212
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,520
but "Hero" is already exceptional

213
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,030
in its worldview

214
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,520
and the presentation
of its spiritual core.

215
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,470
I hope to see

216
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,230
"Hero" come out someday,

217
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,760
but your partner

and making a name for itself
in the industry

223

shows that you've put in the work.

224
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,910
It's not easy for a Triple-A game

225
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,230
to get that kind of success.

226
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,230

I would regret it.

229
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,590
You've done a lot of preparation

To be honest,

233
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,150
I was really happy

when I saw "Hero",

235
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,470
but the truth is
that it's extremely difficult

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,590
to make Triple-A games in this country.

237
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,760

268
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,400
I insist

269
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,320
that we must show oriental aesthetics

270
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,440
and promote Chinese culture.

271
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,910

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,230
You're absolutely right.

275
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,910
It's all about oriental aesthetics.

276
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,350
In Oriental aesthetics,

277
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,520
the oriental element

278
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,590
is Wuxia.

279
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the most common way
of expression.

280
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,910
In that case,

281
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,790

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to combine the surreal

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,030
with the realistic part.

285
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,880
It can greatly enhance the gameplay

286
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,230
and the setting innovation.

287
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,910
That's a good point.

288
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,550
We can make Wuxia new,

289
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,470
which can reflect a high-level
oriental element

290
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,150
and avoid

291
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,110
the traditional martial arts fighting.

292
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,520
There are temples and ganghoods.

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,470
Boss,

751
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,230
wouldn't it be a bit too hasty

752
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,470
to submit it this month?

753
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,630
Actually, it would be easier

754
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,080
to submit it next month.

755
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,430
It's none of your business
what I decide.

756
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,470
Boss has a good reason for his decision.

757
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,230
Don't forget

758
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,360
the lion dance training at 9 pm tonight.

759
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,320
Maybe

760
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I'll get Gu Xun

761
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
in one go.

762
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,150
Got it.

763
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,870
I'll stop talking. Bye.

764
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,670
Bye.

765
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,840
What's wrong with it?

766
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
I've only used it a few times.

767
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,190
Gu Xun.

768
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,560
What are you doing here?

769
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm cleaning the elevator.

770
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,560
Wait.

771
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, no.

772
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,910
Gu Xun is allergic to this smell.

773
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,910
I'll change it when I get back.

774
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,910
Time flies.

775
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,950
We'll be

776
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,190
training together again soon.

777
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,670
By the way,

778
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,230
will training with me on Friday

779
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,560
disrupt your schedule?

780
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,120
Yes.

781
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,180
[Huacai Interactive Entertainment Co.]

782
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,190
I'll see you tonight.

783
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,430
He's so cold.

784
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,080
This new map feels good.

785
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,950
Let me play a round
before I go to the lion dance.

786
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,950
What are you doing?

787
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,600
Does your crush know

788
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,320
you're so reckless in the game?

789
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,280
It's better to be reckless.

790
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,230
I became more feminine as you said,

791
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,710
but he didn't react at all.

792
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,560
First of all,

793
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,430
why did you say "became"?

794
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,390
Do you think you're not a woman too?

795
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,000
Shut up!

796
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm going to see him soon,

797
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,870
but I feel like

798
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,840
he doesn't want to see me at all.

799
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,470
What are you doing?

800
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,320
What can we do at campus?

801
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,870
That's not important.

802
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,870
What's important is

803
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,600
that you should tell me

804
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,150
what I'm going to do when we meet.

805
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,910
When you meet, be gentle.

806
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,710
Extremely gentle.

807
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
For example?

808
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,520
For example,

809
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,910
have you seen idol dramas?

810
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,630
What kind of girl
does the male lead usually like?

811
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,080
The girl like me.

812
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,630
Then follow your opposite.

813
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,120
Use your softness to provoke

814
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,040
the protective desire
of your dream lover.

815
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,950
I see.

816
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,560
I'll trust you one more time.
