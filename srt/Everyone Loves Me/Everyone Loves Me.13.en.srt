00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,620
to Ling Yu at this key moment?

192
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,060
Focus on finding more things
to highlight about Lin Zhi's character.

193
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,940
Don't worry about anything else.

194
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,750
Get in the car first.

195
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,940
I need to take this call.

196
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,700
[Jiang Junnan]

197
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,460
Hello?

198
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,230
There must be something shady going on.

199
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,870
How can it be
that as soon as we think of it,

200
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,670
they are already in Beijing?

201
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,230
We must have been tricked.

202
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,500
Only the three of us know about this.

203
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,380
The presentation slides
were done by Yue Qianling.

204
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,460
Jiang Yishi is also her superior.

205
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,140
It won't be hard for him
to find out about this.

206
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,580
I'm worried that this might blow up

207
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,940
and negatively impact her.

208
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
You've changed.

209
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,500
Changed by love?

210
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,350
I'm going to go now.

211
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,500
No wonder we need
to contact Ling Yu's team right away.

212
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,260
It's to cut the 9th Business Unit off.

213
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,500
You're a wise man, Mr. Jiang.

214
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,580
Is that what you think?

215
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,790
Ling Yu is a guardian
of China's traditional culture.

216
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,020
She embodies positivity.

217
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,380
We also need a public figure like that

218
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,500
to increase the influence of our game.

219
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,790
Yes.

220
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,700
You remain forward-thinking as always.

221
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,670
She promotes the quintessence
of Chinese culture in the day...

222
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,870
What a bunch of liars.

223
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,090
Her image is completely ruined now.

224
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,670
[@LingYu]

225
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,350
Her character is entirely faked.

226
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,700
It was decided by the team.

227
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,020
In the interview,
Ling Yu has already said

228
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,190
that she usually operates a Taiji Center

229
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,020
and would teach children
who wish to learn Taiji.

230
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,460
But many parents disagree
with those wishes

231
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,990
as they think it's useless in life.

232
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,230
She has no choice
but to teach them for free.

233
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,430
But there's still the cost
of operating the center

234
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,430
and her competition expenses.

235
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,110
She has to earn money somehow.

236
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,310
Her job as a bartender

237
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,580
is actually a bonus in our eyes.

238
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,790
Have you noticed

239
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,500
that Lin Zhi can be just like Ling Yu?

240
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,020
They have two sides to them.

241
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,620
If Lin Zhi can transform
into a Zhen (*poison) at night,

242
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,910
then the common concept
of Zhen wine as poison

243
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,940
and the concept that Lin Zhi is poison
to evil and monstrous creatures

244
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,550
align seamlessly together.

245
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,460
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,990
I'm just too excited.

247
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,990
I have an idea.

248
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,700
Let me draw it out to test.

249
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,260
Sir,

250
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,430
drive steadily.

251
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,190
Okay.

252
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,710
The E'mei spear emphasizes the harmony
between motion and stillness,

253
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,590
resulting in powerful

254
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,830
and unwavering might.

255
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,310
It's a spectacular sight in motion

256
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,100
with the user's body curving gracefully
through the air.

257
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,550
The Miao Dao is a weapon
from the Han dynasty.

258
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,430
Its focus is
on continuous rolls and strikes

259
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,550
that are fast and strong.

260
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,190
It's a formidable weapon.

261
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,380
Look at Ling Yu.

262
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,020
She is a master with every weapon.

263
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,860
She truly fits very well with
Senluo Morph.

264
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,220
That's why we must win her over.

265
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,140
Ma'am,

266
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,790
next up, we will be filming

267
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,340
the segment on Taiji.

268
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,100
- Okay.
- For now,

269
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,070
you can rest for a while.

270
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,620
Sure.

271
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,340
I'll call you later.

272
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,140
See you later.

273
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,190
- Okay.
- I'll be going now.

274
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,100
Thank you so much.

275
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,190
Ms. Ling Yu,

276
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,340
hello.

277
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,590
Hello, Ms. Ling Yu.

278
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,380
Hi.

279
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,710
Hi.

280
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,260
We're from the 9th Business Unit
of HC Interactive.

281
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,670
We once contacted you

282
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,620
about working together
for a character in Hero's Path.

283
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,830
We really think
you are the perfect match

284
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,260
for our character, Lin Zhi.

285
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,620
I saw that.

286
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,860
I really like her too,

287
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,830
but another mobile game developer

288
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,190
from your company contacted me first.

289
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,100
Also,

290
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,740
their offer is even more generous

291
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,020
with greater exposure.

292
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm sorry

293
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,910
for making you come here for nothing.

294
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,670
Ms. Ling Yu,

295
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,340
please hear me out...

296
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,470
Are you okay?

297
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,100
It hurts.

298
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,980
Ms. Ling Yu.

299
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,500
Ms. Ling Yu,

300
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,140
just now,

301
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,220

302
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,310
Hurt?

303
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,430
How are you?

304
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,310
I sprained my ankle.

305
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,500
Come. Let me see.

306
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,260
It might be a fracture.

307
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,790
Send him to the hospital
to get it looked at.

308
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,790
Okay. Come help me.

309
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,710
Let's get him to the hospital.

310
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,310
Here.

311
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,790
Come. Slowly.

312
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,730
- Call me when the scans are done.
- Careful.

313
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,450
Okay.

314

do you have any other assistants?

For our segment on Taiji later,

318
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,620
is there anyone
who can perform with you?

319
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,710
I don't have an assistant.

320

That's my friend

321

who came to help.

322

There's one here!

323
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,670
He knows Taiji.

324
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,980
Ms. Ling Yu, can you
give us another chance

325
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,670
and hear our brief out?

326
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,710
If you can keep up with me,

327
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,070
I'll listen.

328
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,430
I didn't expect

329
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,670

This segment is very challenging
for the team.

358
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,740
You need a team that's strong enough.

Why don't

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,830
a set of day-night states.

377
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,500
During the day,

378
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,310
she is just Lin Zhi,

379
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,790
an ordinary owner of an ordinary inn.

380
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,190
She lives side by side
with the regular townspeople.

381
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,140
Once night falls,

382
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,380
she transforms into a Zhen

383
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,100
slaying monstrous creatures
and villains.

384
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,620
She and Ming Chen, the male lead,
have sworn

385
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,070
to protect the citizens with one
in the light and one in the shadows.

386
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,670
The mobile game
will give you great exposure,

387
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,740
none of the characters

388
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,140
are like you at all.

389
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,100
Hero's Path, whether due
to Lin Zhi's character

390
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,340
or the heart of the game,

391
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,260
is a perfect fit for you.

392
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,590
What do you mean?

393
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,950
The essence of Hero's Path and Lin Zhi

394
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,670
is "Millions may object,

395
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,910
but I still march on".

396
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,620
It's just like
how we're developing a Triple-A game.

397
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,670
While we stumble
into many obstacles along the way

398
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,190
and practically no one

399
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,740
believes that we can do it,

400
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,220
and we might face even more challenges
in the future,

401
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,590
but none of that is important.

402
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,190
Because we have faith

403
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,980
that we're doing the right thing.

404
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,430
Here. Have a look.

405
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,310
This is a game I plan to develop.

406
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,100
It's a Triple-A.

407
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,470
Will this Triple-A game

408
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,100
be too hard?

409
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,670
Don't worry. Read through it first.

410
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,670
Just what is going on with this project?

411
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,550
I am here to invest,

412
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,430
not to play games with you!

413
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,710
Leave.

414
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,020
What made you think of saying

415
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,220
"Millions may object,

416
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,980
but I still march on"?

417
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,950
That is

418
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,670
my understanding of Hero's Path.

419
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,980
Am I wrong?

420
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,340
No, you're right.

421
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,950
That line is exactly

422
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,320
what Hero's Path wishes to convey.

423
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,620
Let's go.

424
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,670

[Triple-mode

426
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,830
There are so many people.

427
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,590
Can we buy this online?

428
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,550
No way.

429
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,910
This bread shop went viral online.

430
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,550
If we order takeaway,

431
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,620
they'll only deliver to us in two hours.

432
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,260
We won't make it for the flight back.

433
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,430
Why don't I buy a drink?

434
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,220
You can line up for me.

435
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,670
I've already ordered what I want
through my phone.

436
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,550
You just need to grab the order.

437
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,380
Bye.

438
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,430
All done.

439
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Fast.

440
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,430
You've worked hard.

441
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,860
Not at all.

442
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,470
I waited one hour and one minute.

443
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,590

It's for a girl.

A girl?

449
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,740
What does she like?

450
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,620
Does she like jewelry?

451
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,260
Is she elegant and refined?

452
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,260
No to both.

453
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,790
She's quite unsophisticated.

454

Very unsophisticated,

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,140
but also very cute.

to give Ling Yu a gift, right?

- Yes.

Pretty proactive of you
to buy a gift for a girl.

I can't take it either.

Can't the two of you just have one each?

This is for girls.

It's too precious.

and require players' companionship.

The pets' entire mechanic
is in social interaction.

Our revenue

561
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,140
will be quite considerable.

562
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,220
We hope to establish
a positive feedback loop

563
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,140
creating

564
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,980
a forever new,

565
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,860
forever played

566
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,470
long-lasting premium game.

567
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,100
Guess who will win.

568
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,140
Wait and see.

569
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,860
Hero's Path.

570
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,220
As the first Triple-A game
to be developed in China,

571
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,500
I hope its concepts and gameplay

572
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,140
can exceed those of international games

573
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,910
while its characters and motifs

574
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,470
can show the unique beauty of the East.

575
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
This is the protagonist of our game,

576
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,430
Lin Zhi.

577
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,430
During the day,

578
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,500
she is the owner of Hidden Heroes Inn.

579
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,590
She graces the city with her beauty,

580
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,550
causing countless men to fall for her.

581
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,070
During the night, she is a Zhen,

582
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,430
the poison of evildoers
and monstrous creatures

583
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,710
who are killed on sight.

584
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,140
We believe

585
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,710
her duality

586
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,100
will touch the hearts of our players.

587
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,950
That's why she is also

588
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,670
a character with immense attraction.

589
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,500
We've already signed an agreement
with Ling Yu,

590
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,470
a sixth-generation Taiji master

591
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,340
who is a master of all weapons.

592
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,950
She is a perfect match
for Lin Zhi's weapon, the Senluo Morph.

593
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,220
Mr. Jiang's brief today

594
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
is very attractive indeed.

595
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,500
Based on the history of the results

596
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,950
of Project Department 1,

597
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,710
The Love Broker will certainly

598
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,860
bring a sizable amount of profit.

599
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,950
I'll concede that point.

600
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,740
However,

601
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,340
I still insist

602
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,860
that we must create a Triple-A game.

603
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,740
During my discussions with my team,

604
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,220
whenever we talk of Triple-A games,

605
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,950
they mostly come from
Europe, the USA, or Japan.

606
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,310
None of them were developed by China.

607
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,220
That's right.

608
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,260
Not a single one.

609
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,100
Is it because we can't do it?

610
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,060
I don't think so.

611
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,580
As long as we lock in our goal

612
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,470
from points A to B,
no matter how tough it gets,

613
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,860
we can always reach B from A.

614
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,580
Still, if point C appears halfway
through the journey,

615
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,140
the developer might take a detour

616
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,860
and slowly forget his goal

617
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,140
is actually point B.

618
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,510
We have just too many point Cs.

619
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,100
Manpower, costs,

620
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,750
innovations, company resources,
and so much more.

621
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,860
There are so many
that no one has ever reached point B.

622
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,340
However,

623
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,230
just because no one did it,

624
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,340
that doesn't mean no one is doing it.

625
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,580
Some people would stay up three nights

626
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,100
just to perfect one petal,

627
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,340
while some

628
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,950
would search through the entire internet

629
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,820
just for the game's setting.

630
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,620
We're not here to impress ourselves.

631
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,060
We are not backing down,

632
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,950
not giving in, and not giving up.

633
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,620
This persistence

634
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,990
cannot be measured in terms of revenue.

635
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,230
One day in the future,

636
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,540
when our industry uses Hero's Path

637
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,510
as an example
to those who come after us,

638
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,380
what we get will
be the most precious treasure of all.

639
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,340
30 million

640
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,670
might not seem very important
to the development

641
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,140
of a Triple-A game.

642
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,100
But with 30 million,

643
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,430
we can fine-tune every detail

644
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,300
to be just a little bit better,

645
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,270
a little bit greater.

646
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,380
When Hero's Path is born,

647
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,670
it'll make more gamers proud of us.

648
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,100
Millions may object,

649
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,580
but I still march on.

650
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,750
Dear shareholders,

651
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,270
let's start the vote.

652
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,230
Those who select the 9th Business Unit,
please raise your hands.

653
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,300
Congratulations, the 9th Business Unit.

654
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,180

659
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,270
Oh, my goodness.

660
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,430
That was a crushing defeat.

661
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,270
Did you see Mr. Jiang's face?

662
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,620
It was really sour.

663
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,270
Still, I have to say

664
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,300
that I was truly moved by Mr. Gu.

665
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,030
My applause came from the heart.

666
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,710
Yue Qianling,

667
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,710
come to my office.

668
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,620
Speak carefully.

669
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,030
He's now a ticking time bomb.

670
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,140
He'll explode at any time.

671
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,270
Good luck.

672
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,430
Sit.

673
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,750
Mr. Jiang,

674
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,750
thank you for providing me

675
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,710
with the chance to learn
from the 9th Business Unit.

676
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,230
You won the chance yourself.

677
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,820
Well,

678
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,510
I did not
embarrass the Project Department 1.

679
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,780
You're too humble.

680
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,670
You've also done a lot
to make the 9th Business Unit look good.

681
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,750
Well, I was already there.

682
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,300
Naturally, I had to work hard.

683
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,820
If there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving now.

684
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,510
The Love Broker

685
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,860
is the best project of our department.

686
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,470
Turn your focus back to it.

687
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,380
Center yourself.

688
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,670
Well, Mr. Jiang.

689
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,430
The pet states

690
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,670
of our four leads in The Love Broker

691
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,820
will be in your hands.

692
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,100
During our next meeting,

693
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,380
I want to hear your ideas.

694
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,190
Isn't our meeting in two days?

695
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,030
Won't it be a little...

696
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,990
The schedule is a little tight.

697
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,340
But you've excelled
in both of your roles.

698
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,100
I trust you'll have no problems
with your efficiency.

699
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,620
Okay. I'll do my best.

700
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,190
When the time comes,

701
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,060
share with us as well

702
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,060
your experience working
with the 9th Business Unit.

703
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,580
Let everyone learn from it.

704
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,620
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

705
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,710
Well,

706
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,230
if that's all, I'll be leaving.

707
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,430
I'm back.

708
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,670
How was it?

709
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,030
Did he scold you?

710
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,990
If you say that,

711
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,270
I don't think he did.

712
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,990
If you say he didn't,

713
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,860
he was being quite snarky.

714
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,340
Can't you speak plainly?

715
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,380
He just assigned me

716
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,670
my next task.

717
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,860
Other than that,

718
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,780
he also told me

719
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,540
to share my experience
with the 9th Business Unit's success.

720
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,230
I think he is giving you a chance

721
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,190
to make your stance clear.

722
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,510
You cannot praise the 9th Business Unit

723
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,750
and you can't undermine your allies.

724
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,060
What should I say then?

725
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,540
Actually, you can say anything you want.

726
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,470
However,

727
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,950
you must stand by these two principles.

728
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,860
Evade the crucial point
and focus on the homesickness.

729
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,950
I'll jot it down.

730
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,270
Evade the crucial point
and focus on the homesickness.

731
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,670
Okay. Continue.

732
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,270
When I say evade the crucial point,

733
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,510
I mean that you can't really share
your experience with a Triple-A game.

734
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,540
You must also

735
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
express your loyalty

736
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,910
- Loyalty.
- Loyalty.

737
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,540
to Project Department 1.

738
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,510
Okay.

739
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,510
You keep using the conjunction "but".

740
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,140
The conjunction "but".

741
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,230
Key animation for a Triple-A development
was challenging,

742
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,510
but

743
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,620
our current animation style

744
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,030
is more suitable for the current market

745
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,670
and caters to the likes of youths.

746
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,820
Not bad.

747
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,190
As for focusing on the homesickness,

748
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,950
I mean for you to express

749
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,780
that while you are working part-time

750
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
in the 9th Business Unit,

751
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,510
all you can think about is

752
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,340
how you can reuse all you learn

753
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,030
in Project Department 1.

754
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,380
In essence,
you are at the 9th Business Unit

755
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,820
your heart is in Project Department 1.

756
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,710
In that case, I can say

757
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,030
that I have my own opinion

758
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,950
on the situation I described,

759
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,580
and then

760
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,300
I'll express my loyalty.

761
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,540
I'll say

762
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,140
But I am thinking
of Project Department 1

763
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,750
at every moment.

764
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,950
You instantly get it.

765
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,620
You're amazing.

766
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,300
If you're in the HR department,

767
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
the worst you can do

768
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,820
is to be a director.

769
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,540
You're too kind.

770
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,540
Still, in all seriousness,

771
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,620
from what I understand of Mr. Jiang,

772
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,910
he is currently explicitly
and implicitly

773
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,510
letting you make your stance known.

774
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,540
During this time, you had best

775
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,380
leave the 9th Business Unit

776
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,270
to avoid suspicions. Got it?

777
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,300
There's no need.

778
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,510
He is the head of two departments.

779
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,580
He is very broad-minded.

780
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,990
Why are you in my department?

781
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,030
There's a gathering tomorrow
to celebrate.

782
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,030
Outdoor Real-Life CS.

783
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,140
Join us.

784
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,750
Aren't you afraid I'd kill all of you?

785
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,820
Did you forget the first time we met?

786
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,540
Things are different now.

787
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,620
I got it. I have to get back to work.

788
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,860
[Outdoor Real-Life CS]

789
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,540
[Real-Life CS Laser Tag]

790
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,510
Does Yue Qianling know
you're champing at the bit?

791
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,140
If you're bad at idioms,
you can keep quiet.

792
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,950
Can the two of you even get together?

793
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,910
It's my first time.

794
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,510
- It's fine. I'm here.
- When the time comes, I'll be hiding...

795
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,380
That's right.

796
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,060
I'm working on it, okay?

797
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,540
Morning.

798
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,270
Are you busy?

799
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,580
- Morning.
- Morning.

800
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,580
Fan Xing,

801
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,670
did you just arrive?

802
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,580
I don't think we have enough people.

803
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,270
It'll be boring if we fight now.

804
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,380
Why don't we recruit a few more people?

805
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,270
When it comes to
the outdoor Real-Life CS, might be right.

806
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,710
It has nothing to do
with the number of teammates.

807
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,710
For example,

808
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,540
I can play as well as ten players.

809
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,430
Excuse me.

810
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,780
Do you guys

811
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,340
still need more people?

812
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,580
Two of us are still looking for a team.

813
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,340
I'm sorry.

814
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,380
He just said...

815
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,820
What a coincidence.

816
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
We are short on two.

817
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,910
That's great. Let's team up.

818
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,780
Let's team up.

819
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,340
Mr. Gu, stop talking.

820
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,470
Come draw lots.

821
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,990
Xinyi, have you played this before?

822
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,030
Nope.

823
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,950
It's fine.

824
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:57,670
I'll carry you.

825
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,620
Okay.

826
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,990
Qianling. Xinyi.

827
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,270
I...

828
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,190
Red?

829
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,300
- The three of you are together.
- Red.

830
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,860
Okay. Let's enjoy ourselves.

831
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,750
Qianling,

832
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,860
I drew this for you.

833
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,340
Well, I want to be with you.

834
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,510
You're drawing for two?

835
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,580
This is for Qianling.

836
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,030
You hit me.

837
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,990
Thank goodness, we're on the same team.

838
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,100
Who else hasn't drawn their lot yet?

839
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,990
- Me. I haven't.
- Don't worry.

840
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,300
- Come.
- Don't be nervous. I'll be with you.

841
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,510
Not bad. Who else?

842
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,540
It's fine.

843
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,470
You have me.

844
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,780
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,100
- Hurry up.
- Don't rush.

846
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,380
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,300
Thank you.

848
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,820
What did you two draw?

849
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,750
Red.

850
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,540
What a coincidence.

851
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,670
The three of us are on the same team.

852
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,710
Let's stick together later.

853
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,470
Let's get changed and ready to start.

854
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,470
Jiang Junnan, thanks so much.

855
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,060
I was red just now.

856
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,780
Hurry up.

857
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,300
Morning.

858
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,100
Morning.

859
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,540
This is good.

860
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,340
The trigger is here.

861
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,060
Okay.

862
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,030
Let me help you test its accuracy.

863
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,060
Sure.

864
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,820
Dead.

865
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,100
It vibrates.

866
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,190
It's so cool.

867
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,750
Give it a try.

868
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,510
Okay.

869
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,100
Do I hit you?

870
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,540
Sure. Shoot me.

871
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,540
Dead.

872
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,580
- This vest makes it very immersive.
- Not bad.

873
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,990
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

874
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,340
Here. Shoot me.

875
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,030
Why would I shoot you?

876
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,750
Shoot me.

877
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,750
Do you have

878
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,340
self-harm tendencies?

879
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,580
Dead.

880
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,710
- Dead.
- How dare you! You shot me!

881
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,860
Ready.

882
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,580
Start!

883
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:58,950
Move!

884
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,510
Dead.

885
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,510
Dead.

886
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,190
Su Zheng, to the other side.

887
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,910
Move!

888
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,710
Who's that? Why...

889
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,060
Dead.

890
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,670
You're cowards!

891
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,580
You're cowards!

892
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,190
Dead.

893
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,670
Let me go, you...

894
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,860
Dead.

895
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,430
Move!

896
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,510
Other than Yue Qianling,
all of you are rookies.

897
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,340
There's a mismatch in strength.

898
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,540
Let's swap teammates.
