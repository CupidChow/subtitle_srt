They are here for a comedy performance!

190
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,550
So cute!

191
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,400
Yue Qianling!

192
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,200
What are you doing?

193
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,080
This move...

194
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,760
What are they doing?

195
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
- What's going on?
- What are they doing?

196
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,320
Are they a couple?

197
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,840
I don't know.

198
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Seriously?

199
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,230
Look at them.

200
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,000
The team of Jiang Ting and Jin Wenwen.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,150
80 points.

202
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,520
The team of Cai Yang and Cao Jia.

203
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
60 points.

204
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,000
The team of Jiang Junnan and Yin Xue.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
70 points.

206
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
The team of Yue Qianling and Gu Xun.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,350
60 points.

208
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
All right.

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,230
That's the end of the exam.

210
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,550
Dismissed.

211
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Why are you upset when you've passed?

212
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,520
Will Gu Xun

213
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,470
think

214
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,880
I am a retard now?

215
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
I embarrassed him just now.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,110
I'm sure he hates me.

217
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,840
What should I do?

218
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,080
Do you think
I can still remedy this situation?

219
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,520
Forget it.

220
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,150
This is the end for you.

221
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,760
Let's turn our grief into appetite.

222
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,280
Come on.

223
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll bring you to eat some stinky tofu.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,790
Let's go.

225
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
Did you both

226
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
plan that?

227
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,550
[Camel]
I just woke up. Where is everyone?

228
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,520
Is that how the people of Jiangcheng
treat their guests?

229
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,440
Anyone recommend me some good food?

230
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,520
[Sticky Dough Twist]
This rice vermicelli is nice.

231
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
If it's a chili dish

232
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,710
with some cilantro,

233
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,280
it'll be even better.

234
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,670
[Camel]
All four of us

235
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,520
in this group don't eat cilantro.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,470
Hunk, am I right?

237
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,230
[Sticky Dough Twist]
There are people who don't eat cilantro?

238
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,080
That's one less joy in life.

239
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
What are we eating later?

240
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,670
Cilantro.

241
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,590
Cilantro...

242
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,200
Cilantro?

243
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,400
I thought you didn't eat cilantro.

244
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,110
Have you gone mad today?

245
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,670
Can't I try it?

246
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,030
Seriously.

247
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,080
Did you get some kind

248
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,110
of incurable disease

249
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,590
and the folk remedy is eating cilantro?

250
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
It's because Dough Twist

251
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,840
said she liked
to eat cilantro today, right?

252
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
I no longer believe

253
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,790
in modern medicine.

254
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,200
Love is the only medicine needed
to cure a pretentious person.

255
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,030
Does it taste that bad?

256
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,470
Where's your character?

257
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,280
Didn't you say

258
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,550
I couldn't remedy the situation?

259
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,520
Besides,

260
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,280
I rolled around in front of Gu Xun.

261
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Eating stinky tofu
won't change anything.

262
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,230
Gu Xun.

263
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,350
Does Gu Xun love eating cilantro too?

264
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,960
When you are together,

265
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,760
at least there won't be an argument

266
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,670
when you eat.

267
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,710
In the future,

268
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,550
when he picks up our children,

269
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,670
he can bring me a bowl of stinky tofu

270
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,520
with extra cilantro

271
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,230
from the school entrance.

272
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,520
Wake up.

273
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,760
You should think about

274
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,150
how to add him on WeChat first.

275
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,110
Don't you think I want that?

276
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,710
He wouldn't even want
my WeChat for practice purposes.

277
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,150
It's even more impossible now.

278
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,960
Let's go.

279
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,350
Boss.

280
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,350
Two bowls of beef noodles.

281
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,350
Extra spicy and extra cilantro!

282
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,320
Sure.

283
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
Gu Xun is looking at me.

284
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,660
[The natural medicine integrated database
has listed cilantro as...]

285
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,110
That's because

286
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,110
you spoke too loudly.

287
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,840
Everyone else is also looking at you.

288
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,400
Is that so?

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,230
I'm sure
Yue Qianling is interested in you.

290
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,960
She has been peeking at you a few times.

291
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,350
That's all you are saying?

292
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,470
She is Yue Qianling.

293
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,670
Forget it.

294
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,470
She doesn't look normal.

295
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,440
Did you see how she
did the lion dance today?

296
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,030
Check, please.

297
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm not done eating.

298
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,230
Stop looking.

299
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,440
He is leaving.

300
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,710
Go and add him on WeChat.

301
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know what to say.

302
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
Just say what's on your mind.

303
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,910
I think...

304
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,310
[Domination Arcade invites you]

305
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,440
[to the 11th "Road Warriors" Tournament]

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,320
I wonder if "Wake Naturally"
is going or not.

307
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,110
How can you

308
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,880
care about that at a time like this?

309
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,910
He's already leaving.

310
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,110
Go!

311
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,640
What should I say to him?

312
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,910
I'm sure he dropped it.

313
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,840
Even luck is on your side.

314
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
Return the card to him

315
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,150
and use it as an excuse

316
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,030
to add him on WeChat.

317
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,710
Will that work?

318
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,440
Why are you such a coward?

319
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,320
Show me your passion
when you are playing games.

320
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,640
No problem.

321
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,590
I'm going.

322
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Do your best!

323

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,840
What do you feel about that girl?

325
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,640

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,960
Yue Qianling.

Gu Xun!

328
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,790
I told you so.

329
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,200
She came after you.

330
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,030
You dropped

331
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,230
your card.

Yes.

353

Thankfully, you picked it up.

354
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,430
It is troublesome

355
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,470
to get a replacement

356
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,000

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,560
You are welcome.

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,330
you should be careful.

[Get lost!]

363
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,350
Then...

364
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,880
Then...

365
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,950
Can we add each other on WeChat?

366
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,190
Sorry.

368
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,680
I don't know that you have a boyfriend.

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,520
Boyfriend?

370
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,400
Do you have a new girlfriend?

371
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,400
Me?

372
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Do you need anything else?

373
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,710
No.

374
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
Why did you do that?

375
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,110
Why did Gu Xun always witness

376
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,920
my embarrassing moments in life?

377
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,520
Well...

Don't overthink.

00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,310
We will have someone better
in the future after all.

380
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,070
Tell me! Why did he
push me to Jiang Junnan?

381
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,160
Perhaps

382
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,520
he was embarrassed to say that?

383
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,640
He's definitely shy.

384
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,710
Yin Xue.

385
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,470
You are really my best friend.

386
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,710
How could you make up that lie to me?

387
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,470
What do you plan to do after that?

388
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I've thought it through!

389
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,430
Even if I like someone,

390
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,590
I shouldn't change for him.

391
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,880
I want

392
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,070
to be myself!

393
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,470
Well said!

394
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,520
You're ambitious!

395
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,710
Is it possible

396
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,040
that Gu Xun likes my true self?

397
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,000
Come here.

398
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,470
Chop your cilantro.

399
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,710
Cilantro.

400
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,280
Gu Xun likes cilantro too.

401
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,520
He can't hide his handsome.

402
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,560
I am here

403
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,400
to get water.

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,520
Before we begin our meeting,

405
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,350
let me introduce

406
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,400
our new lead artist.

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,640
Any questions related to art

408
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,350
will be answered

409
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,430
by Wei Han.

410
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,110
I am sure all of you know me well.

411
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,830
I was the lead artist
of Project Department 1,

412
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,640
Wei Han.

413
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,280
I am now the lead artist
of the 9th Business Unit.

414
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,280
I hope we can help each other

415
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,470
and take care of each other

416
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,310
at work in the future.

417
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,590
Let's welcome him.

418
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,310
"Hero's Path" has been established.

419
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,070
We have drafted a schedule.

420
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,000
In two weeks,

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
the department will submit

422
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640
a detailed
and executable main project plan.

423
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Planning team,

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,800
you can take a look

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
at the behind-the-scenes documentaries

426
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
of "The Witcher 3"

427
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,920
and "Civilization".

428
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,230
It might inspire

429
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,000
your design process.

430
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
You can focus

431
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,680
on the stages

432
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
especially.

433
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,800
Understood.

434
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,560
Art team,

435
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,520
you can also refer

436
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
to "Total War" and "Sekiro".

437
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Remember.

438
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,280
Don't purposely imitate them.

439
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,310
No problem.

440
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,880
Besides that,

441
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,110
I also got seven games

442
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,470
for all of you to refer to.

443
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,310
I've sent it to all of your inboxes.

444
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,470
The leaders of each team

445
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,520
will submit

446
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,230
a draft of the framework tomorrow.

447
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,470
When we come to a consensus,

448
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,000
we will refine it

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,830
and hand it to the group

450
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,640
to be verified by Stella.

451
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,000
Is there a problem?

452
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,560
- No problem!
- No problem!

453
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,160
I won't take any more of your time.

454
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Go back to work.

455
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,920
Wei Han, stay back for a while.

456
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,070
A normal design style

457
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,280
can no longer match
the concept of "Hero's Path".

458
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,350
I might have met a bottleneck
in my career.

459
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,280
You are a wide-mouthed bottle.

460
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,110
That's not true.

461
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
What do you think?

462
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,190
Are you used to the working intensity?

463
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm lying

464
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,280
if I say it's not intense.

465
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,470
This is probably your only similarity

466
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,800
with Jiang Yishi.

467
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,310
I can let you hire a subordinate.

468
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,520
You can recruit someone

469
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,590
or use someone who worked with you.

470
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,880
I did have a good candidate
who used to work for me.

471
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,470
A university student
who will soon graduate.

472
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,310
She is creative

473
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,160
and capable.

474
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,040
However...

475
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,000
Jiang Yishi
won't let the person go so easily.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's recruit someone
from outside first.

477
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,160
We can recruit various aesthetics
from society.

478
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,640
All right.

479
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Leader,

480
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,760
look at the female lead's skin
that I just designed.

481
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
Her fan

482
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,190
complements her outfit.

483
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,470
I also tried something new

484
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,680
with the color.

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you think there's anything
that needs to be changed?

486
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
It's not bad.

487
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,590
Is the color saturation too high?

488
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,520
Not at all.

489
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,110
Do I need to adjust

490
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,680
the texture of the clothes?

491
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Sure.

492
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,430
Take a good look at it.

493
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,880
Look at this.

494
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,640
I believe you.

495
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,590
I believe you.

496
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,520
Why isn't
Yin Jun talking back to me today?

497
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,800
Him?

498
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,190
He has been
pursuing inner peace recently.

499
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,880
Should I

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
submit my drawing or not?

501
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,350
Of course.

502
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,400
Just give it
to the new lead artist directly.

503
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,710
You draw well.

504
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,470
You can leave a good impression on him.

505
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,710
Go.

506
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,560
Come in.

507
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,560
Lead artist.

508
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,800
This is the character's skin

509
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,470
that I just designed.

510
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,070
Take a look

511
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,350
and see
if I need to make any amendments.

512
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,640
Chinese-style?

513
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,520
Yes.

514
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,710
It's fresh.

515
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,280
However, do you think
the change in this style

516
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,920
is too abrupt?

517
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,040
I've seen many gamers' comments.

518
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
All of them

519
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,520
want to see traditional Chinese elements
being shown.

520
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,000
That is why

521
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I tried to do this.

522
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,710
It's not bad indeed.

523
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,190
However,

524
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,800
won't it

525
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
be too different compared

526
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,830
to our previous versions?

527
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,400
We have been using a Western style

528
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,160
but suddenly

529
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
we are changing to a Chinese style.

530
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,760
That's...

531
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,920
You are right.

532
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,640
However, I think

533
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
our game has been published

534
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
for some time now.

535
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,190
We do need some innovative attempts.

536
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,920
Listen to me.

537
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,950
Being innovative means taking a risk.

538
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,310
There will be a chance of failure
if you take a risk.

539
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,190
For example,

540
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,640
the Gentle Scum.

541
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,950
It's shown in a Western style.

542
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,800
How do you show it

543
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,680
if you use a Chinese style?

544
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,190
Are you saying

545
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,400
we should abandon these gamers?

546
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,640
I see.

547
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,100
[The 9th Business Unit,
Executive Producer Office]

548
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,280
This is the data you want.

549
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,590
I arranged it into a form.

This is the data you want.

I'll leave you to your work.

Oh.
