00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,740
I heard Jiang Junnan

190
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,410
mention the name

191
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,290
of a teahouse.

192
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,500
Something like...

193
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,690
Send me the address.

194
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,340
Okay, I'll send you.

195
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,810
Mr. Zhang,

196
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,930
these are the core members

197
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,450
of the Hero's Path project.

198
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,740
Today, let's get to know

199
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,770
each other a bit.

200
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,770
Welcome, everyone.

201
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,650
The main reason for gathering you here

202
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,690
is to hold a meeting.

203
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,500
Excuse me, miss.

204
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,980
This is a private club.

205
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,690
- I'm here to see someone.
- You can't just walk in here.

206
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,220
My friend is already here.

207
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,450
Do you have a reservation?

208
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,500
Qianling,

209
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,260
why are you here?

210
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,770
I must tell everyone.

211
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,380
I was nearby.

212
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,810
I saw Mr. Gu's car outside,
so I came in.

213
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,860
I didn't expect

214
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,900
to see so many of you
having a meeting here.

215
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,810
Wei Han, Yi Hong,

216
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,420
does Stella know you guys are
so desperate to leave?

217
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,210
Does Qianling know?

218
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,450
Mr. Zhang, right?

219
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,980
You're quite the strategist.

220
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,050
What you said before...

221
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,060
Yue Qianling!

222
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,810
I know you're deeply attached
to the company.

223
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,530
But I hope you can be sensible now.

224
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,500
Sensible?

225
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,650
How can I be sensible?

226
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,620
Hero's Path is now in a situation

227
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,530
like a game's endgame.

228
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,770
Aren't you good at gaming?

229
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,450
What does this have to do with gaming?

230
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,690
Do you have any idea
what they've done...

231
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,100
Stop.

232
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,170
Let's not argue here.

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,980
Yue Qianling,

234
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,810
I've seen many of your works.

235
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,980
I sincerely hope

236
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,570
you can join us at Walter Entertainment,
just like Gu Xun.

237
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,410
Mr. Zhang is right.

238
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,900
Given the situation,

239
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,930
you should keep a low profile
like you're using the "walk" key.

240
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,340
Struggling at HC Game

241
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,500
will only lead to a worse fate.

242
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,980
I like the way you put it.

243
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,500
Endgame?

244
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,650
Using the "walk" key?

245
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,900
It's two against two now. They're good.

246
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,290
In the endgame, press the "walk" key.

247
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,340
Don't get yourself exposed.

248
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,050
What now?

249
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,020
Press Shift to walk silently.

250
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,290
Then take precise shots.

251
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,900
Isn't that the code

252
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,570
Gu Xun and I use in games?

253
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,260
It means "Don't get exposed".

254
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,810
Could it be that Gu Xun is...

255
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,260
Mr. Zhang,

256
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
sorry for my outburst just now.

257
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,170
It's fine.

258
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,170
Let's sit down and talk.

259
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,340
Take a seat.

260
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,780
Guys, I assure you

261
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,970
that Hero's Path will definitely

262
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,650
have a better future
at Walter Entertainment than at HC Game.

263
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,730
You will have our full support.

264
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,820
If you have any ideas,
feel free to discuss them.

265
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,490
Right, Mr. Zhang.

266
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,780
I think what Mr. Gu just said
makes sense.

267
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,210
Given the current situation
of Hero's Path.

268
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,180
It's more than lucky
for the team

269
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,140
to find an investor
like Walter Entertainment.

270
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,100
Hero's Path

271
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,620
needs to look to the future

272
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,010
and be more diversified.

273
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,710
For example,

274
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,690
our previous concept of heroes
was one way to go,

275
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,250
but, as suggested
by Walter Entertainment,

276
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,690
the Marvel-style superhero

277
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,300
is also worth exploring.

278
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:39,970
Yeah.

279
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,410
Right, Mr. Gu?

280
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,300
Exactly.

281
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,380
I think we can

282
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,620
work on a trilogy next

283
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,970
so that revenue

284
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,340
won't be a concern.

285
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,250
I like this idea of a trilogy.

286
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,060
Any other thoughts or suggestions?

287
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,650
Mr. Zhang,

288
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,690
here are several revision plans

289
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,060
I've made for Hero's Path.

290
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,970
Please take a look.

291
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,650
Okay.

292
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,620
It's about art design, right?

293
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,170
Yes.

294
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,170
Mr. Gu,

295
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,300
you like green tea, right?
[*Implying that Gu Xun is scheming]

296
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,620
Let me pour you some?

297
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Mr. Gu,

298
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,010
don't you like green tea?

299
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,100
Come on.

300
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,970
Pick your favorite.

301
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Mr. Gu,

302
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,780
if you keep me in the dark,

303
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,340
how am I supposed to play along?

304
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,100
Look how I almost botched it today.

305
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,250
I kept quiet because you're...

306
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,410
too innocent, straightforward,
kind, and cute.

307
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,970
I didn't want to pressure you
with the plan.

308
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,250
So you thought I was too stupid to help?

309
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,730
Fine.

310
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,210
No, that's not what I meant.

311
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,970
Stay on your knees.

312
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,170
Don't let your knees touch the keyboard.

313
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,620
Tell me.

314
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,820
You played around
with my feelings today.

315
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,340
What's next for tomorrow?

316
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,580
I made a mistake.
I won't do it next time.

317
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,300
There's a next time?

318
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Definitely not!

319
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,740
[LOVE]

320
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,410
How can you be so childish?

321
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,820
What are you, a six-year-old?

322
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,730
Don't be mad.

323
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,010
I've been on my knees for ages now.

324
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,780
Don't be mad.

326
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,210
Fine.

327
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,300
You've annoyed me so much
that I forgot the serious stuff.

328
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,780
Let me tell you.

329
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,010
Today, I overheard

330
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,860
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang plotting.

331
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,340
Mr. Zhang said
that if you didn't obey him

332
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,410
after you joined Walter Entertainment,

333
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,010
Walter Entertainment
would scrap the project.

334
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,850
That's why I rushed over there.

335
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,130
Actually, I know what he's up to.

336
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,100
He probably knows I'm stalling too.

337
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,170
In half a month,

338
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,560
if I back out and refuse
to join Walter Entertainment,

339
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,010
he'll definitely restart
the plan of acquiring HC Game.

340
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,350
I see.

341
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,730
So,

342
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,690
Mr. Zhang isn't losing out
waiting for you this half month.

343
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,010
If you genuinely take

344
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,730
the game

345
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,580
and the 9th Business Unit
to Walter Entertainment,

346
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,650
he'll save more than tenfold of money.

347
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,690
Even a shred of sincerity on my side

348
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,650
would make him hit the jackpot.

349
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,860
Do you have a plan

350
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,900
for what you're gonna do?

351
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,620
Stella and I have a plan.

352
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,900
I'll talk to Mr. Li,

353
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,970
and she'll talk to Mr. Zhao.

354
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,690
So,

355
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,210
your fight with Stella was all an act

356
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,490
to make your departure from HC Game
look more credible?

357
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,140
Correct.

358
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,990
Have you thought about
how to convince Mr. Li then?

359
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,630
Actually, the key figure here

360
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,220
is Yishi.

361
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,250
Is he Mr. Jiang, Jiang Yishi

362
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,690
from Project Department 1?

363
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,300
Will he be willing to help you?

364
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,450
We don't know for sure.

365
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,210
How can you not clue me in
on such a huge plan?

366
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,540
Who told you to get up?

367
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,210
Get back on your knees.

368
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,340
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.

369
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,860
I've been on my knees for so long.

370
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,760
Was that long?

371
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,510
Wasn't it supposed to be 30 minutes?

372
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,580
Do you want me to keep kneeling?

373
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,690
Are you still mad?

374
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,580
Yes.

375
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,450
Get up.

376
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,780
How can I make it up to you?

377
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,540
Stop tickling.

378
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,010
Forgive me?

379
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,930
No.

380
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,650
Forgive me now?

381
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,340
No.

382
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,620
Alright. Fine.

383
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,540
Can I stay here tonight?

384
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,450
You wish. Get up.

385
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,210
I wish? Are you still mad?

386
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,730
Get up!

387
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,780
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,300
Speak.

389
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,060
What do you want?

390
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,540
I hope you can include
Project Department 1's profits

391
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,410
in the bet-on agreement

392
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,340
to turn Mr. Li around together with me.

393
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,060
Why do you think I'd help you?

394
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,540
The whole company is waiting
to see where you stand.

395
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,650
Many even say

396
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,860
that you've decided
to join Walter Entertainment.

397
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,380
But I know

398
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,010
your devotion and contributions
to HC Game

399
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,900
beat anyone's.

400
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,300
So you do see my contributions.

401
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,490
Yishi,

402
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,410
though you always talk
about making money,

403
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,920
I know

404
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,100
that your passion for game development

405
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,410
is no less than mine.

406
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,650
Don't think flattery

407
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,720
will sway me.

408
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,970
We're alike.

409
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,680
We can only be convinced

410
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,760
by ourselves.

411
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,900
So, Yishi,

412
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,710
what are the things

413
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,540
that truly matter to you?

414
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,620
This is the mango flavor.

415
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,580
- Thank you.
- I've got some here.

416
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Here's your straw.

417
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,620
Thank you.

418
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,820
Where's my drink?

419
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,820
Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

420
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,780
I'm planning to resign.

421
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,250
It's been over a year
working with you all.

422
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,620
I've learned a lot.

423
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,010
Thank you for your help along the way.

424
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,380
Keep up the good work.

425
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,730
Good luck.

426
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Come in for a moment.

427
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,380
What's happening?

428
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,300
Close the door.

429
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,170
Who gave you permission to resign?

430
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,490
I don't want to go
to Walter Entertainment.

431
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,970
So,
rather than facing unemployment later,

432
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,380
it's better to start preparing early.

433
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,100
Who says you're going to be unemployed?

434
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,690
As long as I'm here,

435
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,140
your job is secure.

436
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,970
But Walter Entertainment is planning
to change not only the props

437
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,410
but also the protagonists' factions.

438
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,340
Although I'm not at the tech group,

439
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,100
the thought of dealing with such issues

440
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,380
on a daily basis

441
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,690
makes me freak out.

442
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,690
Chen Xinyi,

443
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,170
we've known each other for so long.

444
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,540
It's true
that I've left some things unsaid,

445
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,650
but do you really think so poorly of me?

446
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,300
Since I joined the company,

447
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,170
you have indeed taught me a lot,
Mr. Jiang.

448
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,930
But you've chosen to go
to Walter Entertainment.

449
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,060
I have no right

450
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
nor position to tell you otherwise.

451
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,250
So,

452
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,250
there's nothing more to say.

453
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,690
About Walter Entertainment...

454
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,900
I think this offer

455
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,340
is indeed very tempting.

456
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,100
However,

457
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,580
the future return rate
of a Triple-A game

458
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,970
is still very questionable.

459
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,210
Therefore,

460
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,140
I need to go back
for a further discussion.

461
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,930
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,100
Mr. Li,

463
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,010
I think you...

464
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,250
What if I join too?

465
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,780
Mr. Li,

466
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,970
you know how impressive the revenue

467
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,210
of my department is.

468
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,820
With the upcoming release

469
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,650
of "The Love Broker 3.0,

470
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,340
the Shining Warm-Winter Pact",

471
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,580
our monthly revenue
will reach a new high.

472
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,970
Of course.

473
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,300
If this isn't satisfying enough,

474
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,650
I'm willing to offer

475
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,140
all the dividends

476
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,170
of the project's total revenue

477
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,410
as a bargaining chip.

478
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,820
Mr. Li,

479
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,690
we're very confident

480
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,820
about winning the bet.

481
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,490
I didn't expect Mr. Jiang
to be so generous.

482
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,410
Then I guess

483
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,780
I have no reason to refuse.

484
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,060
Okay.

485
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,970
Yishi,

486
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,930
thank you.

487
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,380
I didn't expect

488
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,820
you to go this far.

489
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,930
What,

490
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,490
am I just a profit-driven person

491
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,860
in your eyes?

492
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,450
Don't get ahead of yourself.

493
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,820
I gave up the opportunity
to go to Walter Entertainment

494
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,450
so I could give it my all

495
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,300
to compete for resources here
against you.

496
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I welcome competition.

497
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,410
Good.

498
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,860
Actually,

499
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,140
when you decided to leave
to make a Triple-A game,

500
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,620
I wasn't mad at you for leaving.

501
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,450
I just thought
you were wasting your talent

502
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,410
on something hopeless.

503
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,060
I still don't think

504
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,580
what you did was right.

505
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,900
But if there's to be a true AAA game
in our country,

506
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,690
you'd be the one

507
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,450
who could make it happen.

508
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,140
I know

509
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,970
you've always been
giving your all for the company.

510
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,780
Without the support
of Project Department 1,

511
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,730
Hero's Path wouldn't have
made it this far.

512
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,690
You're back.

513
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,450
Mr. Gu,

514
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,860
we misunderstood you.

515
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
I always knew

516
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,410
you weren't the type
to betray us for profit.

517
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,880
That's not what you said the other day.

518
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,450
That was because I was kept in the dark.

519
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,690
But, Mr. Gu,

520
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,250
that was truly a brilliant move.

521
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,270
Now you're practically the hero
of the company.

522
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,410
It's not over yet.

523
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Walter Entertainment has already
restarted their acquisition plan.

524
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,060
Mr. Gu and I will handle

525
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,410
the search for new investments.

526
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,210
The best support you can offer us

527
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,930
is to work hard.

528
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,690
Let's go for it.

529
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,140
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

530
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,100
Can I

531
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,580
drink this now?

532
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,900
Something's bothering you?

533
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
It's complicated.

534
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,060
I just don't get it.

535
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,490
We're both the so-called traitors.

536
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,540
Why did she buy boba tea
for you but not me?

537
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,060
Not to mention I helped her
with Coconut.

538
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Coconut?

539
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,860
Her tortoise.

540
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,300
That's what you've been thinking about?

541
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,410
Chen Xinyi is about to resign.

542
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,650
Don't you care?

543
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,650
No worries. She's so principled.

544
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,140
She won't find a new job any time soon.

545
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,450
Hello?

546
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,300
Project Department 1 wants Chen Xinyi?

547
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,250
I also want a change of environment

548
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,860
to embrace different challenges.

549
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,820
I believe I'm up to the job.

550
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm aware of your capabilities.

551
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,170
Welcome to Project Department 1.

552
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,820
- Thank you, Mr. Jiang.
- Chen Xinyi!

553
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,380
Who gave you permission
to come to Project Department 1?

554
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,210
Did I approve?

555
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,250
Come back with me.

556
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,580
Get your hands off her.

557
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,010
- Mr. Jiang, stay out of this.
- Jiang Junnan!

558
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,410
Enough.

559
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,780
Don't embarrass yourself here.

560
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,250
You belong to the 9th Business Unit.

561
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,540
Chen Xinyi!

562
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,690
Young man,

563
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,210
be patient.

564
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,100
At least she's staying at HC Game
and not leaving the company,

565
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,210
right?

566
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,450
Don't worry.

567
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,820
I'll keep an eye on her for you.

568
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,010
There's nothing embarrassing.

569
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,580
Nothing embarrassing.

570
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,300
He's keeping her here for you.

571
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,490
Don't you see?

572
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,970
Xinyi,

573
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,900
they've explained everything.

574
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Jiang Junnan was just putting on a show
with Gu Xun.

575
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,730
It was all a misunderstanding.
There's no actual betrayal.

576
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,010
Are you still leaving?

577
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,170
That has nothing to do with me leaving.

578
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,410
I'm moving to Department 1

579
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,210
mainly to challenge myself.

580
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,820
After all,

581
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,490
I can't always work under protection,

582
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,490
right?

583
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,730
That's true.

584
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,780
Then, take care of yourself.

585
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,620
Don't worry.

586
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,300
Let's all work hard together.

587
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,060
Do you need our help?

588
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,820
It's okay.

589
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:28,860
Gotta go.

590
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,780
Bye.

591
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,860
Bye.

592
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,300
Chen Xinyi,

593
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,580
you're taking the tortoise too?

594
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,820
Why not?

595
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,820
It's my tortoise.

596
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,410
Then I hope your new boss
will be as tolerant as me.

597
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,010
And I hope
you find a new secretary soon.

598
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,860
Someone more capable than me.

599
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,010
Xinyi.

600
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,140
Qianling.

601
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,210
Working overtime on your first day
at Project Department 1?

602
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,930
Did Mr. Jiang assign you a lot of tasks?

603
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,820
No.

604
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,010
I just want to get familiar
with the project fast.

605
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,690
By the way,

606
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,060
how are things with you guys?

607
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,010
Gu Xun and Jiang Junnan are swamped

608
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,410
looking for new investments.

609
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,010
But I can't be of any help.

610
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,690
If I can make Mr. Wang suffer,
I'll be considered to have helped them.

611
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,210
But we have nothing against him

612
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,010
even though we know he's in the wrong.

613
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,170
You mentioned that Mr. Zhang
from Walter Entertainment

614
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,140
promised to repay Mr. Wang somehow.

615
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,580
If we can find evidence,

616
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,820
we'll be able to expose Mr. Wang, right?

617
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,650
But they're usually very cautious

618
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,140
with these things.

619
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,900
How could we possibly find anything?

620
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,820
True.

621
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,610
If they are really cautious,

622
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,180
Mr. Wang would have someone close to him

623
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,790
handle the matters
he can't be seen dealing with.

624
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,700
Right.

625
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,110
He'd have a confidant do it.

626
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,810
A confidant...

627
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,080
Who could be

628
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,610
his confidant?

629
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,930
I just thought of someone.

630
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,820
His driver, Xu.

631
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,660
I heard this Xu has been working
for him for over a decade.

632
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,900
Xu's involved in nearly everything.

633
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,860
The last time when Mr. Wang and Stella

634
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,900
discussed the acquisition,
he was there, too.

635
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,970
I remember Wang

636
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,740
gossiping about Xu,

637
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,260
saying that Xu owned a company.

638
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,050
But it was actually controlled
by Mr. Wang.

639
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,930
A company?

640
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,820
Can we find it online?

641
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,930
I think we can.

642
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,050
Let me try.

643
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,180
Mr. Wang,

644
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,050
when can I

645
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,860
take over Sazo?

646
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,220
My son is about
to graduate from college.

647
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,660
I'd like him to help me run it.

648
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,090
What's the rush?

649
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm running it for you for now.

650
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,260
When the time is right,

651
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,340
I'll definitely return the company
to you,

652
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,900
alright?

653
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,260
I've got to go.

654
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,570
Mr. Wang.

655
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,570
Mr. Wang.

656
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,300
Come on.

657
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,900
Mr. Xu, hello.

658
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,220
We're employees from HC Game.

659
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,970
We've found

660
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,340
that Mr. Wang registered a company

661
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,530
called Sazo in your name.

662
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,860
We came to warn you

663
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,930
that you're in a dangerous position now.

664
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

665
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,970
Don't get us wrong, Mr. Xu.

666
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,180
We're here to help you.

667
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,530
We've also found

668
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,130
that many of Mr. Wang's illegal activities
over the years

669
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,660
were carried out through Sazo.

670
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,220
That's impossible.

671
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,380
I know Mr. Wang

672
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,490
wouldn't do something like that.

673
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,970
Mr. Xu,

674
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,660
please think about it.

675
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,450
Have you really not noticed

676
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,090
any unclear financial transactions
lately?

677
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,700
If something went wrong,

678
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,130
what do you think he'd do?

679
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,380
Would he take the blame

680
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,970
or make you the scapegoat?

681
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm afraid his move
of selling off HC Game's shares

682
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
might be part of his plan
to abscond with the money.

683
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,410
Once he successfully sells his shares,

684
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,860
you'll be left in the country,
struggling to repay his debts.

685
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,780
Chen...

686
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,740
I forgot she went
to Project Department 1.

687
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,660
I've truly lost the tortoise now.

688
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,260
Want this?

689
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,700
How could she be so heartless?

690
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,930
After all, I taught her so much.

691
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,530
How could she leave just like that,

692
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,130
not even leaving the tortoise with me?

693
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,660
It's so sweet. Take a bite.

694
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,530
Let me try.

695
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,780
How strange.

696
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,530
Without her here,
I feel like something's missing.

697
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,180
Are you two even listening to me?

698
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,010
Yeah.

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,660

without Xinyi.

702
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,490
Okay.

703
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,740
I got it.

704
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,610
What happened?

705
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,220
Mr. Zhao's changed his mind.

706
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,780
He's decided to sell his shares
to Walter Entertainment after all.

707
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,820
Changing his mind all of a sudden?

708
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,820
Mr. Zhang must have done something.

709
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,740
Now, Walter Entertainment's shares
have exceeded ours.

so that I could buy myself some time.

743
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,450
But there are only two days

744
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,160
until the acquisition vote now.

745
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,660
I haven't won back
the original shareholders,

746
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,610
nor have I found new funding.

747
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,140
I...

748
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,900
Honey,

749
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,910
what have I always told you?

750
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,070
No matter what you do,

751
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,760
always leave yourself a way out.

752
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,870
But you've never listened.

753
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,340
Alright.

754
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,010
Stop crying.

755
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,050
I am here for you.

756
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,450
It's a pity that we couldn't get
Mr. Li on board.

757
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,450
But Mr. Zhao and Mr. Wang

758
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,610
will still sell their shares

759
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,490
to Walter Entertainment as planned.

760
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,700
Where's Mr. Zhao?

761
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,820
He said he'd be a little late.

762
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,660
No problem. You can sign first.

763
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,410
Okay.

764
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,090
Mr. Wang.

765
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,970
Mr. Gu,

766
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,570
it seems

767
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,930
you have something to say to me.

768
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,380
This incident

769
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,180
has made me reflect deeply.

770
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,220
Over the past year,

771
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,010
during the board meetings,

772
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,610
you consistently advised against pursuing
Triple-A game development.

773
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,610
But I didn't listen.

774
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,010
I've always believed

775
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,180
that making a Triple-A game

776
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,050
was the most correct decision
I've ever made.

777
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,970
- Please sign.
- Okay.
