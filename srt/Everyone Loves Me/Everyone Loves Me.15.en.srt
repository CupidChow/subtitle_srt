I really cannot

188
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,010
return this dress.

189
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,540
In that case,

190
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,900
how much did you spend?
I'll pay you back.

191
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Are you joking?

192
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,170
How can I give you a gift

193
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,220
and ask you to pay for it?

194
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,900
That's improper, right?

195
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,060
I really can't take these.

196
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,780
It's fine. Take them.

197
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,940
Let's put them here, okay?

198
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,010
Okay?

199
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:31,980
Here.

200
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,740
Qianling,

201
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,100
what a coincidence.

202
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,610
I was meant to meet someone here,

203
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,130
but they stood me up.

204
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,980
You don't mind if I join you, right?

205
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,180
As long as you don't mind.

206
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,300
Let's sit.

207
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,220
Sit.

208
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,420
Qianling,

209
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,860
didn't you tell Mr. Tang

210
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,300
that you don't like food this bland?

211
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,300
Sir,

212
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,570
a plate of coriander.

213
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,540
Coming. Sorry for the wait.

214
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,180
Thanks.

215
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,490
That's certainly my fault.

216
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,780
My apologies, Qianling.

217
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,690
I should have asked you beforehand

218
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,570
what you like to eat.

219
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,740
You don't need to.

220
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
It's fine.

221
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,490
If you want to know that,
you can just ask me.

222
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,570
After all,

223
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,780
Qianling and I are together every day.

224
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,100
Is that so?

225
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,810
Qianling,

226
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,180
I've always wanted to ask you this.

227
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,050
Did the two of you

228
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,420
just get back together
after breaking up?

229
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,130
That's because

230
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,490
when I asked your mom about you,

231
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,250
she told me

232
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,780
that you're still single.

233
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,050
Qianling,

234
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,130
I am

235
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,050
someone you've known for 20 years

236
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,340
and a man who grew up thinking of you
as a younger sister.

237
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,610
I have to tell you

238
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,780
that in this day and age,

239
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,340
there are all sorts of people.

240
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,050
You must keep your eyes peeled

241
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,340
to avoid being cheated

242
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,180
because you don't know
what the other person really wants.

243
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,100
Remember that.

244
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,180
Okay.

245
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,010
Still, I think

246
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,450
- Gu Xun should...
- Qianling.

247
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,860
Enough.

248
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,690
You were friends for 20 years.

249
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,980
Please don't fight over me.

250
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,420
It's my bad.

251
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,370
I ignored what others would think.

252
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,570
You must have suffered.

253
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
Enough.

254
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,660
Pretend I said nothing.

255
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,810
I was just

256
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,980
worried about Qianling.

257
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,980
I actually

258
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,340
understand what you mean.

259
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,250
I especially admire

260
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,340
the relationship
between childhood sweethearts.

261
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,900
You're not like me.

262
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,740
I've never known any girls growing up,

263
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,010
not even the daughter of a neighbor.

264
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,780
Thus,

265
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,130
I don't understand
how to get along with girls.

266
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,420
Luckily, I met Qianling.

267
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,220
She tolerates me.

268
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,370
Ah, Fan Xing's calling me.

269
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,540
I'll go take it.

270
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,010
- Careful.
- Hello?

271
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,220
The dress and shoes are from you, right?

272
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,130
They're quite nice.

273
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,610
However,

274
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,690
I don't like to see my girlfriend

275
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,540
wearing clothes given by other people.

276
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,100
How about this, Mr. Tang?

277
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
How much were they? I'll pay you.

278
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,740
It's fine.

279
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,610
They're a gift for Qianling.

280
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,540
- Nothing to do with you.
- Don't.

281
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,250
You must accept the money.

282
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,130
You'll feel bad otherwise.

283
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,050
What on earth do you mean by that?

284
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,010
You'll know once you accept the cash.

285
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,420
Are you crazy?

286
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,130
I'm sorry. I didn't...

287
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,490
What are you doing?

288
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,300
It was an accident.

289
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,450
What is it?

290
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,930
He intentionally splashed this
on the new dress.

291
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,420
I didn't mean to.

292
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:57,930
Ah.

293
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,860
I've already
transferred you the money, brother.

294
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,100
Just who are you calling "brother"?

295
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,810
He already said he didn't mean to.

296
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,610
He...

297
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,660
Was it really accidental?

298
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,490
Enough, Qianling.

299
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,370
Let's just throw them out.

300
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:07,860
No way.

301
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,370
Alright. Enough.
Let him deal with it himself.

302
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,690
It won't do. We can't wipe this clean.

303
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,050
I'll take them to be washed.

304
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,780
I'll go right now.

305
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,660
Wait.

306
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,370
Why are you washing them?

307
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,250
You have an important meeting
in the afternoon.

308
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,980
Did you forget about that?

309
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,930
How can a meeting be more important
than clothes given by him?

310
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,810
I'll go right now.

311
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,490
Come with me, Qianling.

312
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,780
Let's go.

313
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,250
You can go by yourself.

314
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,570
Qianling.

315
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,780
We're already far away.
Why still keep up the act?

316
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,130
If I don't walk faster,

317
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm afraid your childhood friend
will punch me.

318
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,490
Your manipulative ways have improved.

319
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,420
I can only say we were an even match.

320
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,540
I had no other choice.

321
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,810
What a pity about the new dress.

322
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,300
There's nothing to be sad about.

323
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,570
We'll take it to the dry cleaners later.

324
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,340
Do you really think you're my boyfriend?

325
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,660
Oh, by the way,

326
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,370
I'll transfer you the money
for the clothes later.

327
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,540
You're cutting me off so soon?

328
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,220
Then, why not

329
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
later on,

330
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,250
when Tang Xin goes back home,

331
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,930
I complete the act?

332
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,010
Let's go.

333
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,050
Back to work.

334
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,660
Why is the power out?

335
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,450
Tripped the switch?

336
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,370
It's not going

337
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,010
to explode, right?

338
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,900
[No Signal]

339
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,450
Your maintenance guys are so busy

340
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,420
[Customer Service Center]
that you can't get the repairs done.

341
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,660
I had to come myself.

342
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,660
Can you fix it at all?

343
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,130
It'll be serious
if something goes wrong.

344
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,010
Don't worry.

345
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,010
I'll take full accountability
if something goes wrong.

346
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,810
Gu Xun.

347
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,980
[Yue Qianling]

348
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
[Customer Service Center]

349
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,050
Qianling.

350
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,220
Qianling.

351
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,660
Tang Xin?

352
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,340
Why didn't you close your door?

353
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,450
You didn't even turn on the lights.

354
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,050
Why are you here?

355
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,250
I'll be leaving tomorrow,

356
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,540
so I wanted to say goodbye.

357
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,300
What is it?

358
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,490
I think my switch tripped.

359
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,180
The wires inside must have burned,

360
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,810
and the overload protection kicked in.

361
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,610
You shouldn't touch this.

362
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,930
I'll get the maintenance guys
to fix this.

363
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,900
Okay.

364
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,860
Oh, by the way...

365
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,810
Doesn't your boyfriend live across
from you?

Why isn't he around?

When I need you, you're not here.

374
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,210
All done.

375
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,370
I hope the security here

376
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,900
will improve with this.

377
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,730
It will.

378
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,730
You actually know these things.

379
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,090
You've really helped us a lot.

380
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,370
Thank you.

[Missed Calls Yue Qianling(6)]

382
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,540
I've checked all the wires.

383
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,210
No other electrical leakage was found.

384
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,820
Don't worry.

385
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,520
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sir.

386
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,660
- Thank you, Sir.
- No problem.

387
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,580
Oh, right.

388
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,250
How much are the repair costs?
I'll pay you.

389
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,210
No need.

390
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,370
I can pay him myself.

391
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,540
Why are you being so polite to me?

392
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,300
There's really no need. Sir,

393
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,010
- Let me.
- It's fine.

394
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,850
- Let me.
- Don't.

395
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,700
Let me.

396
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,540
My dear,

397
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,730
I'm home.

398
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,010
Why are you only back now?

399
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,460
The power went out just now.

400
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,900
Sorry. I'm late.

401
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,850
We've bothered you, Mr. Tang.

402
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,010
Let me.

403
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,780
Done.

404
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,330
Okay.

405
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,730
I'll be off now.

406
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,460
- Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you.

407
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,180
It's fine.

408
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Mr. Tang,

409
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,970
are you okay?

410
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,370
Your boyfriend didn't do it

411
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,700
on purpose this time, right?

412
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,850
I really didn't mean to do it this time.

413
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,060
Are you okay?

414
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,490
I'm fine.

415
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,180
Mr. Gu,

416
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,250
when you're dating someone,

417
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,940
you need to have a sense
of responsibility.

418
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,250
You can't find excuses because of work.

419
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,610
If I wasn't here this time,

420
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,700
what would Qianling have done?

421
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,420
She's a precious baby at home.

422
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,820
If her parents find out,

423
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,130
they'll be very upset.

424
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,700
They won't.

425
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,130
My parents aren't that controlling.

426
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,370
Qianling,

427
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,700
it's my fault.

428
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,610
From now on,
I'll stand guard by your side 24/7.

429
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,850
Can you not be so clingy?

430
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,210
Let's give each other some space,

431
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,010
okay?

432
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,820
Am I clingy?

433
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,850
I'll be going now, Qianling.

434
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,210
Mr. Tang,

435
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,330
I'll walk you out.

436
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,130
Let's go.

437
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,210
Bye.

438
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,490
Enough.

439
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,700
You don't need to walk me out.

440
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,700
Actually,

441
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
you don't need to act before me.

442
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,490
You and Qianling

443
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,420
aren't that close.

444
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,730
Whether or not we're close

445
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,900
does not need to be showcased
before outsiders.

446
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,820
I truly like Qianling.

447
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,210
I won't be swayed
because of any external factors.

448
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,580
Our relationship will improve.

449
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,900
As for you, Mr. Tang,

450
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,250
you're getting on in age.

451
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,730
You should act with an adult's maturity.

452
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,540
Stop using the excuse
that you're childhood friends.

453
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,010
Enough.

454
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,580
You should also stop being a wimp

455
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,730
and take good care of Qianling.

456
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,490
Otherwise, I'll be back again.

457
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,300
Have a nice trip.

458
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,180
You are...

459
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,610
You're out late.

460
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,370
Your clothes...

461
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,010
Ah, I'm an undercover detective.

462
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,060
Two days ago, your girlfriend

463
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,660
was being followed, right?

464
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,130
I'm here to patrol the area

465
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,180
and see if anyone suspicious is around.

466
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,850
Sorry to bother you.

467
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,420
Well, I'm off.

468
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,210
Hello?

469
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,010
Are you back?

470
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,610
Are we still acting?
I'm sick to the gills of it.

471
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,060
This is the exact moment
when we need to test our skills.

472
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,210
Behave.

473
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,540
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

474
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,210
Before I return, stay in my place

475
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,660
to avoid any evildoers breaking
into your home.

476
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,300
Okay.

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,700
Safe travels.

478
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,850
Bye.

479
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,940
The act's not over yet.

480
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,850
When you're home alone,

481
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,730
eat well and rest well.

482
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,090
You too.

483
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,540
Take care of your health.

484
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,090
Don't miss me too much.

485
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,330
I'm off.

486
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,490
Bye.

487
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,420
Was it fun?

488
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,940
It really is you.

489
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,700
- I'll kill you, you stalker.
- Yue Qianling.

490
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,970
Yue Qianling, calm down.

491
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,610
- Calm down.
- I refuse.

492
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,580
Let's call the police first.

493
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,730
You are

494
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,780
stepping on my feet.

495
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,250
I'm sorry.

496
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,300
[Police]
Why did you drag me here?

497
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,060
You have the wrong man.

498
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,300
It wasn't me.

499
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,900
[Jiangcheng Police]

500
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,610
How did you capture him?

501
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,540
I kept thinking the shoes he was wearing

502
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
looked very familiar.

503
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,130
Also, one day,

504
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,250
he was lurking around the area

505
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,250
outside of working hours.

506
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,660
He looked suspicious.

507
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,780
So I set up a trap for him.

508
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,010
We waited for him to take the bait.

509
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,420
Hello?

510
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,010
Are you back?

511
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,580
I have a lead on your stalker,

512
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,060
but to capture him in the act,

513
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,730
you'll have to act out a show with me.

514
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,300
This man,

515
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,940
you know him.

516
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,210
Here to extend my parking time.

517
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,370
Okay.

518
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,250
Didn't I tell you? I'm busy.

519
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,060
The password is the same.

520
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,330
The last four digits
of my identification card.

521
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,180
Help me out? Okay.

522
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,370
I deliberately let him
overhear the password to my home.

523
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,060
Excuse me.

524
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,330
I've logged it in. Thanks.

525
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,420

527
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,660
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

528
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,490
Before I return, stay in my place

529
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,700
to avoid any evildoers breaking
into your home.

530
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
Okay.

531
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,090
You had the right idea.

532
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,210
This type of man

533
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,900
would observe
the residents' shoe cabinets

534
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,850
to roughly determine the number
of people living there.

535
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,580
Then, he'll search
for a target he could get to.

536
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,460
No wonder.

537
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,060
My shoe cabinet

538
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,850
only ever held my shoes.

539
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,250
Women living alone

540
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,060
are precisely their target.

541
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,580
Then, the strange shape found

542
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,900
that day on your shoe cabinet

543
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,540
must have been a mark he left behind
on his rounds.

544
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,370
It might be a reminder for him

545
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,210
to know which unit can be broken into.

546
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,370
Good job, kid.

547
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,460
You broke the case nearly
as fast as a police officer.

548
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,300
Your girlfriend won't break up
with you now, right?

549
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,970
Still, you should contact us
in a timely manner

550

and not act on your own.

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,490
Are you still going to break up with me?

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,540

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,970
Let's play Never Have I Ever.

746
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,730
Never Have I Ever.

747
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,780
I think it's a good idea.

748
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,210
Yes.

749
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,780
Let's all play together.

750
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,610
Come.

751
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,090
Never Have I Ever is fun.

752
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,330
I want to play too.

753
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,850
Let's forget about the alcohol.

754
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,130
If we use the app's prompts,

755
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,260
it'll be completely fair.

756
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,020
The loser

757
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,370
will have to do what the app says.

758
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,500
- Come, friends.
- I'm okay with that.

759
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Five lives each.

760
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

761
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,330
I'll go first.

762
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,090
I was once the top boxer
in a boxing championship.

763
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,050
Those who weren't one, lose a life.

764
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,260
Mr. Gu is so amazing.

765
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,610
He's quite amazing.

766
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,900
That's nothing.

767
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,180
I can

768
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,020
tolerate eating fish mint.

769
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,020
What is fish mint?

770
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,610
Have you tried it before?

771
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,500
Not at all.

772
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,020
We'll lose a life each then.

773
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,370
Really?

774
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,220
Really.

775
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,900
I won first place

776
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,660
in a state-level
youth Chinese calligraphy competition.

777
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,050
A champion in the youth competition?

778
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,420
That's quite amazing. You won.

779
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,330
It's okay.

780
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,370
I'm taller than 187 cm.

781
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,700
In a 100-meter sprint,

782
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,050
my time is 12.01 seconds.

783
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,130
I got full marks for math
in my college entrance exams.

784
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,020
I can cook Szechuan, Cantonese,
and Shandong cuisine.

785
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,180
I know how
to make my own hotpot soup base.

786
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,460
I can also
cook Northeastern Chinese cuisine

787
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,570
as well as Thai cuisine.

788
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,500
What can you cook?

789
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,260
Su Zheng, that's really amazing.

790
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,530
Whoever marries you in the future

791
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,770
will be a very happy woman.

792
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,570
I...

793
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,220
I have never dated before.

794
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,610
No way.

795
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,770
Mr. Gu has been single from birth?

796
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,370
I couldn't tell.

797
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,660
I can verify that fact.

798
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,530
He's ridiculously pure.

799
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,020
I have never dated anyone before.

800
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,810
You've never dated,

801
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,940
but he had never held hands with a girl.

802
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,900
Had you?

803
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,740
I did once in kindergarten.

804
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,610
Okay. In that case...

805
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,900
It's fine, Su Zheng.

806
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,090
It's just a game.

807
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,770
Let's see what the punishment is.

808
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,370
It is

809
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,740
to call the one you like

810
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,980
and tell her you love her.

811
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,740
I don't think Su Zheng
has someone he likes,

812
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,220
so let us

813
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,530
change to another.

814
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,700
I have one.

815
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,570
Who is it?

816
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,740
He says he has...

817
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,260
I'll call her right now.

818
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,500
Su Zheng,

819
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,940
how come I never knew
you had a crush on someone?

820
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,460
It's the first time I've heard of it.

821
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,330
Come. Let me see.

822
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,420
My phone is going to die soon.

823
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,330
What are you doing?

824
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,220
- It's the latest model.
- You've never seen it before, right?

825
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,370
It's out of power.

826
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,700
- It's the latest model.
- There's only 1% battery left.

827
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,740
- You can look at it.
- Let me see.

828
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
- No way.
- Everyone, come take a look.

829
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,810
Let's take a selfie.

830
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,460
- Come.
- That's it.

831
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:14,980
It's really going to die.

832
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,020
Strike a pose.

833
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,780
- Yeah.
- Three. Two. One.

834
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,360
Come.

835
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,900
It's dead.

836
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,050
I have a power...

837
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,940
No.

838
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
- I have one.
- You don't.

839
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,900
You don't have one.

840
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,980
I'll rent a power bank.

841
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,900
Move.

842
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,220
- I have a power bank.
- I'll explain later.

843
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,770
That's it for today.

844
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,420
Let's split. It's getting late.

845
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,850
It's almost time. Let's go.

846
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,810
See you next time.

847
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,090
Jiang Junnan

848
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,530
must be very happy.

849
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,130
He's finally not single anymore.

850
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,130
He would definitely
be happy for a while.

851
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,460
Feng Ruru,

852
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,460
what is she like?

853
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,090
I can't say.

854
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,260
Either way, she's not as great as you.

855
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,980
It doesn't matter.

856
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,420
As long as he's happy.

857
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,370
It'll be fine.

858
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,850
Yes. That's right. Cry it out.

859
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,290
You'll be better after a cry.

860
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Xinyi,

861
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,180
I truly understand how you feel.

862
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,460
After all,

863
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,180
I've been through this once.

♪Kept inside with silent hope♪

865
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,180
Was it

866
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,810
Mr. Gu?

867
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,500
How did you know?

868
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,770
When I was staying with you,

869
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,570
I saw the portrait you drew of him

870
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,740
in your closet.

871
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,530
It's all in the past.
No need to mention it.

872
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,570
Still, I think

873
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,420
Mr. Gu likes you.

874
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,330
We are now colleagues.

875
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,850
He thinks of me as a subordinate.

876
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,050
I think of him as a boss.

877
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,660
That's because he hides it well.

878
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,330
Actually,

879
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,020
he has done a lot for you.

880
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,700
- The secret figure from before.
- Stop talking about it.

881
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,740
We're both quite busy now.

882
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,420
I don't have the time to think of this.

883
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,260
I just want to do my job well.

884
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,220
I should learn from you.

885
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,610
I don't want all that emotional stuff.

886
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:56,810
Come.

887
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,530
A toast to ourselves.

888
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,420
Cheers.

Jiang Junnan,

I want to call him,

to tell him

that it hurts inside.

I know it's very hard,

but it'll be fine. I will be with you.

when are we eating?

906
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,810
Just wait a moment.

907
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,770
How much longer?

908
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,420
Is she here yet?

909
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,610
She's coming.

910
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,610
Qianling's here.

Happy birthday, Su Zheng.

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,940
Thank you.

915
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,770
What a cute cake.

916
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,460
In that case,

917
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,570
you can have the girl to eat later.

Okay.

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,530

Didn't you say you would
be here late today?

926
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,050
Today is Su Zheng's birthday.

927
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,330
No matter how busy I am,
I have to be here for cake.
