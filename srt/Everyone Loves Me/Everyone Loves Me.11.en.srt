00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,130
You...

187
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,100
This book

188
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,540
isn't a book many know about.

189
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,220
How did you know of it?

190
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,050
Are you calling me ignorant?

191
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,100
Am I not supposed to be praising you?

192
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,220
Someone said this book
is good for newcomers.

193
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,370
I'm checking to see if it's useful.

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,450
It costs 799!

196
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,810
What are you doing?

197
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,010
I got it first.

198
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,180
Don't you already have a copy?

199
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,100
Well,

200
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
I have a habit.

201
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,050
I'll read one copy

202
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,250
and keep another for my collection.

203
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,660
Give it to me.

204
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,180
Give it to me.

205
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,180
I simply must have two.

Are you crazy?

207
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,180
Don't go overboard.

Thank you.

213
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,300
Hi, do you still have these titles?

214
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,780
I'm sorry. We're out.

215
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,980
Wait.

216

You insist
on antagonizing me, don't you?

217

If you really want to read these books,

I can lend them to you.

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,690
You said it yourself.

However,

222
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,010
I have a condition.

223
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,340
What is it?

224
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,740
You'll drive for me.

225
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,980
Your luggage last time was too heavy.

226
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,450
I hurt my wrist.

227
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,370
The doctor said

228
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,180
I had best avoid straining it.

229
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,100
That's enough to stop you from driving?

230
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,930
I think you need to exercise more.

231
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,340

232
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,930
It's a deal.

233
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,930
It's only driving, right?

234
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,300
A driving license
isn't gotten for nothing.

235
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,010
I'll try out the turning signal.

236
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,490
It's not this one.

237
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,660
This one?

238
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Hey, Sticky.

239
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,690

240
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,780
Turn off the car.

241
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,450
Turn off the what?

242
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,370
Don't turn it off.

243
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,420
The car will automatically power down.

Hurry up.

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,300
Let's go.

249
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,100
Why not...

250
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,050
Why not stop by the side?

251
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,050
I can drive with one hand.

It's called a safe following distance.
Don't you know the rules?

253
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,490

- Brake!
- I know!

Don't look at me. Look at your phone.

265
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,930
I know her.

266
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,780
She's quite popular lately.

267
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,130
Wait. Eyes on the road.

268

It's a red light.

269
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,690
She is quite popular.

This person

274
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,860
seems to be a great fit for Lin Zhi.

275
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,250
It's green.

in the car of Jiangcheng's new racer]

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
What does he mean?

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,050
Is he saying my driving sucks?

282
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
I'll optimize the background then.

283
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,300

285
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,010
I've settled the scheduled issue
with Project Department 1.

286
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,900
Thank you.

287
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,810
It's my duty.

293
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,690
Thank you
for settling the scheduling issues

294
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,930
with Project Department 1's CGGD.

295
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,130
He has promised

296
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,740
to arrange all the work for the morning
if possible.

297
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,220
You'll have to buy a coffee
for Mr. Gu as well.

298
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,570
Mr. Gu?

299
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,690
What is it?

300
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,780
Is there anything else?

301
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,210
Can you look over my draft for me?

302
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,730
Since I drank the coffee you bought,

303
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,420
I'll tell you what you want to hear.

304
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,460
You've improved.

305
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,060
I can sense the character now.

306
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,250
It's not easy

307
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,970
to get a good sense of the character

308
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,060
in such a short time.

309
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,850
I still haven't done it.

310
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,300
It's far from what Fan Xing wants.

311
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,010
I hear that Fan Xing and you

312
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,330
aren't getting along well.

313
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,420
It's normal.

314
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,730
It's all part of a process.

315
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,820
Fan Xing just states the facts

316
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
and speaks based on her skill level.

317
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,010
I think she's great.

318
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,060
I want to reach the standard
where she'll accept my art.

319
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,900
I'll tell you
where you can improve then.

320
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,540
Look at this.

321
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,060
The female lead's weapon

322
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,330
is rather normal.

323
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,330
Actually, when it comes
to Lin Zhi's weapon,

324
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,610
I've tried many types too.

325
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,130
If the weapon is short,

326
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,580
then it doesn't exude a sense
of powerful elegance.

327
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,330
If her weapon is long,

328
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,210
she's powerful and elegant,

329
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,010
but it's rather cumbersome.

330
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,090
If she uses an assassin's weapons,

331
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,900
that just doesn't fit
with her role as a female lead.

332
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,580
I have a suggestion for you.

333
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,090
You can try reading up

334
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,540
on traditional Chinese weapons.

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,420

is giving a talk today.

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,250
The tickets to his lectures
are in high demand though.

338
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,660
You likely can't make it today.

339
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,370
I'll let you know earlier next time.

340
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,180

to study further under you.

What I said before doesn't count.

742
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,660
What's your account name? I'll add you.

743
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,140

744
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,290
Here.

[The Dream of 900 Million Boys]

746
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,130
The Dream of 900 Million Boys?

747
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,090
What a coincidence.

748
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,770
Your username
matches my friend's username.

749
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,810
Still,

750
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,420
you actually set your gender to female.

751
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,900
It's a personal preference.

752
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,700
It's quite special.

753
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,900
It suits you.

754
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,530
What are you doing? Is this revenge?

755
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,900
My hand hasn't fully recovered.

756
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,770
Make sure

757
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,020
to keep your seatbelt buckled.

758
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,500
Thank you.

759
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
This is just...

760
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,740
Xinyi, let me!

761
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,980
The three masks I just bought...

762
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,050
You're amazing.

763
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,770
This one is cool,

764
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,700
right?

765
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,180
Come. Look at the pumpkin heads.

766
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,530
Fan Xing,

767
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,660
do you want to join us in drawing?

768
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,090
I'm not done with work yet.

769
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,940
You guys go ahead.

770
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,530
Okay.

771
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,530
This one's good.

772
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,700
Sure. I'll wear this then.

773
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,220
Let me help you.

774
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,180
This...

775
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,330
Next up,

776
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,180
let's look at the drafts for Lin Zhi.

777
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,770
Okay.

778
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,660
In this version of Lin Zhi,

779
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,050
[Hero's Path: Lin Zhi's Design]
I mainly focused

780
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,760
[Lin Zhi]
on tweaking her weapon.

781
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,580
[Armored State Morph State]

782
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,940
I've made an animation

783
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,660
to showcase to everyone

784
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,500
the chain moves.

785
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,220
Lin Zhi can battle

786
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,610
by swapping between different weapons.

787
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,020
A knife, a sword, and a spear.

788
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,460
Her weapon changes so often.

789
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:57,900
Yes.

790
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,460
In this version of Lin Zhi,

791
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,810
her weapon is made up

792
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,900
of meteorite fragments and silk.

793
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,370
They can form any desired weapon.

794
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,740
[Lin Zhi, Hero 1 (Senluo Morph)]
We have named it

795
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,050
Senluo Morph.

796
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,570
Under normal circumstances,

797
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,330
it's actually wrapped around the arm

798
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,260
like a piece of armor.

799
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,810
Nothing unusual can be seen.

800
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,260
When she enters battle,

801
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,770
it will keep morphing.

802
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,740
It'll scatter into many fragments.

803
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,420
Then,

804
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,330
it can change into various weapons

805
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,660
for her to battle with.

806
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,850
I'm very happy with it.

807
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,570
What does everyone think?

808
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,260
It exceeds expectations.

809
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,770
Mr. Gu?

810
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,810
I have no objections either.

811
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,050
Not bad.

812
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,700
You did well. Keep up the good work.

813
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,530
Mr. Wei.

814
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,850
Other departments display artwork

815
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,020
and murals.

816
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,530
Just what is going on

817
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,610
with your pile of pumpkins?

818
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,050
Mr. Wei,

819
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,980
it's a gesture from all of us.

820
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,090
While it doesn't look especially pretty,

821
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,980
I stained my hands painting it.

822
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,660
Look.

823
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,500
It's hard to draw on.

824
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,050
This isn't your specialty anyway.

825
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,020
I...

826
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,770
Fan Xing,

827
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,370
you once painted on a boulder, right?

828
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,220
You're good at this.

829
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,980
You do it.

830
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,530
I don't have the time.

831
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,940
I still have to work
on the male lead's design.

832
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,570
Yue Qianling,

833
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,290
you do it.

834
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,130
I...

835
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,570
Qianling,

836
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,980
even Fan Xing
has acknowledged your skill.

837
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,980
Why don't you do it?

838
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,130
I just don't have the time.

839
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,420
Your standards are so high

840
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,530
that no matter who you delegate to,

841
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,290
you'll have to approve
of that person first,

842
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,130
right?

843
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,770
I'll get it done.

844
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:10,530
Qianling,

845
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,260
I leave the pumpkin to you.

846
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,850
Here.

847
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,770
- I need a drawing pen...
- This one.

848
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,090
Xinyi,

849
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,130
I need to pop into the break room.

850
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:21,810
I'll get back to this soon.

851
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,530
Okay.

852
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,660
Fan Xing.

853
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,770
I know

854
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,980
you've spent a long time
preparing a design for Lin Zhi

855
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,460
to act as my backup.

856
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,570
Thank you.

857
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,610
No need to thank me.

858
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,610
I didn't do it for you.

859
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,570
