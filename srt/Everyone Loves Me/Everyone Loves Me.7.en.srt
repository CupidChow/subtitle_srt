00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,550
he didn't mean it like that,

191
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,080
right?

192
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Think about it, he might not have...

193
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
Is that so?

194
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,790
In that case,

195
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,440
I will

196
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,270
puncture his tires,

197
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,120
tear up his diploma,

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,790
and smash his suitcase

199
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,480
in front of everyone!

200
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,870
That's weird. This game

201
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,670
doesn't have archers.

202
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,150
If he could do it over,

203
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,600
I believe he definitely wouldn't have...

204
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,840
He surely...

205
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,390
He...

206
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,510
He definitely...

207
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,870
Bro, what's up with you?

208
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm wondering
if I should come clean to her.

209
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,910
If you come clean,

210
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,320
it'll go like this:

211
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,030
Hi.

212
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,910
Gu Xun is Campus Hunk,

213
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,720
and Campus Hunk is Gu Xun.

214
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
I am...

215
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
This will be the consequence.

216
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,240
I don't want to lie to her.

217
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Then talk to her
with your Campus Hunk identity.

218
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,360
Wait until she's not angry,

219
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
and then look for an opportunity.

220
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,030
But if you tell her everything
all at once,

221
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,600
both Gu Xun and Campus Hunk

222
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
will be dead.

223
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,630
So how do you want to die?

224
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,600
In a drunken dream.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,510
Take it easy with the drinking.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
Tell me.

227
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,120
Have my efforts moved no one but myself?

228
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,750
That's not true.

229
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,440
He clearly didn't like me.

230
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,790
Yet I kept throwing myself at him.

231
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,510
No...

232
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,240
You... you've moved me too!

233
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,910
Really?

234
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,840
Stop crying.

235
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,510
Is it because I'm not good enough?

236
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,840
Was I not gentle enough?

237
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,870
How could you think that?

238
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,480
You're great.

239
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,360
You were very gentle!

240
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,840
Going to work every day
was tiring enough,

241
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,440
but I had to get up early,

242
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,910
put on makeup,

243
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,720
dress up,

244
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,870
and speak in a high-pitched voice.

245
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,240
Do you know how gross that was?

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
You shouldn't do that anymore.

247
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,150
Couldn't he just

248
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,240
reject me gently?

249
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,670
I don't owe him anything!

250
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,120
What's his problem?

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,910
Exactly.

252
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,600
Let's not bother with him anymore.

253
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,240
No more contact with him from now on.

254
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,390
Gu Xun, that jerk.

255
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,030
He has no heart!

256
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,030
Stop crying for him.

257
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,000
Xue,

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,270
you're so nice.

259
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,240
I knew you were the best.

260
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,630
See?

261
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,200
Love that grovels is worthless.

262
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,870
Being yourself

263
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,030
is what matters most.

264
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,720
You can't use a hand
that was born to hold a bottle

265
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
to form a hand heart.

266
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,670
Let's drink!

267
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,550
Drink.

268
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,870
Excuse me.

269
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,080
Can I add you on WeChat?

270
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,000
Come...

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
Sit.

272
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
Young man,

273
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,030
let me tell you.

274
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,630
At your young age,

275
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,120
you shouldn't bother
learning pickup lines.

276
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
You shouldn't date either.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,480
It's useless.

278
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,320
I... I just wanted to add you on WeChat.

279
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,120
If it's not okay, just forget it.

280
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm not done yet.

281
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
At a young age,

282
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
you should focus on your career.

283
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
Do you know what it means?

284
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,160
Yes.

285
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
What good is dating?

286
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,510
You'll still get dumped anyway!

287
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,030
But a career?

288
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,240
Your career won't abandon you.

289
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,070
Um,

290
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,720
sorry about that.

291
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,960
She's drunk.

292
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
I guess I should go.

293
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,270
Where are you going?

294
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,480
You want my WeChat, huh?

295
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
Sure, here.

296
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
We can discuss

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,440
the secret of success.

298
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,160
Do you know the first step of success?

299
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,680
Is it

300
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,790
being real?

301
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,310
Exactly!

302
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,200
You've got potential.

303
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,720
Being real.

304
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's drink to that.

305
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,270
- To being real.
- Cheers!

306
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,480
- Cheers.
- To being real!

307
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
To being real!

308
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,960
Speaking of which,
can't that Gu Xun be a bit more real?

309
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,000
Being... I'm so sorry.

310
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,920
Qianling,

311
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,240
you should stop thinking
about that jerk.

312
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,830
Maybe it's karma.

313
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,070
I pretended to be someone else
this one time.

314
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,830
I didn't expect

315
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,550
to face retribution so soon.

316
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,880
Don't talk about yourself like that.

317
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,960
If you're feeling down,

318
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,310
remember, you can always turn to us.

319
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,640
Don't keep it all bottled up.

320
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm really okay.

321
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,030
It's just a love confession gone wrong.

322
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm not that fragile.

323
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,830
It's fine. We all live
in the same city anyway.

324
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,830
Once I've rented a place,

325
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,000
come over to my place to hang out.

326
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
Bye bye.

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Bye bye.

328
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,750
Qianling, good morning.

329
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,550
Morning.

330
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,030
What's with you today?

331
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,070
Why aren't you wearing makeup?

332
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,000
Work's been crazy. I have no time.

333
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,110
Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration?

334
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,000
Does our department

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,110
really have that much work to do?

336
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,440
Speaking of which,

337
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
one of your pieces needs a touch-up.

338
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I've marked it
and sent it to your email.

339
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,480
Okay, I'll get right on it.

340
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,880
Wait a second.

341
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,550
You're not my boss.

342
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,270
I've planned it all out.

343
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,790
As long as we work together,

344
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,200
we can get promoted
to group leader in three months,

345
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,350
and get Jiang Yishi's office
in six months.

346
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,960
And one of us

347

[Becoming CEO in Three Years]
might just become CEO in three years.

348
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,790
I don't want to be that busy.

349
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,310
If I had the time,

350
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,070
I'd rather

351
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,640
experience a few sweet romances.

352
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,510
Oh, I have to tell you something.

353
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,480
I've been chatting
with a cute guy online.

354
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
Look, isn't he handsome?

355
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,640
Just take a look and tell me.

356
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,110
Never mind.

357
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,440
Your meeting today

358
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
is probably going
to be another bloodbath.

[Expense Reimbursement Form]

When he comes clean,

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,030
"bloodbath" won't even begin
to describe it.

362
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,350
Ma'am,

363
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,680
this is my reimbursement form.

364
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,400
Could you stamp it for me?

365
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,590
Just a moment.

Ma'am,

Ma'am, just stamp it and it's done.

Mr. Gu,

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,880
why are you here in person?

for the stationery purchase order.

For such a trivial thing,

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,350
you could have sent someone else.

378
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,790
Ma'am, I was here first.

379
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,310
Mr. Gu, please wait in line.

380
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,400
Thanks.

381
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,160
Mr. Gu!

382
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,920
Your purchase order.

383
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Yue Qianling!

384
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,960
Mr. Gu, what do you need?

385
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,510
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened yesterday.

386
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,790
What about yesterday?

387
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh, yesterday, you rejected me
in front of everyone.

388
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,480
And I've accepted your decision.

389
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,240
From now on, our interaction
will be purely professional.

390
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,200
If you want to talk about work,

391
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,590
contact me through DingTalk first.

392
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,750
No...

393
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,790
Hello?

394
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,680
Did you forget about the meeting?

395
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,440
Everyone else is here.

396
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,200
Stella's here too.

397
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
Hurry up.

398
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,790
Okay.

399
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,720
This is our progress chart

400
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,480
for "The Love Broker".

401
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,070
We plan to release and launch

402
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,110
the game within a year.

403
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,880
Based on our estimates,

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,070
in the first-month post-launch,

405
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,550
we're likely to achieve a profit
of over 150 million yuan.

406
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,960
Within the first quarter after launch,

407
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,640
we expect

408
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,480
to surpass 300 million yuan in profits.

409
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Excellent.

410
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
Your project's just been approved,

411
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,590
and there's already
such a long-term plan in place.

412
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,440
Gu Xun,

413
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,480
could you share

414
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,920
the current progress and plans
for "Hero's Path"?

415
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,880
Since "Hero's Path" started,

416
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,270
we've completed our first-phase goals,

417
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,110
including making the main project plan
and building the programming architecture.

418
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,350
In the next three months,

419
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,270
we'll continue to refine the system,

420
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,640
gameplay, and features,

421
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,550
and we aim to produce
a demo within a year.

422
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,790
Excuse me.

423
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,200
I need to take this.

424
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,400
Mr. Gu,

425
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,790
"The Love Broker"

426
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,400
is laying a solid financial foundation

427
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,310
for "Hero's Path".

428
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,240
We earn the money

429
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,790
for you to spend.

430
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,880
Mr. Jiang, discussing profits
at the start of our projects

431
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,440
might be a bit premature.

432
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,590
After all, you are developing
"The Love Broker"

433
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,310
because the returns of the last project

434
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,880
were modest.

435
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,590
Well, your team's execution
is no better than ours,

436
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,480
and we're just developing mobile games.

437
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,550
Is AAA game development
too challenging for you?

438
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,960
Although there's a gap in workload
and complexity between our projects,

439
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,240
it's understandable
that your department's progress

440
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,640
matches ours.

441
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,400
Making a pie-in-the-sky plan is easy,
but carrying it out is hard.

442
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,550
The half-year profits

443
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,400
of "The Love Broker"

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,750
would take you guys, what,

445
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,480
two or three years to make?

446
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
Mr. Jiang,

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm afraid you guys could never match

448
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
what we accomplish in two years.

449
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,440
The progress chart is already out.

450
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,200
How do you plan to move things forward?

451
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,440
Why the silence?

452
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
The key animation lacks detail,

453
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,480
and the key features
aren't highlighted enough.

454
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,590
Am I right? This afternoon...

455
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,070
Why is Mr. Jiang acting so odd today?

456
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,680
Why is everyone so tense?

457
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Yes.

458
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,920
You can go now.

459
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,590
Go.

460
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,270
Oh, they're coming out...

461
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
Everyone, listen.

462
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
As you all know,

463
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
the most important project
for our department right now

464
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,110
is "The Love Broker,"

465
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,200
so I hope

466
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,680
we can pull together

467
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,200
and set aside other drawings

468
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
that aren't urgent.

469
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,920
But for the last project,

470
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,350
we still have
some holiday special outfits to draw.

471
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,790
Is anyone willing to stick
with the last project?

472
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,790
Anyone?

473
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,640
Alright, I'll give you some time
to think about it.

474
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Come talk to me anytime
if you've decided to do it.

475
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,960
I'll do it.

476
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,590
Great.

477
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,350
Are you sure?

478
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,750
Everyone wants to work
on "The Love Broker".

479
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,310
Why are you choosing the opposite?

480
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,000
Thank you, Ms. Yue, for your dedication.

481
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,240
Make sure to seize this opportunity.

482
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
Good luck.

483
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,480
Have you thought this through?

484
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,510
For a job like this,

485
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,310
if this goes south, it's all on you.

486
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,270
Even if you do well, no one will notice.

487
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,070
How about this? Let's find a way

488
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,590
for you to back out of it.

489
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,270
Principle one of success:

490
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,680
Don't pick and choose tasks,

491
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,270
and don't disdain small tasks.

492
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,880
Back in the day,

493
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,830
neither did the creator of WeChat think

494
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,480
that his product could surpass QQ.

495
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,750
Alright, fine.

496
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,110
Take the job then.

497
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,510
Bro, you've been eating
those three bean sprouts

498
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,400
for over an hour now.

499
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,640
Isn't that Yue Qianling?

500
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,720
Alright, enough with the book.
It's lunchtime.

501
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,960
Nice. We're here off-peak.

502
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,920
It's practically empty.

503
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,440
I wonder if they still have
the dish I want.

504
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,350
Great.

505
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,440
They still have one last serving
of spicy chicken and spicy duck blood soup.

506
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,350
I'll have this, this,

507
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,160
and this.

508
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,200
That's who you've been
thinking about, huh?

509
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,030
What?

510
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,750
Where... Where are you going?

511
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,720
Mind if I join you?

512
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,750
Empty trays go over there.

513
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,480
I didn't get any food.

514
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,440
Well, Mr. Gu, we have plenty here.

515
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,720
Why don't you sit down and join us?

516
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,640
Okay.

517
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Actually, I just remembered

518
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
that there was a file I hadn't saved.

519
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,550
I need to go back.

520
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,310
Wait...

521
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,030
You haven't even taken a bite.

522
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,160
We have cloud documents, don't we?

523
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,550
Don't worry.

524
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,070
If you leave now,

525
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,070
how awkward would it be

526
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,000
for me to be alone with him,

527
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,590
right?

528
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Mr. Gu,

529
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,510
it's not often we see you.

530
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,310
Mr. Gu,

531
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,440
the 9th Business Unit

532
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,510
is our main gossip topic now.

533
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,960
We've always wanted
to know more about you.

534
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,200
Here's a question.

535
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Do you have a girlfriend or something?

536
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
It's not me that's wondering.

537
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,440
It's just that many girls

538
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,550
in our department are curious.

539
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,270
I'm too busy with work
to have time for that.

540
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
So do many girls

541
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,110
profess their love to you or something?

542
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,270
Mr. Gu, why are you looking at me?

543
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,960
Oh, I see.

544
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,480
You're trying to tell me

545
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,750
that girls like me are too ordinary
to profess to you, huh?

546
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,070
Okay, message received.

547
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,310
If I said anything wrong,

548
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,510
feel free to correct me anytime.

549
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,000
What's gotten into you today?

550
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,400
Mr. Gu,

551
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,510
come on. Eat up.

552
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,240
The dishes we picked
are actually quite tasty.

553
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,350
Try some more.

554
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,030
Weird.

555
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,480
Why is today's spicy chicken tasteless?

556
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,270
Mr. Gu,

557
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,790
try the spicy duck blood soup.

558
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
It's extra spicy.

559
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,350
Could you get me...

560
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,640
- I'll go...
- something to drink?

561
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
I'll go...

562
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,270
I'll get a sour prune drink.

563
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,790
What about you?

564
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,550
Same.

565
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,400
Right away.

566
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,270
About yesterday...

567
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,440
About what happened yesterday,

568
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,880
I want to explain.

569
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,030
What happened between us is in the past.

570
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,680
There's nothing to explain.

571
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,030
We can put it behind us
after I tell you this.

572
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,960
Actually, I...

573
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,110
Su Zheng!

574
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,240
Over here...

575
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,550
What a coincidence.

576
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,070
Mr. Gu is here too.

577
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,880
Mr. Gu,

578
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Su Zheng and I need to discuss
some work stuff at Project Department 1.

579
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,070
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

580
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,310
What work stuff?

581
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,750
What...?

582
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,070
I'll let you two talk.

583
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
You and him...

584
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
I saw everything.

585
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
So Yue Qianling
is like this in real life.

586
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,880
Very bold.

587
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,070
Much cuter now.

588
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,000
Finally saw

589
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,310
what Dough Twist is like in real life.

590
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
What did you want to talk about?

591
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,960
I forgot.

592
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,310
Hello?

593
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,750
Is this Yue Qianling?

594
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,070
I'm from the university housing office.

595
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,310
We notified you a week ago
to vacate the dormitory,

596
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,030
but you haven't.

597
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,350
Please move out as soon as possible.

598
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,400
We still need to clean up the room.

599
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,750
I'm so sorry...

600
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,830
I'll move out as quickly as I can.

601
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,640
Make it quick.

602
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,160
I'll leave the task to you then.

603
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,310
I appreciate your hard work.

604
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,480
[Another Win (5)]

605
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,240
[Wheat]
Anyone here?

606
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,480
[Sticky Dough Twist]
Busy with work.

607
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,750
Just had a major facepalm moment.

608
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,590
[Camel]
What happened?

609
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,880
[Sticky Dough Twist]
I ran into that Gu Xun again.

610
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,750
Guess what he did.

611
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,310
[Wheat]
Oh?

612
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,920
Is it that Gu Xun?

613
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,510
[Camel]
What did he do to you?

614
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,310
[Sticky Dough Twist]
He sat opposite me in the cafeteria

615
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,240
and even ate my food.

616
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,880
And he had to drink
the same beverage as me.

617
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,310
[Camel]
That's so creepy.

618
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,200
[Sticky Dough Twist]
I had something I badly wanted to say,

619
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,750
but considering
there were so many people around us,

620
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,000
I held it back.

621
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,070
[Campus Hunk]
What did you want to say?

622
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,310
[Camel]
Oh, you're here too!

623
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,510
[Wheat]
How dare you eavesdrop on us.

624
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,140
[Campus Hunk has muted Camel and Wheat]

625
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,480
[Sticky Dough Twist]
I wanted to tell him

626
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,790
that Dolly the cloned sheep
had six years to live at most.

627
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,160
Young lady,

628
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,680
this apartment was renovated

629
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,510
about seven or eight years ago.

630
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
The furniture is a bit old too.

631
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,640
It's surely not as nice

632
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,750
as the apartment downstairs.

633
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Am I right?

634
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,160
It's a bit older,

635
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,960
but it's cheaper too,

636
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,750
you know?

637
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,510
You get what you pay for.

638
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
The apartment you're looking at

639
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,160
is also mine.

640
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,240
I just rented it out last week

641
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,310
on an annual lease.

642
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,480
Let me tell you.

643
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,550
The tenant

644
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,790
is quite nice.

645
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,110
You have nothing to worry about.

646
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,070
This apartment is cheaper

647
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,110
than the one downstairs, right?

648
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,720
Of course.

649
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,510
But the decor is indeed older
than that downstairs.

650
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,640
That's for sure.

651
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,790
I'll take the downstairs unit then.

652
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,880
Are you sure?

653
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,200
Well, I've brought the contract.

654
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,920
Young lady, you've got good taste.

655
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,270
The feng shui in the downstairs unit
is particularly good.

656
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,790
It's the "peach blossom unit"

657
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,710
of the apartment complex.

658
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,000
Once you move in,

659
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you'll find yourself
out of singlehood soon.

660
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,710
Young lady,

661
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,230
are you seeing someone?

662
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,920
No.

663
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,630
Is there someone you like?

664
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,150
Well...

665
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,230
no, not anymore.

666
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,070
Let me tell you.

667
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,960
Once you move in there,

668
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,710
your love life will bloom.

669
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,440
The guy you like will definitely profess
his love to you,

670
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,670
you know?

671
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,590
Even if you were the one professing,

672
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,320
he'd surely say yes.

673
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,190
Ma'am,

674
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm good.

675
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
I've already fixed my issues

676
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,110
of having poor judgment and bad taste.

677
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,710
Maybe I should just take this one.

678
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,550
That "peach blossom unit"

679
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,840
really isn't for me.

680
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Are you sure?

681
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,710
Shall we sign the contract then?

682
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,320
Yes.

683
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,480
Alright, let's sign the contract.

684
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,030
Annual lease.

685
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,230
Thanks.

686
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,550
Young lady,

687
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,280
you're clever.

688
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,800
Incredibly sharp.

689
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
This apartment really offers

690
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,190
great value for money.

691
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,110
Here... Cheers!

692
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,030
Cheers.

693
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,320
How can I help you?

694
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,400
I'll have a beer.

695
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,840
Okay.

696
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
I thought you'd be very busy

697
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,510
at the 9th Business Unit.

698
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,670
I never expected

699
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,670
you could leave on time.

700
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,110
We are busy,

701
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,840
but we never have to work overtime.

702
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,440
Do you know why?

703
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,710
Why?

704
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,550
Because capable people

705
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,070
don't need to work overtime.

706
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Impressive.

707
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,360
Of all of us who joined the company
through campus recruitment,

708
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
now,

709
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
Wang Hai is...

710
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,070
It's Mr. Wang.

711
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,800
I was wondering why it's so lively here.

712
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Turns out the elites of the class of 2018
are having a gathering here.

713
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,400
Come here...

714
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Isn't this Map?

715
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
What brings you here today?

716
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Hai, why are you guys
at the 9th Business Unit

717
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,630
so mysterious?

718
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,190
What we're doing
at the 9th Business Unit now

719
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
is truly awesome.

720
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,480
In comparison, what we used to work on

721
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,550
was really lousy.

722
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,920
Child's play, almost.

723
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
Really?

724
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,670
Mr. Wang,

725
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,360
show us something then.

726
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah, amazes us.

727
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
That's not possible.

728
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,280
Just let us take a look.

729
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,480
Everyone says the 9th Business Unit

730
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,510
is incredible.

731
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,800
Seeing is believing.

732
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,030
You've got to show us the proof.

733
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,880
Right, Hai?

734
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,030
Exactly.

735
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,280
I can't just show you.

736
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
We've all signed NDAs.

737
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Don't you trust us, Mr. Wang?

738
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,760
- Don't worry.
- Now you're treating us like outsiders.

739
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
Is the 9th Business Unit

740
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,110
all talk and no game?

741
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,400
Is it?

742
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,710
Is it, Hai?

743
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,670
Oh, Map.

744
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,030
You're just like
when you were at school.

745
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,590
Today, I'll show you

746
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,000
what the key animation
created by our unit looks like.
