00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,490
Don't worry.

189
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,780
Leave everything to me.

190
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,050
Will Mr. Gu

191
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,050
defy the higher-up

192
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,370
for an NPC?

193
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,100
Knowing his temper,

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,370
it is very difficult

195
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,370
to change his mind.

196
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,300
If the game is sold,

197
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,610
will the buyer poach Mr. Gu
to continue the game's development?

198
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,980
What will happen to us then?

199
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,570
Hero's Path will never be sold.

200
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,570
Mr. Gu will never give up.

201
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,810
We've experienced
so many things together.

202
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,610
Didn't we solve every problem we met

203
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,130
in the end?

204
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,130
That's because

205
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,300
Hero's Path is more important
to him than anything else.

206
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,740
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

207
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
We should not panic.

208
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,100
I know all of you just want to rant.

209
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,930
It's okay to voice it out.

210
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,130
Our journey to this point
has been difficult.

211
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,050
Let's be patient, everyone.

212
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,930
Excuse me,

213
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,810
has the resident in 402 returned?

214
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,780
He left with his luggage
in the afternoon.

215
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,860
He seemed like he was in a bad mood.

216
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,740
Did he tell you where he went?

217
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,540
He didn't.

218
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,810
I asked him to get the new keycard

219
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,930
but he said there was no need.

220
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,740
Okay. Thank you.

221
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,610
You're welcome.

222
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,740
No need?

223
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,740
Gu Xun said he would return
but he didn't come back.

224
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,370
This is not him at all.

225
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,370
Did something happen to him?

226
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,860
Gu Xun.

227
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,450
Why aren't you picking up?

228
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,010
Where are you?

229
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,450
No matter what happens,

230
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,780
you can tell me.

231
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,930
Don't shoulder everything alone.

232
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,920
[Yue Qianling: Gu Xun.
Why aren't you picking up?]

233
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
[Where are you? No matter what happens]

234
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,620
[You can tell me.
Don't shoulder everything alone...]

235
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,100
Who is this?

236
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,690
Hello.

237
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,050
Hello, Camel.

238
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,490
Do you know where Gu Xun is?

239
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,610
All of us are looking for him.

240
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,780
Are you Dough Twist?

241
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,540
Jiang Junnan also asked me to find him.

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,180
I have heard about the whole thing.

243
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,130
Usually, he will return to his hometown

244
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,610
in this kind of situation.

245
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,340
Did he contact you?

246
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,610
He didn't.

247
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,370
However, he usually stays there
for a few days

248
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,610
when he is in a rough patch.

249
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,180
He'll be fine when he comes back.
Calm down.

250
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm relieved.

251
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,180
I was so worried just now.

252
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,610
However, it feels different

253
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,370
this time.

254
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,420
What do you mean?

255
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,300
Whenever he goes back to his hometown,

256
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,340
he still answers his phone
and replies to messages.

257
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,930
Something's not right this time.

258
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,810
Then he...

259
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,010
Is it possible
that he just wants to be alone?

260
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,300
Gu Xun is someone

261
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,900
who likes to split hairs.

262
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,740
Back in primary school,

263
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
the teacher wronged him.

264
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,660
He felt aggrieved

265
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,340
and stayed in the teacher's office
the whole night.

266
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,610
He almost passed out from starving

267
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,660
when I found him the next day.

268
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,860
I'm not sure if he is
taking things too seriously this time.

269
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
Send me his address immediately.

270
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,660
Give me another bowl to go.

271
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,540
Sure.

272
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,700
What about me?

273
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,580
Stop.

274
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,660
Hurry.

275
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,660
Gu Xun.

276
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,610
Why did you run off alone?

277
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,010
Do you know
that you are the pillar of the team?

278
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,610
What can we do without you?

279
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,730
You didn't even say a word.

280
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,970
You're making me worry.

281
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,850
How could you do that?

282
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,700
You know how much I like...

283
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,700
Qianling.

284
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,330
Why are you here?

285
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,700
Thankfully, I didn't say it out loud.

286
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,060
Otherwise, I would've
embarrassed myself again.

287
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,210
What did you say

288
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,300
just now?

289
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,460
Nothing.

290
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,250
I was scolding you.

291
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,900
Qianling.

292
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,580
It's 7 a.m. now.

293
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,820
There's no high-speed train
at this time.

294
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,420
Did you take an overnight train here?

295
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,460
What do you think?

296
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,420
Did I ride a rented bike here?

297
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,940
How can you be so selfish

298
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,130
and left without saying a word?

299
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,940
Do you know how anxious we were
when we were looking for you?

300
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,850
You are an adult.

301
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,130
Don't vanish without a word.

302
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,780
Didn't I send you a message

303
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,900
that I went home?

304
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,730
You said you went back home.

305
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,900
I thought you went back to our home.

306
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,490
Our?

307
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,370
I didn't specify

308
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,730
and made you worried.

309
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,330
Sorry.

310
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,490
You can return to your hometown.

311
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,850
But why did you switch off your phone?

312
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,370
I didn't bring my charger.

313
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,490
My phone is dead.

314
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,250
Can't you buy a charger?

315
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,850
Is it difficult to buy one?

316
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,210
I...

317
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,490
I've been thinking about you.

318
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,580
I've been trying

319
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,250
to find a special opportunity
to tell you.

320
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,210
The Campus Hunk
used to have a crush on you in the past.

321
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,130
And the current Gu Xun
also has a crush on you.

322
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,970
The last time I asked you
to come to my house,

323
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,250
I actually wanted
to give you a perfect confession.

324
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,420
I even prepared some fairy lights.

325
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,330
However, I couldn't show it to you.

326
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,420
Anyway, the person before you

327
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,250
really likes you.

328
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,540
You look prettier when you smile.

329
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,060
There are two people here
who want to kiss!

330
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,130
I came up with that confession

331
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,780
on the spot.

332
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,900
Was it bad?

333
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,820
I guess

334
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,820
it's all right.

335
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,370
Didn't you say

336
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,090
you wouldn't like me?

337
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,060
You said you would never like me.

338
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,130
You also said

339
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,460
I was not your type.

340
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,540
I didn't know

341
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,900
it was you.

342
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,780
You already knew

343
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,090
that I had always liked you.

344
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,850
I guess

345
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,210
you can say that.

346
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,210
Then,

347
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,060
you said

348
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,940
you liked me a lot.

349
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,780
Can you quantify it for me?

350
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,090
I can't answer

351
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,060
this question.

352
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,490
Wrong answer.

353
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,660
A subjective question like this

354
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,610
does not have a standard answer.

355
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,730
There isn't a reference
to look up to either.

356
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,210
I only know

357
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,210
that I've never liked another girl

358
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,580
throughout my whole life.

359
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,900
You are the only one.

360
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,660

What is he doing?

386

The company crisis is very serious.

How do you plan to solve it?

388
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,460
Look at all these people.

389
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,610
Regardless of what they experienced
the previous day

or how long the night is,

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,330
did you bring your girlfriend back?

395

Yes.

396

Your girlfriend is so pretty.

Thank you.

I've truly become Gu Xun's girlfriend.

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,780
Oh,

400
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,660
how did you find this place?

401
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,580
I was worried about you.

402
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,210
You didn't answer my call
or reply to my messages.

403
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,660
You left without saying a word.

404
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Camel said you would do silly things
when you were alone.

405
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,130
He did it on purpose.

406
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,940
Well,

407
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,540
he told a white lie.

408
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,300
The security guard told me

409
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,580
you left with your luggage.

410
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,660
You didn't even pick up the keycard.

411
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,970
I thought...

412
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,660
You thought I wouldn't go back anymore?

413
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,850
I left in a hurry.

414
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,580
I thought I could ask you
to pick it up for me.

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,900
You scared me.

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,730
How's our team doing?

417
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,250
Jiang Junnan is keeping
the morale afloat.

Everyone is waiting for you
to return with evidence.

419
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,900
I came back

420
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,370
to find clues.

421
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,490
After all,

422
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,210
this is
about the 9th Business Unit's survival.

423
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,820
My father's computer
should still be in his studio.

424
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,780
What we want should still be in there.

425
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,730
Your father's studio?

426
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,090
He had a game studio.

427
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,700
There was a period

428
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,420
when he was living a muddled life.

429
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,940
The studio was everything to him.

Are you all right?

431
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,580
Be careful!

This is cold. Put it on your wound.

433
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,460
Why didn't he explain it to me?

434
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,900
Is that all we can do now?

435
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,460
Mr. Jiang.

436
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,820
You have what we call

437
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,330
the male breakup syndrome.

438
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,420
Three days before the breakup,

439
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,610
you drink, dance, and play games

440
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,580
to enjoy yourself.

441
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,730
A week later,

442
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,490
you will have various...

443
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,420
Isn't it a bit much for him

444
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,250
to do that?

445
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,610
He didn't call me,

446
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,490
send me a text on WeChat,

447
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,370
or apologize to me.

448
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,010
Should I take the high ground

449
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,610
and talk to him first?

450
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,310
It's not my fault.

451
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,370
Why should I do that?

452
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,420
Right, Xinyi?

453
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,090
What a joke. Why should I?

454
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,900
- You are right.
- Seriously.

455
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,300
Not at all!

456
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,130
You were together with Feng Ruru

457
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,250
for one month and four days.

458
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,370
I replied to half of her texts,

459
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,660
said half of the romantic words,

460
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,060
and picked all the gifts.

461
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,610
What did you do

462
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,940
apart from paying?

463
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,700
To be honest,

464
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,660
I'm the one who should feel sad

465

after she broke up with you.

466
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,660
Wait, I...

467
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,420
All you've done is touch yourself.

468
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,610
What she wanted was something basic

469
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,210
but you couldn't even provide
the bare minimum.

470
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,010
In this relationship,

471
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,970
what's the difference between you
and a player who charges money?

472
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,250
Is logging
into the game considered a commitment?

473
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,330
I didn't even ask you to get married.

474
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:18,900
No. I...

everything on my mind?

I suddenly remember

486
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,900
that I still need to finish
the document from this morning.

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,420

I...

495
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,210
I'm having a small fever
and I talked nonsense.

I promise not to do it again.

Do you need help?

There's no need.

you'd get burned.

What is this?

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,660
This is a scene

in the game I want to make.

527
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,970
That's so cool.

528
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,700
I'm sure this is very difficult to make.

Really?

- Of course.
- This studio

534
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,210
used to carry all my father's work.

535
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,460
This is also the first place

536
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,060
where I was exposed to Triple-A games.

537
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,490
Triple-A games didn't exist back then.

538
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,970
I only knew
huge games like this were amazing.

539
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,700
That was when I realized

540
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,540
what my father made

541
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,660

543
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,850
did you argue with Uncle Guo

544
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,210
for that game of yours?

545
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,490
Why do you still develop it
when it's so difficult to develop?

546
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,940
Then...

547
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,490
Let me tell you.

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,970
Sometimes,

549
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,940
it is difficult

to persevere.

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,250
Especially when

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,420
people don't notice

553
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,460

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,490

I'll wait for your call.

559
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,090
- How was it?
- How was it?

560
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,010
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

561
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,090
We did it.

562
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,370
Really?

563
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,780
The company

564
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,900
is interested in our demo.

565
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,730
We are just one step away

566
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,660
from success now.

567
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,900
Dad!

568
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,780
I will always remember the scene

569
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,330
when Dad received his first invitation

570
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,730
from a game company.

571
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,660
So your Triple-A game-developing dream

572
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,500
was inspired by your father.

573
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,900
I'm sure you have
a good relationship with him, huh?

574
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,500
Yes.

575
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,290
He was passionate about his career.

576
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,420
However, compared to his dream...

577
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,180
You didn't go to the parents' meeting.

578
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,330
You didn't go to the planetarium.

579
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,290
What?

580
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,420
Are you trying to make me raise
a child as a single mother?

581
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,500
No.

582
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,050
I didn't miss those dates on purpose.

583
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,570
These few days are very crucial

584
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,980
to my game project.

585
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,610
I can't leave.

586
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,220
Really.

587
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,500
I've decided.

588
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,090
Gu Xun and I are moving

589
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,770
to my parents' place in Qingan.

590
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,740
You are going to leave with our son?

591
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,130
Of course, not.

592
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,370
Qingan's high school

593
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,740
is much better than this place's.

594
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,530
Besides,

595
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,370
our expenses in the future
will only increase.

596
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,900
I want to rent this house out

597
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,530
to cover my expenses.

598
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,810
Then...

599
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,700
Where will I stay?

600
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,020
If you want,

601
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,130
you can follow us.

602
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,500
If you don't,

603
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,460
you can live and die

604
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,900
with your games.

605
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,220
Dad.

606
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,290
Come with us.

607
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,130
You said anything could be solved.

608
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,090
Come here.

609
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,130
Xun.

610
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,810
I want to go with you too.

611
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,940
But...

612
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,220
The game

613
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,530
is not complete yet.

614
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,020
It is very important to me.

615
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,130
Once I complete the game,

616
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,700
I will go and find you and Mom.

617
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,530
All right?

618
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,570
Later, my mother moved to Qingan with me

619
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,900
to live with my grandparents.

620
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,740
My mom

621
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,220
left

622
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,810
the door open for Dad.

623
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,810
Like me, she was waiting

624
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,770
for my father to pick us up.

625
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,530
Later,

626
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,660
we received a call from him.

627
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,740
He said he would succeed soon.

628
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,900
Then, he would be able to pick us up.

629
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,660
I was waiting for that day to arrive.

630
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,290
What happened next?

631
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,940
And then,

632
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,980
my father

633
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,740
had a sudden heart attack

634
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,700
due to overworking

635
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,940
when he was working overtime one night.

636
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,660
He did not make it.

637
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,180
After my father passed away,

638
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,460
this place

639
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,530
was rented by his partners.

640
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,610
It wasn't until I went to university

641
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,460
and started making my own games

642
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,330
that I thought of this place.

643
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,810
The computer and data should be here.

644
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,090
Let's find the evidence.

645
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,050
I can only find
some office supplies here.

646
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,220
What about you?

647
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,610
I can't find anything either.

648
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,700
Do you think

649
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
someone put it aside?

650
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,460
It's possible.

651
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,770
Is it possible

652
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,660
that your mother kept it?

653
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,980
I don't think so.

654
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,850
My mother doesn't like my dad's passion

655
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,050
so

656
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,740
she won't keep

657
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,220
anything related to games.

658
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,980
Then...

659
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,530
Let's talk to Uncle Guo.

660
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,770
Everyone, stop for a while.

661
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,420
Mr. Gu is not here so he can't lead us.

662
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,020
We must take the initiative now.

663
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,740
Copywriting team,

664
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,220
draft a statement.

665
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,940
Apart from the official account,

666
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,090
contact a few content creators

667
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,530
and ask them to share the statement.

668
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,330
Can you do that?

669
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,090
Yes, Mr. Jiang!

670
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,900
Due to the plagiarism allegation,

671
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,700
there are rumors on the internet

672
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,420
saying that we are just

673
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,050
stitching different games together.

674
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,660
They are trying to snowball the issue.

675
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,900
Yi Hong.

676
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,090
Find out the person behind

677
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,090
the account that spreads rumors

678
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,050
and send a lawyer's letter.

679
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,770
All right.

680
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,020
Wang!

681
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,420
Delete all false rumors

682
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,940
to minimize the damage.

683
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,130
No problem, Mr. Jiang.

684
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,090
Su Zheng.

685
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,500
Change the schedule.

686
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,530
The damage is already done.

687
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,180
Yes.

688
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,770
The art team should help out as well.

689
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,220
- All right!
- All right!

690
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,980
All right!

691
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,180
Everyone, get to work!

692
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,460
- Do your best!
- Do your best!

693
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,660
Did you pick yourself up?

694
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,530
I've never admitted defeat.

695
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,220
Camel.

696
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,050
You're here?

697
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,180
Congratulations on becoming a father.

698
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,500
Hello. I am Dough Twist.

699
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,740
What? Were you mesmerized by me?

700
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,220
Hello, Dough Twist.

701
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,130
What a beauty.

702
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,980
Congratulations.

703
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,370
Where is Uncle Guo?

704
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,090
He's over there.

705
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,530
Come.

706
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,700
Done.

707
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,370
It's very fast now.

708
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,050
Sure. Thank you.

709
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,850
Let me know if there's a problem.

710
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,810
Dad, let me carry it for you.

711
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,740
No need.

712
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,610
Uncle Guo.

713
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,330
Gu?

714
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,180
It has been so many years
since I last saw you!

715
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,700
You've grown up.

716
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,460
Your girlfriend?

717
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,370
Yes.

718
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,570
Hello, Mr. Guo.

719
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,050
Hello.

720
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:44,940
How nice.

721
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,500
You are handsome and she is pretty.

722
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,020
Gu,

723
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,220
what are you doing now?

724
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,130
I'm working on Triple-A games.

725
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,050
Gu,

726
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,980
listen to my advice.

727
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,700
Get a normal job.

728
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,810
Your father sacrificed his life

729
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,500
but he ended up with nothing.

730
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,530
Mr. Guo,

731
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,460
times have changed.

732
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,180
Triple-A games can be made.

733
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,220
Besides, we have achieved
some results already.

734
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,810
Yes, Dad.

735
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,500
You are still working

736
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,570
with computers after all these years.

737
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,050
Hush!

738
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Mr. Guo,

739
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,940
we came here

740
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,700
to ask you about something.

741
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,660
My father had a computer in his studio

742
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,940
but when we went there,
we couldn't find it.

743
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,660
Do you know where it is?

744
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,850
There are a few old computers
in the warehouse.

745
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,260
I don't remember

746
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,610
when they were moved here.

747
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,660
I'm not sure

748
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,220
if the one you are looking for is there.

749
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,330
They are over there.

750
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,610
Sir, I've arranged the goods.

751
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,980
Do I need to register?

752
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,500
Dad,

753
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,940
which computer is it?

754
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,090
How would I know?

755
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,810
This is going to take an eternity.

756
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,980
Here. Register your name.

757
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,220
[Group Picture]

758
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,370
Found it.

759
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,050
Dad.

760
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,330
This is the picture you have

761
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,660
inside your drawer.

762
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,740
Yes.

763
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,130
Back then,

764
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,460
your father, I,

765
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,810
and Lu started the company together.

766
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,420
Then,

767
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,770
Lu had an argument with your father

768
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,420
and they stopped talking to each other.

769
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,570
While some perseverance
could be construed as stubbornness,

770
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,740
at that precise moment,

771
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,290
everything was worth it.

772
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,180
Mr. Guo,

773
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,130
I'm sure you thought that way

774
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,610
and persevered back then.

775
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,420
Back then, some game companies

776
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,740
reached out to your father

777
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,260
to buy the copyright to his game.

778
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,180
Of course,

779
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,130
that included copyrights
of some in-game settings.

780
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,700
Was the copyright

781
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,570
sold in the end?

782
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,570
Your father told me

783
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,500
that the deal was closed.

784
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,500
However, he passed away.

785
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,980
I don't know

786
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,420
what happened later.

787
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,290
Gu,

788
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,420
I know better than anyone

789
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,660
how tough making Triple-A titles is.

790
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,290
If you want to pursue this path,

791
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,850
I hope

792
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,130
you can reach the end successfully.

793
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,740
What if...

794
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,020
I'm just saying what if.

795
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,700
If your father did sell the copyright,
what would you do?

796
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,500
Regardless,

797
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,260
I need to know

798
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,260
who owns it.

799
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,530
Stella bought us three days.

800
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,850
I need to fight
for the 9th Business Unit's future.

801
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,460
I'm sure we can do this together.

802
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,460
Besides,

803
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,610
I created this character

804
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,020
together with my father.

805
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,570
It's

806
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,090
our only connection.

807
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,370
I don't think he would sell it
that carelessly.

808
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,810
Lin

809
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,420
is the mentor of the main character

810
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,740
in the storyline.

811
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,090
In the game,

812
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,610
the main character finds him

813
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,940
under the starry sky.

814
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,260
Two distant stars

815
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,570
crossed paths there.

816
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,090
I guess

817
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,850
you are trying to make up for the regret

818
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,090
of not being able to go

819
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,700
to the planetarium with your father.

820
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,090
Yes.

821
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Alas,

822
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,740
there will always be regrets in life.

823
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,370
Are you thirsty?

824
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,740
Do you want some water?

825
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,290
Thank you.

826
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,660
You're welcome.

827
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,220
Do you want some?

828
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,420
Thank you.

829
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,500
You're welcome.

830
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,660
Do you think

831
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,130
we are

832
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,420
being too formal with each other?

833
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,610
A little.

834
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,370
Then,

835
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,610
what should we do with that?

836
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,460
Perhaps

837
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,850
I can be cheekier?
