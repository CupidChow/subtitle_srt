The interaction between the promo

171
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,300

Don't overthink it.

Why isn't he here yet?

182
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,020
He must have been held up by work.

183
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,860
That's just how he is.

184
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,460
Should I send him a message?

185
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,420
No, that would seem too eager.

190
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,230
Do you think it's still possible

191
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,620
to change the promo now?

192
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,310
You want to add interactive elements?

193
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,020
Maybe just add one at the end?

194
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,430
One isn't enough.

195
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,430
The interaction between the promo
and the game itself

196
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,990
is something I hadn't considered.

197
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,750
It's given me some inspiration.

198
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,870
I think the promo of "Hero's Path"

199
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,230
could be better.

200
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,940
It's releasing tomorrow.

201
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,380
There's no time.

202
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,190
Besides, our main competitor
is Project Department 1.

203
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,940
Their alpha test will definitely proceed
as scheduled tomorrow.

204
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,110
If we don't release our promo on time,

205
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,020
they'll get the prime spot
at the Games Expo.

206
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,060
Then all the hard work

207
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,550
of the entire 9th Business Unit
for all this time

208
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,620
will have been in vain.

209
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,580
Our show is about to start.

210
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,020
Please hurry up and come inside.

211
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,140
Is he standing me up?

212
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,190
Stand me up then.

213
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,820
Why should I care?

214
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,190
But

215
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,580
he asked me out first.

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,060
Why doesn't he show up?

217
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,870
Hello, mom.

218
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,550
What exactly did Gu Xun tell you?

219
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,580
Is he coming or not?

220
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,700
Be patient.

221
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,460
He must have been held up at work
with last-minute tasks.

222
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,550
It's understandable.
Just wait a bit longer.

223
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,790
If he's busy with work,

224
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,230
he could at least call me.

225
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,700
How could he ask me out
and just stand me up like this?

226
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,230
Gosh, I'm running out of time.

227
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,380
I have a date.

228
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,550
Don't think too much about it.

229
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,460
Let's call it a day.

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,700
Mom,

235
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,430
are you sure your friend's daughter

236
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,260
is in AI?

237
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,430
Yes,

238
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,940
her mom said
she was in the same field as you.

239
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,260
In that case,

240
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,910
is her mom's surname Ju?

241
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes, why?

242
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,060
Are you not there yet?

243
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm on my way now.

244
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,350
Those who haven't entered,
please hurry. This way.

245
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,460
Looks like
I got the wrong message again.

246
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,700
Hey, Sticky.

247
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,550
I'm here.

248
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,870
Call Yue Qianling.

249
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,110
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

250
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,870
Hey, Sticky.

251
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm here.

252
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,620
Call Yue Qianling.

253
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,310
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

254
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,350
Hey, Sticky.

255
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm here.

256
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,140
Call again.

257
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,190
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

258
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,020
Qianling.

259
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,790
Qianling,

260
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,140
why didn't you answer my calls?

261
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,670
I've been calling you.

262
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,620
Where were you earlier?

263
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,940
I was at the office.

264
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,110
- No need to explain.
- Let me explain.

265
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,990
I get it.

266
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,380
Qianling.

267
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,110
- Stop following me!
- Qianling.

268
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,260
What a stupid door.

269
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,380
I...

270
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,460
This is just my luck.

271
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,820
Can you

272
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,310
lend me a power bank?

273
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,870
I need to call a locksmith.

274
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,620
It's pretty late.

275
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,910
How about

276
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,620
staying at my place tonight?

277
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,060
No, thanks.

278
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,940
Hey.

279
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,550
Get me a toolbox as well.

280
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,310
This...

281
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,020
Qianling,

282
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,700
it's an electronic lock.
It's quite complex.

283
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,620
These tools

284
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,380
might not do the trick.

285
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,140
Qianling,

286
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,260
maybe you should just stay
at my place for tonight.

287
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,550
- It's an electronic...
- Hello?

288
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,500
Hi!

289
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,580
Sir.

290
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,350
Sir, can you come now?

291
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,820
Yes, now.

292
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,060
Extra charge?

293
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,580
You might as well rob me!

294
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,380
Extra charge, huh?

295
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,140
Fine.

296
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,380
No problem.

297
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,350
Whatever it costs.

298
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,380
Now,

299
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,350
get here

300
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,700
immediately!

301
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,350
You've got a strong kick there.

302
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,350
Clearly, a man did this.

303
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,140
Young man,

304
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,230
did you do this?

305
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,620
You should make him pay for the damage.

306
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,550
It's my fault.

308
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
Miss,

309
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,430
he's apologizing to you.

310
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,430
Tell him

311
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,380
I can't accept that.

312
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,500
Young man,

313
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,020
she says she can't accept that.

314
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,620
I heard.

315
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,990
He says he heard you.

316
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,670
Are you two...?

317
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,140
- Fix the lock!
- Fix the lock!

318
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,430
Okay.

319
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,990
With this damage,

320
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,550
it won't be a quick fix.

321
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,380
It's going to take a while.

322
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,140
Qianling,

323
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,990
it's getting late.

324
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,940
Maybe you should just come to my...

325
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,700
Sir!

326
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,500
No matter how late,

327
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,580
I want to return to my own home tonight.

328
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
But it's...

329
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,350
I'll pay whatever it costs!

330
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,190
Okay.

331
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,700
Done. Please come in.

332
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,020
Qianling!

333
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,860
Is it your thing

334
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,950
to stand at someone's door
in the middle of the night?

335
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
No, I...

336
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,220
Stop arguing.
I still need to check the lock.

337
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,340
What are you doing?

338
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,070
Don't make me call security.

339
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,430
You should at least give me a chance
to defend myself

340
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,620
before convicting me.

341
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,980
Okay, miss,

342
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,220
it's fixed.

343
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,140
Remember to pay online.

344
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,100
Young people today

345
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,310
really know how to have fun.

346
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,140
Get out.

347
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
Get out!

348
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,740
Sir!

349
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,980
Sir!

350
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,740
Don't leave! The door's not fixed yet!

351
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,430
Sir!

352
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,860
What are you looking at?

353
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,910
Turn around.

354
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,830
Hello, sir.

355
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,620
Can you come back tonight?

356
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,140
You left without fixing the lock.

357
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,380
Yes, tonight.

358
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,620
What?

359
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,950
You can't come back
until tomorrow morning?

360
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,910
That won't do, sir. Tonight I must...

361
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,670
Hello?

362
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,790
Hello?

363
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,670
How can he do this to me?

364
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,220
He said he couldn't come
until tomorrow morning.

365
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,220
Okay.

366
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Okay?

367
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,020
I don't think it's okay at all.
What part of this is okay?

368
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,190
It's not okay.

369
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,100
You,

370
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,020
turn around.

371
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,620
Okay.

372
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,910
Actually, there's
no essential difference

373
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,500
between staying at my place and yours.

374
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,260
There is.

375
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,980
Essentially,

376
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,910
I don't want to see you tonight.

377
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,310
Qianling,

378
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,340
please let me...

379
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,070
Standing you up was my...

380
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,070
No, I...

381
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,340
Are you done?

382
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,190
I don't want to listen to you.

383
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,220
I don't want you to go to bed upset.

384
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,430
You...

385
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,710
You don't

386
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,740
have to do this.

387
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,590
Can I

388
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,950
talk to you now?

389
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,070
Get up.

390
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,860
Talk after you get up.

391
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,670
So this is what she falls for.

392
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,070
What did you say?

393
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,790
Nothing.

394
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,220
I said you're beautiful and kind.

395
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,500
What do you want to say?

396
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,860
I'm going to bed after this.

397
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,550
Yue Qianling,

398
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,950
I honestly didn't know

399
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,100
the person my mom
was setting me up with was you.

400
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,980
When I found out,

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,140
I swear,

402
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,020
I wanted to rush over immediately.

403
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,740
But,

404
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,790
just my luck, I got held up.

405
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,550
I couldn't get through
to your phone either.

406
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,830
I know all this
might sound like excuses.

407
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,070
But the timing
was just that unfortunate.

408
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,260
You...

409
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,830
you wouldn't hear me out,

410
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,790
so I came up with that foolish move.

411
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,790
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,950
I thought

413
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,020
the stand-up comedy show

414
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,790
was about fulfilling the bet.

415
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,100
That's why I cared about it so much.

416
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,310
It wasn't.

417
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,550
Then...

418
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,710
if you knew it was me,

419
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,590
would you have come?

420
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,470
Yes.

421
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,710
What's wrong?

422
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,670
I feel wronged.

423
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,020
Why do you feel wronged?

424
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,670
You wouldn't understand.

425
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,620
Even if I told you, you wouldn't get it.

426
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,380
I'm going to freshen up.
Don't mess up my house.

427
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,500
Wait.

428
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,140
Could you grab me a piece of clothing?

429
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,620
What?

430
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,140
You can't fit into my clothes.

431
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,380
You're not into that, are you?

432
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,220
I...

433
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,620
I don't have that kind of fetish.

434
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,100
Didn't I leave some of my clothes here?

435
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,070
They're in the bedroom closet.

wash my clothes too?

477
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,070

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,310
Kind of.

479

What's up?

480
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,670
Tell me.

481
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,740
The promo isn't perfect yet,

482
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,100

Wait a bit.

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,140
Let's get straight to the point.

497
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,070
"The Love Broker" is currently
in alpha testing.

498
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,380
We'll soon
get real feedback from players.

499
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,220
This time,

500
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,710

502
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,830
Sorry, everyone.

503
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,830
I have made a very important decision.

504
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,830
The promo video's release
will be delayed.

505
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,550
[The 9th Business Unit]

HC Game

509
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,910
has become a joke on the trending list.

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Why did he delay

511
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,070
the promo release just like that?

512
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,100
Isn't Mr. Gu's decision

513
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,790
wasting

514
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,500
everyone's efforts?

515
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,790
Yeah,

516
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,830
everyone's saying
we went back on our word.

517
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,670
They're all criticizing us.

518
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,740
What's the use
of all these plans I've made now?

519
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,550
I can't help but say this:

520
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,710
can "Hero's Path" respect its players?

521
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,710
Isn't this deception?

522
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,260
Where's the promo?

523
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,310
Can someone tell me why it got delayed?

524
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,380
I hope to have another five days.

525
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,070
I will deliver a brand-new promo video

526
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,100
for your review.

527
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,340
Do you think this is child's play?

528
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,620
When you

529
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,140
first joined the company,

530
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,860
the contract clearly stated

531
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
that you must produce

532
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,430
a game within three years.

533
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,430
Now it's been a year,

534
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,980
and you can't even finish a promo video.

535
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,340
Today,

536
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,980
in front of the directors,

537
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,670
I suggest we discuss

538
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,140
terminating this project.

539
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,020
Actually,

540
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,910
I can understand Mr. Gu's intentions.

541
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,550
"Hero's Path" aims to match

542
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,620
the quality
of outstanding international AAA titles.

543
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
If

544
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,860
the promo isn't good enough,

545
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
it's better not to release it.

546
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,950
I understand,

547
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,670
but

548
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,190
what should we do now?

549
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,790
I understand
the challenges you're facing.

550
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,380
But you must also see things
in our shoes.

551
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,740
As shareholders,

552
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,980
we need to prioritize the interests
of the corporation.

553
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,550
This is not a game.

554
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,670
I assure you, directors.

555
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,830
"Hero's Path"

556
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,430
will be launched within two years.

557
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,590
Give me five days,

558
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,710
and I will
give you a satisfactory promo.

559
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,220
And if you can't?

560
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,190
I will take full responsibility.

561
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,980
Okay.

562
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,100
I'm sorry

563
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
for making everyone work so hard
these days.

564
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,310
I've decided not to release the promo

565
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,220
because I believe

566
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,550
we can do better.

567
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,470
Our previous efforts won't be wasted.

568
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,140
We just have to work harder

569
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,310
for a bit longer.

570
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,670
Guys, you've had a hard day's work.

571

I need to head back to pick up some stuff.

575
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,380
I can give you a lift.

576
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Let's relax a bit.

577
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,830
How about a brain teaser?

578
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,380
Sure.

579
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,620
I could use a laugh.

580
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,620
Listen up.

581
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,620
A cake fell over.

582
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,910
Who can make it stand back up?

583
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,620
A pig,

584
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,320
because it's a "chocolate cake."

585
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,220

in Chinese]

586

Wow, you're smart.

587

Your question bank seems
a bit elementary, don't you think?

588
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Here's another one.

589
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,790
Why can't airplanes crash into stars?

590
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,020
Because stars twinkle.

591
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,070
You have such a broad range
of knowledge.

592
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,910
Have you heard about the once-popular

593
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,220
Cold Joke Club on campus?

594
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,470
Jiang Junnan was the president.

595
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,710
All I heard was that the club folded
in less than two months

596
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,070
due to a lack of members.

597
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,190
A lack of members?

598
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
There were only two.

599
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,590
Is the other one...?

600
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,260
I was coerced into it.

601
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,590
I was the honorary vice president.

602
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,470

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,620
would definitely
be crying their eyes out now.

605
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,620
I'm trying to comfort you here,

606
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
and this is how you repay me?

607
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,670
You're comforting me?

608
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,830
Can't you tell?

609
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,860
Let me think of another way.

610
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,470
Is it that hard? You're taking so long.

611
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,830
Here, here.

612
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,310
Don't worry.

613

This won't do.
I must ask Gu Xun to eat something.

614

Why are the lights out?

615
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,910
Working on the promo
must have exhausted him.

616
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,230
I should help him.

[Interview with Famous
Game Producer Alex]

619
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,540
How about this?

620
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,100
How about we add

621
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,380
interactive elements
at pivotal moments in the promo

622
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,540
to branch off into side stories?

623
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,190
This could set the stage
for the main narrative.

624
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,710
There's too much content.

625
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,060
We can't finish all the side stories.

626
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,430
I have an idea.

627
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,990
In the promo,

628
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,780
I want to convey the idea

629
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,510
that when Lin Zhi faces the final boss,

630
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,030
killing it to protect humanity

631
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,860
isn't the only choice.

632
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,060
She could also let it live
after defeating it,

633
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,060
achieving a world
where humans and beasts coexist.

634
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,060
Just as our Chinese civilization

635
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,820
is inclusive and adaptive,

636
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,860
humans and beasts

637
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,100
can live together

638
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,140
in a world of harmonious coexistence.

639
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,910
That's good.

640
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,910
It is.

641
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,300
Then,

642
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,140
we can make a change

643
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,750
to the end of the promo video,

644
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,580
freezing the scene at the moment

645
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,710
before Lin Zhi launches the final attack
on the beast.

646
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,670
This not only demonstrates

647
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,140
the spirit of "Hero's Path"

648
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,190
but also leaves suspense
for the players.

649
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,910
Also,

650
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,100
since we can find easter eggs

651
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,060
in the promo,

652
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,230
can we also

653
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,820
make something

654
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,100
that gets more people interested

655
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,300
and even voluntarily participate
in the promotion?

656
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,140
Sure.

657
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,380
Have you played

658
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,190
one of those addictive little games

659
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,470
where sharing gets you items?

660
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,060
I often stay up all night playing them.

661
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,860
This idea can work.

662
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,580
Let's create a simple addictive game
with a counterintuitive trap

663
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,380
and a mischievous nature

664
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,060
to quickly engage players.

665
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,620
Nice.

666
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,780
We can make a side-scrolling game

667
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,580
where the cartoon version of Lin Zhi
fights against the beast.

668
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,430
It'll be similar to the classic NES game

669
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,860
where the plumber jumps
and hits mushrooms.

670
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,710
Just simple controls

671
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,230
like jumping and attacking.

672
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,470
We can also
set up three initial revival chances.

673
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,990
But if you share the game
with a few friends,

674
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,670
you'll get one more chance,

675
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,190
up to a maximum of five chances.

676
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,270
If you clear the game,

677
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,820
you get a limited-edition skin.

678
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,620
That works.

679
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,710
It promotes the game

680
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,030
and also helps to draw in new players.

681
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,060
What do you guys think?

682
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,750
- Sounds great.
- Very good.

683
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,430
I think it's a great idea.

684
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,620
If we go ahead with this game,

685
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,380
the pressure will be
on the concept art group.

686
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
But, Mr. Gu,

687
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,820
this might affect

688
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,580
the progress of "Hero's Path."

689
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,510
They're already overworked.

690
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,190
I'd love to try,

691
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,990
but I have no experience.

692
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,820
Would they agree if I offered?

693
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,380
Let me give it a try.

694
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,510
I've had some experience
with concept art before.

695
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,820
It shouldn't be a problem.

696
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,950
Good.

697
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,190
You'll be in charge then.

698
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,230
See if anyone else can help

699
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,470
and let them join you.

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,580
Don't worry.

- Go for it.

The overall setting of "Hero's Path"

706
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,540
is pretty much like this.

707
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,430
We'll follow this direction.

708
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,510
Prepare a cartoon version of Lin Zhi.

709

I don't have any urgent tasks
at the moment anyway.

713

Interested in concept art, are you?

714
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,270
Actually,

715
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,380
I was thinking

716
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,340
of giving you the task of designing
the limited-edition weapons.

717
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,780
Really?

718
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,950
You were the designer of Senluo Morph.

719
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,430
I believe you can do it.

720
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,380
You can trust me!

721
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,750
Let's take a look at this...

722
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,950
Gu Xun's idea is truly brilliant.

723
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,990
If they really pull it off,

724
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,270
what should we do about our booth?

725
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,300
Keep on with your preparation.

726
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,620
They've got a tight timeline,
huge challenges, and limited manpower.

727
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,510
They can't possibly make it.

728
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,580
Even if they do,

729
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,340
we have a backup plan.

[Collectible Han Sword]

731
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,030
It's not doable.

732
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,670
Why not?

733
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,620
Zhao and Mr. Wei

734
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,750
have already approved the design.

735
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,710
Do you think a good look
is all we need?

736
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,950
Of course not.

737
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,230
The perspective, proportion,
lighting, and rendering.

738
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,030
I've refined them all.

739

What material

742
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,780
is this sword made of,

743
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,140
bronze or iron?

744
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,670
Iron, I guess.
