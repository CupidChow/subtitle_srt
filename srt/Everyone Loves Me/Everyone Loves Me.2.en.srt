00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,140
they were very popular.

192
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,780
How could he say

193
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,260
that he reluctantly agreed to take over?

194
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,730
Before you came,

195
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,780
he kept drawing at his desk

196
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,820
without even going to the toilet.

197
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
He is waiting

198
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,260
to surpass you.

199
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,460
There was no friendship after I left.

200
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,580
Perhaps he is still

201
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,410
badmouthing me behind my back.

202
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,020
Did you all hear this?

203
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,380
What?

204
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,260
Yue Qianling is coming back!

205
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,020
She left yesterday

206
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,050
and regrets it today.

207
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,460
I was upstairs getting my check

208
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,650
and the bosses were talking about this.

209
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,260
Our boss was so angry

210
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,940
that he went mad.

211
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,970
They said Yue Qianling
was treating this place like a market

212
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,290
where she could
come and leave as she pleases.

213
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,260
The company doesn't need her.

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,170
Does she think she is

215
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,380
a big shot
who could make billions from users?

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,490
In my opinion,

217
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,730
young people nowadays

218
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,650
are too impatient.

219
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,970
They always think
about immediate success

220
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,050
and have unrealistic dreams.

221
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,900
You still need to be capable at least.

222
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,090
Mr. Yin.

223
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,220
What?

224
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,340
Qianling?

225
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,050
Did you return so soon?

226
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
The boss

227
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,580
was only throwing a tantrum.

228
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,220
You know

229
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,170
his personality.

230
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't take it to heart.

231
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,970
Welcome back.

232
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,970
Do your best.

233
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
As expected

234
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,220
of Mr. Yin.

235
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,140
You can still chat so casually

236
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,410
when you have
four characters on your hands.

237
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,780
I must do my best
to replicate your mentality

238
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,290
in my life.

239
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,140
But Mr. Yin,

240
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
you should take care of your health.

241
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,090
After all,

242
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,900
you are still
thinking about immediate success

243
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,460
after you graduated for so many years.

244
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,170
You...

245
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,650
Mr. Yin,

246
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,780
the characters we launched today

247
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,490
have bugs.

248
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,340
What?

249
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,410
The characters appeared in a T-pose.

250
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,020
Troubleshoot it.

251
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,900
What's going on?

252
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,020
- I don't know.
- How did it happen?

253
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,410
Didn't we just release it today?

254
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,290
Didn't we troubleshoot it already?

255
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,290
Didn't we write it yesterday?

256
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,460
I tried many times.

257
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,730
There's not supposed to be a problem.

258
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,850
What's wrong?

259
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,900
Mr. Jiang,

260
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,170
the new characters are in a T-pose.

261
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,610
There's a 7% chance for it

262
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,610
to occur in the game.

263
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,410
We are troubleshooting it right now.

264
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,460
A situation like this usually occurs

265
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
when the safety software in a computer

266
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,170
- gets deleted by cleaning software.
- What can we do?

267
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,900
The movement

268
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,780
became a T-pose during modeling.

269
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,090
Got it.

270
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,220
It has been restored.

271
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,700
It's fine now.

272
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,170
It scared me.

273
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,530
Leader, I also found a bug here.

274
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,260
What's wrong?

275
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,700
How is it?

276
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,140
Take a look.

277
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,090
I don't know.

278
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,970
The computer is stuck.

279
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,290
How did this happen?

280
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,220
How do they solve it?

281
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,090
I don't know.

282
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,380
[#New character on "Miracle Kid"
launched with a bug#]

283
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,180
[I refuse to struggle with T-pose.
New characters can T-pose as well]

284
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
[I can't help
but laugh at the weird T-poses]

285
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,850
The news spreads quickly
on the internet.

286
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,700
I can use it.

287
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,580
I don't think so.

288
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,850
It's normal to have bugs.

289
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,900
Just fix it.

290
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,260
Leader, the bug is stubborn.

291
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I can't fix it alone.

292
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,820
Fix it quickly. How is it stubborn?

293
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,730
I can't fix it alone.

294
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,260
It can be fixed.

295
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,050
Hurry.

296
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,580
- Fix it.
- The computer froze.

297
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
- Fix it quickly.
- It's really tough.

298
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,380
It's not difficult at all.

299
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,090
Just fix it quickly.

300
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,050
I've never seen this before.

301
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,220
Let me try it.

302
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,090
Who is that guy?

303
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,260
Gu Xun.

304
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,820
Where is your server?

305
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,220
- Over there.
- There.

306
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,580
Do you have a pair of tweezers?

307
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,290
Yes.

308
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,380
As expected.

309
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,820
A real bug.

310
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,020
Grace Hopper

311
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,170
who programmed the Mark II

312
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,380
found a glitch

313
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,340
while adjusting the equipment.

314
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,530
She took a long time to find the cause.

315
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,340
Later, she found a moth

316
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,490
stuck between two contact points

317
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,410
after opening the relay

318
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,340
which caused the bug.

319
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:03,940
I see.

320
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,700
The chance of this occurring
in the system

321
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,460
is 0.01%.

322
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,650
Awesome.

323
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,290
Amazing.

324
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,090
You got lucky.

325
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,820
I know him. He is

326
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,090
the new developer
from the 9th Business Unit,

327
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,780
Mr. Gu.

328
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,460
That's him?

329
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,820
That's right. It's him.

330
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,380
No wonder.

331
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,970
He is Mr. Gu?

332
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,170
No wonder
he became the department's leader

333
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,460
at such a young age.

334
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,650
He's great.

335
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,220
Yes. I also want to join his department.

336
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,530
All of you talk a lot.

337
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,220
Get to work!

338
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,220
Get to work.

339
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,020
Hello.

340
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,530
Qianling,

341
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,090
if you want to come back,

342
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,700
it might be difficult.

343
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,260
I know, Yin.

344
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,340
However, the cards I drew previously

345
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,610
haven't been confirmed yet.

346
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,820
The New Year event will begin soon

347
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,170
so I still want to fight for it.

348
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,730
You should know

349
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,700
that gamers like the cards I draw.

350
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,050
Of course, I know that.

351
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,410
However, you also know

352
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,610
that the boss doesn't care

353
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,090
about an intern illustrator.

354
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,490
I think

355
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,290
I'm not in a place to mention it again.

356
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,020
I understand.

357
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,610
Thank you, Yin.
Sorry for causing trouble.

358
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,970
Yin?

359
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
What did she say?

360
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,900
That's not important.

361
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,850
I'm telling you.

362
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,050
I've decided.

363
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,970
I'm going

364
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,140
to submit my resume.

365
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,940

366
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,290
I'm willing to work for any company.

367
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,380
Are you okay?

368
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,380
Are you going to fight to the death

369
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,340
over someone like Yin Jun?

370
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,730
It's not necessary.

371
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,580
No.

372
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,700

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,940

562
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,460
in revenue.

563
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,890
Are you the Technical Artist
of "Death of Darkness"?

564
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,460
After I graduated abroad,

565
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,770
I stayed there.

566
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,460
I stayed for seven years
and decided to return to the country.

567
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,580
I can see that you've been working
with this game genre.

568
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,770
I want to come out of my comfort zone.

569
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,130
That is why I came to HC.

570
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,740
If I can stay here,

571
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,290
I will prove my mettle with my results.

572
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,620
All right.

573
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,700
I look forward

574
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,410
to a more innovative product
from you at our company.

575
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,650
Thank you.

576
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,650
I've heard a rumor about you.

577
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,740
It says that you learned

578
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,890
from a mysterious teacher abroad.

579
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,370
While creating "Death of Darkness",

580
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,050
you've modded Unity 3D.

581
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,650
We customized the whole engine

582
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,890
without sleeping.

583
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,890
We rewrote everything

584
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,740
from rendering channels,

585
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,700
texture systems,

586
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,250
and special effects performance.

587
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,130
What a coincidence.

588
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,170
I've also been
optimizing the engine recently.

589
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,250
Why don't we

590
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,340
try it together?

591
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,650
Sure!

592
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,450
We have the lead planner, Wang Hai,

593
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,940
and lead programmer, Yi Hong now.

594
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,100
We are only lacking a lead artist.

595
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,620
Yes.

596
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:28,980
Got it.

597
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,050
I'll go look for one.

598
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,620
[Chen Yin]

599
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,340
Sorry.

600
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,010
It's all right.

601
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:36,890
Last week,

602
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,820
I saw you posted the Chinese-style work

603
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,370
on the internet.

604
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,410
It really suits our...

605
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,770
Sorry.

606
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,170
[Chen Yin]

607
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,130
Well,

608
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,050
my mother called me.

609
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,370
Perhaps there is an emergency.

610
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,820
Please let me answer the call.

611
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,940
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

612
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,500
Hello, Qianling.

613
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,620
Didn't you say you wanted
to return to the company?

614
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,580
Let me tell you.

615
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,770
Yue Qianling.

616
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,620
Mr. Jiang.

617
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,650
Come back to the company immediately.

618
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,530
There will be a 3,000 yuan increase
in your base salary.

619
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,940
Remember one thing.

620
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,500
There can be no problems
with the New Year cards.

621
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,700
Sure. I'll go back immediately.

622
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,370
Sorry.

623
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,130
My mother asked me
to go on a blind date.

624
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,940
She wants me to get married this year

625
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,530
and give birth to a child next year.

626
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,700
She wants a second child
the next year as well.

627
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,860
I'm afraid I don't suit
your company's requirements.

628
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,890
Thank you.

629
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,860
We can discuss

630
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,130
your salary, benefits,
and maternity leave!

631
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,100
Miss, why did you hit me?

632
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,370
My head!

633
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,170
Are you all right?

634
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,650
You eat a lot normally.

635
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,940
Seriously.

636
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,860
I'm so tired.

637
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,340
Which teacher made us

638
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,100
do lion dancing during sports?

639
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,050
I'm going to give him
the Four Great Inventions award.

640
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,050
It's so tiring.

641
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,250
I heard that a make-up exam
is stricter than a normal exam.

642
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,010
No way.

643
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,370
Can I pass the exam?

644
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,010
That student
who is in charge of the lion head!

645
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,050
You need to move the head.

646
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,740
Don't just move your butt.

647
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,250
All of you must practice well.

648
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,500
If you can't pass the make-up exam,

649
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,620
don't come and find me while crying

650
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,050
- when you can't get your certificate.
- Gu Xun.

651
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,410
Stop hiding.

652
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,170
You need to use this opportunity

653
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,940
to change his impression of you.

654
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,620
You can't be the snake forever.

655
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,890
You are right.

656
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,890
Practice more from now on!

657
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,940
Can you do it?

658
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,170
Of course, I can. Come on!

659
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:57,980
Continue.

660
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,580
Go on.

661
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,130
What are you waiting for?

662
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,620
I have an idea.

663
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,340
Look.

664
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,980
Instead of both of us

665
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,290
hurting each other

666
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,580
and failing together,

667
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,460
why don't we

668
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,100
harm other people instead?

669
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,580
For example,

670
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,650
I can harm Guo Xun

671
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,980
and you

672
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,170
will harm

673
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,460
the person beside him.

674
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,130
Me

675
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,890
and him?

676
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,290
No.

677
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,100
What's wrong?

678
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Are you done?

679
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,010
Don't you work out usually?

680
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,410
Gu Xun,

681
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,820
if I didn't
miss the competition with you

682
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,940
and work overtime every day,

683
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,130
would I end up like this?

684
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,890
If you choose this class again,

685
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll fire you.

686
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,770
I'll save you the trouble.

687
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,980
If we don't pass the lion dancing class,

688
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,220
we will fail the make-up exam.

689
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,250
Our Triple-A dreams

690
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,770
will be ruined thanks to lion dancing.

691
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,620
Gu Xun,

692
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,700
I have a suggestion to discuss with you.

693
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,580
What suggestion?

694
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,770
This is a good idea.

695
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,220
A combination
of a male and a female is balanced.

696
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,010
It's good for both of us.

697
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,580
Let's get high scores together.

698
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,530
Sure.

699
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,220
Then,

700
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,770
Gu Xun and Yue Qianling
will be in a group.

701
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,820
I and... What's your name?

702
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,580
I am Jiang Junnan.

703
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,170
It's not important.

704
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,820
Let's begin immediately.

705
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,500
Let's go.

706
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,460
My mother calls me Junnan.

707
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,250
My surname is Jiang.

708
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,650
Well,

709
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,650
I'll leave the lion head to you.

710
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,620
I am a girl

711
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,650
who is weak

712
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,370
so...

713
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,370
Why are you two spacing out?

714
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,500
Practice.

715
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,980
Yes. Sir.

716
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,580
Hurry up.

717
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,410
All right.

718
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,130
Then,

719
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,890
I'll hold the lion's head.

720
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,740
You can follow me.

721
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,410
Gu Xun,

722
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:07,940
how

723
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,530
do you feel?

724
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,370
Is the speed all right?

725
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,130
Should I

726
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,770
slow down?

727
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,010
Or should I speed up?

728
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,740
Gu Xun?

729
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,170
Gu Xun?

730
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,290
Stop.

731
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,130
I feel dizzy from low blood sugar.

732
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,700
Can you

733
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,050
hold me, Gu Xun?

734
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,460
It's so heavy.

735
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,410
Thank...

736
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,740
What are you doing?

737
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,500
I am practicing

738
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,050
the standing lion.

739
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,700
Good.

740
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,740
Keep it up.

741
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,700
Don't stop.

742
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,580
Yes.

743
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,530
Standing lion.

744
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,940
Mr. Gu.

745
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,580
Are you still angry at me?

746
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,940
Have a banana.

747
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,050
I'm not that petty.

748
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,290
Yue Qianling is
the prettiest girl in the university.

749
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,010
I'm not interested.

750
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,050

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,940
In HR?

938
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,410
No.

939
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,610
I'm still in Project Department 1.

940
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,740
The lady at HR was busy

941
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,540
so I am helping her out.

942
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,850
Help me as well.

943
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,500
Tell them I can't sign this.

944
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,890
Since I'm here,

945
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,090
it will be awkward
to return empty-handed.

946
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,090
It's just a few pages.

947
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,260
Mr. Gu, it won't take you long
to finish reading them.

948
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,610
I will be here

949
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,740
waiting for you.

950
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,540
It's just a few pages.

951
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,890
Just sign it...

952
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,810
And it'll be done.

953
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,460
Is Project Department 1 very free?

954
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Ask HR to speak with me.

955
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,570
Sure.
