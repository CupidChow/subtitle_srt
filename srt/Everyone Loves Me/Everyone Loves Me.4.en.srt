00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,550
Did...

193
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,960
the interview go wrong?

194
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,350
Is the manager difficult

195
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,760
to get along with?

196
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,280
The manager?

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,910
Oh, that Mr. Jiang

198
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,350
is insane.

199
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,000
The 9th Business Unit is like hell.

200
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,030
He wants us to work overtime every day

201
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,110
and loves tormenting his staff.

202
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,030
He'll fire you at the drop of a hat.

203
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,150
I advise you just to stay away.

204
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,670
Well, you can't

205
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,590
expect all managers

206
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,110
to dote on you like your parents.

207
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,960
Am I right?

208
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,670
Is this your resume?

209
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,710
I have experience now.

210
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,550
I can take a look for you.

211
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,150
Can you?

212
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,350
Let me see.

213
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you.

214
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,960
You're too kind.

215
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
Chen Xinyi, right?

216
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,110
Let's see.

217
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Good. It's good.

218
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,470
Don't be discouraged.

219
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,150
I have a few interviews bookmarked.

220
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,840
Shall I

221
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,080
send them to you?

222
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,150
Sure.

223
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,910
Okay.

[Chen Xinyi]

225
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,910
My apologies.

226
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,590
I was

227
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,790
afraid of making a mistake.

228
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,320
Done.

229
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,030
Good luck!

230
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,350
Mr. Jiang, here are two more resumes

231
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,710
for those interviewing tomorrow.

232
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,640
Please have a look.

233
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,150
Since you're a sharp one,

234
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
you'll start tomorrow.

235
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,470
Any problems?

236
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,910
No.

237
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,960
No problems.

238
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,350
See you tomorrow.

239
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

240
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,550
Bro, where are you?

241
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,520
Hurry up.

242
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,840
He's so slow.

243
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,230
When the guy has a hard time advancing

244
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,670
or has lost a lot of blood,

245
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,030
the girl can use

246
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,280
this way to send him energy

247
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
and help him.

248
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,910
Emphasize this in the third section

249
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,880
of our presentation.

250
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
It's a new way players can interact
with each other as duos.

251
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,150
Drinking alone, Mr. Jiang?

252
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, Matt.

253
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,350
Are you off work?

254
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,150
Yes.

255
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,280
The recent project meeting

256
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
has exhausted me.

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,110
Finally, I have the chance to relax

258
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,030
and learn from

259
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,910
your department.

260
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,910
What are you saying?

261
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,520
We learn from you instead.

262
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,960
Come, sit.

263
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,710
Have a drink.

264
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,840
I won't be drinking.

265
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,470
There's work to do.

266
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,550
I have to head back now.

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,110
Why was he here?

268
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,350
He was being pushed too hard
by Jiang Yishi,

269
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,640
so he came out to de-stress.

270
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,470
He was strange though.

271
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,150
I asked him to drink with me,

272
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,590
but he left soon after.

273
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,880
Before he talked to you just now,

274
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,710
what were you doing?

275
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,760
Replying to your message.

276
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,840
When I was talking
about the long-distance interaction,

277
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
he suddenly appeared.

278
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's go. Back to work.

279
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,550
No way.

280
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,840
What if he didn't hear me?

281
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,080
[HC GAME]
Today, I'll be introducing you

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,350
called "The Love Broker".

285
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,400
[Character Introduction]
We have intricate characters,

286
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,030
a rich variety of worlds,

287
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,790
a diverse range of dating options,

288
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,960
and even a new game mechanic

289
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,000
called

290
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
long-distance interaction.

291
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,840
When players are stuck on a date,

292
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,470
they can ask for help from friends.

293
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,230
Besides,

294
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
players can also interact

295
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,320
with non-playable characters.

adjust the route of the story.

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,030
Not bad.

300
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,590
Otome games these days are too similar.

301
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,440
You can think of

302
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,710
ways to stand out in small ways.

303
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,840
Excellent.

309
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,350
based on Eastern fantasy.

310
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,790

and ancient creatures

314
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,200
as our main three elements.

315
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,000
We set up a multiverse,

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,110
where nothing intersects.

317
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,150
["Hero's Path"]
The story

318
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,670
mainly happens
in the universe humans reside in.

319
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,760
A very long time ago,

320
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,790
A huge change
tore through the universe.

321
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,590
The humans' universe

322
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,150
and the creatures' universe beside it

323
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,550
clashed with each other violently.

324
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,640
They then melded together,

325
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,710
destroying human society.

While the creatures' universe

329
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,550
evaporated into energy

330

and became the core world.

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,470
Coincidentally,

334
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,880
we had also thought

335
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,030
of a long-distance interaction model.

336
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,200
However,

337
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,350
we soon realized

338
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,230
there were flaws in this model.

339
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,000
Now,

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,350
new paired interaction

Core-Surface Paired Interaction

343
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,470
is the upgraded variation
built upon the foundations

344
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,280
of our old long-distance mechanic.

345
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,710
While the couple
are not in the same world,

346
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,440
when the male lead is having difficulty,

347
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,110
the female lead will sense it.

348
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,960
The female lead can

349
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,910
interact with certain elements

350
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,640
in the surface world

351
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,320
to help the male lead
overcome the challenge.

352
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,200
I thought

353
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,320
new map with a new game design.

354
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,790
I can't interact with the set at all,

355
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,880
so why do you put a sign there?

356
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,470
The Core-Surface Paired Interaction

357
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,230
can break through the boundaries
of time and space,

358
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,030
providing new cooperative gameplay.

359
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,550
When we thought of it,

360
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,400
we stayed up all night to work on it.

361
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,790
But, tomorrow is the meeting.

362
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,670
Can Jiang Yishi really make it in time?

363
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,550
From what I know of him,

364
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,030
he will stay up all night for it.

365
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,280
He would look good before Stella

366
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,960
and pull one over me.

367
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,280
Why won't he?

368
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,960
What do we do then?

369
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,320
We're doomed.

will drastically increase.

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,640

379
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560

Thank you.

[Sticky Dough Twist]
You're welcome.

385
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,800
Do you know why I thanked you?

386
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,470
I don't,

387
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,310
but I have manners.

388
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,400
Enter.

389

[Resignation letter]
here's my resignation letter.

392
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,110
You don't even apply to transfer away

393
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,110
and just resign.

394
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,880
It looks like you're insistent
on trusting Gu Xun.

395
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,830
Triple-A development
has always been my dream.

396
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,710
I've taught you for years,

397
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,880
and now you're talking of dreams?

398
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
Mr. Jiang,

399
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,230
don't think
that with a dream and hard work,

400
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,000
you can turn a dead-end road
into a thoroughfare.

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,520
Just look

402
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,190
at how many people were going on
about being triple-A.

403
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,950
Which of them succeeded?

404
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,470
I know that.

405
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,430
Then, why are you leaving?

406
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,710
I just want to give it a go.

We'll be neighbors now.

There are so many of them.

411
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,470
I hear that this time,

412
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,710
Stella really splurged

413
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,430
and gave them

414
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,070
brand-new equipment.

415
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,590
It looks like

416
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,560
Gu Xun and the others
are quite amazing.

417
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,880
I thought

418
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,680
they would leave within the month.

419
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,310
I didn't think they would stay on.

420
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,950
They are skilled.

421
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,470
Is that Gu Xun?

422
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,310
Last time, he helped us out.

What he said at the project meeting

424
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
sounded quite impressive.

425
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,830
Maybe he can really do it.

426
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,800
He definitely can.

427
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,470

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,590
It's fine.

If it's not on the way,

569
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
I can take the metro.

570
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,590

571
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920

572
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,310

573
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,430

If you don't know what to talk about,

578
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,830
I'll get out
and help the old man cross the road.

579
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,640
He's running out of time.

580
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,760
Has he finally felt

581
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,920
the warmth of my naivete?

582
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,110
By the time you get out,

583
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,470
he's already gone.

584
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,760
He's wearing hiking shoes

585
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,350
and carrying a gym bag.

586
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,520
He's much fitter than you.

587
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,680

590
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,110
Can you please drive slower?

591
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,430
Otherwise,

592
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,920
I might puke in your car.

593

Then, he drove you home.

Money blinds you to your friends.

601
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,590
I'm telling you,

602
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,800
these two incidents

603
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,560

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,950
is not a man.

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,310
Is he trying to trick me?

613
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,710
I did as Campus Hunk said.

614
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,160
I was weak.

You don't have a date tonight, right?

639
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,760
