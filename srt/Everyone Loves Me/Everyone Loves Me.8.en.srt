You tell her.

196

It's dirty!

Maybe before you die,

218

to save your life.

is still available.

can I have my deposit refunded?

234

Why don't you go and buy batteries?

251
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,220
Or you can go to your neighbor

252

you suddenly asked them

563
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,220

564
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,940
You make good use of waste materials.

565
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,130
Although those manuscripts were denied,

566
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,340
they are all excellent.

567
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,650
We'd take the opportunity
to let them know our strengths.

568
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,100
It seems that your idea

569
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,980
worked very well.

570
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,980
Oh.

571
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,010
Should we sue Wang Hai?

574
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Hello.

575
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,410
Mr. Gu.

576
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,770
I didn't upload the painting.

577

when I left.

I'm sorry.

584
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,340
When you fired me,

585
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,100
I was unconvinced.

586
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,530
I thought it was
just my negligence after drinking.

587
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,290
Why make a mountain out of a molehill?

588
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,050
I found out today

that any negligence
can cause great losses.

590
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,940
Is there anything I can do to fix this?

591
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,890
Think carefully.

592
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,740
Recently, is there anything unusual

593
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,410
on your phone or computer?

594
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,290
I think so.

595
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,700
Later,

596
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,010
Wang Hai told me

597
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,340
what happened these days.

598
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,340
His phone was out of order,

599
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,290
so he sent it for repair.

600
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,650
The owner of the shop

601
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,650
was an avid fan of games.

602
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,340
When restoring the memory of the phone,

603
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,700
he leaked the painting.

604
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,620
He didn't know it would be so serious.

605
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,500
Who would have thought it
was a force majeure?

606
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,890
Thanks to your clever brain.

607
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,130
The leak

608
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,170
was turned

609
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,740
into a successful marketing.

610
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,860

611

Here are two versions of Lin Zhi.

616
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,050
They are both good.

617
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,500
If

618
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,370
we don't consider the leaked version,

619
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,620
I can

620
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,580
still see that version in it.

621
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,340
For players who have seen that painting,

622
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,890
it's not surprising enough.

623
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,700
Try more.

624
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,460
Okay.

625
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,580
I'll give it a try.

626

This leak

627
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,890
caught us off guard.

628

The plan is all messed up.

629
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,130
Fanxing needs

630
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,770
to draw the Hero, Ming Chen.

631
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,860

How about this?

634
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,010
You focus on the creation of the hero.

635
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,740
I'll find another key animator

636
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,890
to draw Lin Zhi.

637
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,890
Okay.

638
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,580
As long as the person is excellent,

639
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,940
I have no problem with it.

Although her face looks young,

655

we can feel the chivalrous spirit in it.

The colors are also nice.

The gradient of the two colors

659

Chinese style.

Master, you also feel that way.

680
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,700
I think

00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,340
that the heroes

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,460
to Epang Palace only, right?

752
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,410
I love to study

753
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,940
different styles
of ancient architecture.

754
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,610
So I thought

755
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,060
I'd try to see if I could mix them all

756
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,130
and see if I could make a superb piece.

757
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,260
All the details are so meticulous.

758
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,020
You can see that?

759
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
But I'm afraid the core requirement

760
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,370
of the 1st Business Unit isn't this.

761
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,850
True, so I have to change it.

762
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,610
But I had fun talking to you.

763
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,980
Thank you.

764
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,220
I'll go back now.

765
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,860
[Hi. I like your work.
Can we talk in detail?]

766
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,090
Sleep Till Wake.

767
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,220
I seem to have seen this name somewhere.

768
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:44,980
Boss.

769
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,540
Why is this game so difficult?

770
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,130
And the person who ranks first

771
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,300
scores so high!

772
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,570
She must have spent a lot of money!

773
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,410
The girl who ranks first

774
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,890
is very capable.

775
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,130
- Girl?
- You.

776
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,980
Try to get out of the last places

777
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,300
and then challenge.

778
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,090
Did this girl come again?

779
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,810
Here comes the second on the list.

780
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,940
She hasn't been here for a long time.

781
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,540
Do you know her real name?

782
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,890
Do you have her contact?

783
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,570
We never ask for real names.

784
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,700
Take you for an example.

785
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,220
We call you by your game name

786
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,980
or we call you the second on the list.

787
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,610
Those who don't have cards
are passers-by.

788
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,060
You have a crush on her?

789
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,810
You even come to me.

790
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,090
Do you remember

791
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
when was the last time she came?

792
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,850
Last time?

793
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,300
Last time you were here.

794
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,980
It was the day of the competition.

795
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,540
Boss, please come here.

796
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,220
Coming.

797
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,260
Come out!

798
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,460
Is it her?

799
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,890
In terms of game skills,

800
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,850
it seems possible.

801
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,300
Xinyi.

802
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,570
Are you busy?

803
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,130
Help me deliver it if you are not busy.

804
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,740
Okay.

805
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,780
Thank you.

806
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,220
[Chen Xinyi's resignation letter]

807
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,700
[VIP list. Give me before 2 p.m.]

808
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,980
Some VIP game bloggers

809
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,890
invite me for an interview tomorrow.

810
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,650
Prepare well.

811
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,570
I'm giving you the interview draft
ahead of time.

812
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,850
They will talk about the leak for sure.

813
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,410
Bring the topic to the game creation.

814
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,410
Tomorrow's list is on your desk.

815
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,890
Feel free to ask me
if you have any questions.

816
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,090
Mr. Jiang.

817
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,060
- Go ahead.
- I...

818
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,020
[VIP list. Give me before 2 p.m.]

819
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,810
She drew a new work!

820
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,570
It's better than the last time!

821
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,540
- Please reply to me!
- Me too!

822
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,370
- Me too!
- Me too!

823
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,170
Great God.

824
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,220
Were you the No.1 player
in the game hall last time?

825
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,410
Awesome!

826
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,940
Really?

827
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,540
She also plays video games?

828
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,370
Which game hall?

829
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,540
I'm going there!

830
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,890
Count me in.

831
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,410
Domination Arcade.

832
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,540
Let's go!

833
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,610
It is her.

834
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,980
Sleep Till Wake.

835
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,090
Are you Sleep Till Wake?

836
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,460
What?

837
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,460
I am Wake Naturally.

838
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,890
Do you feel too good about yourself

839
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,980
and think everyone
wants to take advantage of you?

840
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,370
I'm talking about the ID
in Domination Arcade.

841
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,610
Was it you?

842
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,090
Let's go together some other time.

843
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,220
I won't go with you!

844
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,740
I mean playing games.

845
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,740
Boss.

846
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,850
Boss.

847
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,460
Boss.

848
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,650
Boss.

849
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,570
It's you?

850
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,610
I want to change my name!

851
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,410
Change your name?

852
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,460
Your present name

853
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,650
defeats everyone in the world.

854
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,650
If you change your name,

855
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,700
others would think

856
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,650
someone else became the top.

857
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,410
I

858
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,130
want

859
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,410
to change my name!

860
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,610
Alright!

861
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,460
What name do you want to use?

862
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,060
Pepper Coriander.

863
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,300
Why don't you use your ID number?

864
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,940
Young man, it's her...

865
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,540
Gu Xun.

866
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,890
Believe it or not,

867
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,610
the name Sleep Till Wake

868
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,370
is a little wish of mine.

869
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,810
You guys go on.

870
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,300
About what happened
at the commencement ceremony.

871
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,090
At that time,

872
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,370
I was an innocent student.

873
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,410
And my aesthetics and pursuit were ugly.

874
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,300
But I'm all right now.

875
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,540
We're not in the same department.

876
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,610
Therefore, we have nothing

877
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,940
to talk about.

878
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,090
See you never.

879
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,500
