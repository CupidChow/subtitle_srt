125
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,540

129
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,450
Mr. Gu!

130
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,290
Is there really a picture?

131
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm sure she's beautiful.

132
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,620
Forget it.

133
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,170
My girlfriend is shy.

134
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,620
How boring.

135
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,100
- No wonder.
- What a party pooper.

136
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,340
I once tried to hook Mr. Gu up
with someone

137
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,940
but he said she was not his type

138
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,730
without even looking at her picture.

139
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,170
It turns out he has already met
his type.

140
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,450
You already have a type?

141
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,250
She's not really my type.

142
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,850
I can only say

143
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,730

160
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,170

- There are so many strawberries.

Time to go home. Let's go.

167
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,620
Hello, check, please.

168
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,820
I've paid for it.

169
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,730
I'm treating everyone

170
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,820

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,290
Thank you, Mr. Gu!

172
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,220
Thank you, Mr. Gu!

173
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,170
- Let's go. We are going the same way.
- All right.

174
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,450
Why do I not know

175
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,130
that you have your girlfriend's picture?

176
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,940
Do you want to see it?

177
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,170
I've read

178
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,250
"Into the Light Blue" as well.

179
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,060
I like the collection it shows.

180
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,940
It brings out the suffocation

181
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,730
and mystery of the deep sea.

182
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,410
Right?

183
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,450
I think so too.

184
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,220
Look.

185
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,610
Take this octopus for example.

186
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,250
If we change

187
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,620
its form

188
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
and add some scales,

189
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,570
a deep sea monster will be born.

190
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,790

381
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,970
I can't take it back now.

382
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,010
We'll hang out normally

383
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,060
and work together normally.

384
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,330
As long as I don't feel awkward,

385
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,490
he'll be the one embarrassing himself.

386
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,420
Young lady.

387
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,180
Why are you all alone today?

388
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,300
Where is your boyfriend?

389
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,130
- He...
- It's all right.

390
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,330
This is for you.

391
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,660
Remember to smile.

392
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,660
Take it.

393
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,300
Thank you.

394
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,210
Don't mention it.

395
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,250
- Go on.
- Thank you.

396
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,010
Recently, Su Zheng and I

397
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,060
have been inspired by a magazine
called "Ocean Photography".

398
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
We want to create an underwater map

399
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,010
so the style of Hero's Path

400
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,300
can be more diverse.

401
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,420
What do you think?

402
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,010
No wonder you've been spending time
with Su Zheng recently.

403
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,730
What did you say?

404
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,970
Nothing.

405
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm saying that you are doing

406
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,580
what the concept art should be doing.

407
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,370
I did find drawing fun

408
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,900
while I was making
the weapons back then.

409
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,820
Do you want to take up the challenge?

410
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,370
Can I

411
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,330
do it?

412
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,420
Are you willing to become

413
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,900
Hero's Path's concept artist?

414
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Yes.

415
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,900
It's burnt.

416
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,370
Why are you here?

417
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,490
I'm crashing with you today.

418
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,580
Why else am I here?

419
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,580
It's inconvenient.

420
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,250
Why?

421
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,540
Your girlfriend isn't home.

422
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,970
Yue Qianling?

423
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,130
Why are you here?

424
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,420
Hello.

425
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,250
Don't you know
that Gu Xun has a girlfriend?

426
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,300
It's not a good idea for you
to be here at night, is it?

427
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,610
I'm not saying
that you are a homewrecker,

428
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,970
but it makes him look like a playboy.

429
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,060
I'll go back first.

430
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,820
Safe travels.

431
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,460
We are together.

432
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,330
That's right.
You could've said it sooner.

433
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,130
Do you think you can fool me
like you fooled others?

434
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,610
Leave.

435
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,580
Don't kick me out.
It's something important.

436
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,250
Come here.

437
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,210
I'll tell you everything.

438
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,580
You see,

439
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,330
I have a friend.

440
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,820
His subordinate confessed
to him recently.

441
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,610
Then, you...

442
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,180
How did

443
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,010
your friend respond to it?

444
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,580
He said

445
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,700
he wasn't sure if he liked her or not

446
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,780
so...

447
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,090
He fled.

448
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,010
Did he flee?

449
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,300
What the heck?

450
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,700
Well, he wasn't sure

451
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,130
if he liked her or not.

452
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,940
So he...

453
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,420
Your friend is so unreliable.

454
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,490
Not only did he make a girl confess
to him,

455
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,060
he even chickened out in that situation.

456
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,700
And he calls himself a man?

457
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,730
So you want...

458
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,250
So your friend wants to ask

459
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,970
how to know
whether he has feelings for her or not.

460
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,490
Tell him.

461
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,700
It's fine if he doesn't know
the answer right now.

462
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,180
He can take his time

463
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,370
but

464
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,210
don't hurt that girl.

465
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,370
Do you hear me?

466
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,210
Do you understand?

467
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,940
Yes.

468
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,850
Can I have some noodles?

469
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,490
- Go!
- Go.

470
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,130
Calm down. It's not worth it.

471
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,300
Let's go.

472
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,940
What? Aren't you afraid
that people might find out?

473
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,210
Such a coincidence won't happen.

474
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,610
Huang Jie is here.

475
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,730
Qianling.

476
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,370
Huang Jie.

477
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,250
You're coming to work?

478
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,940
Mr. Gu.

479
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,900
Don't you need
to send your girlfriend to work?

480
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,490
I just did.

481
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,060
You sent your girlfriend to work

482
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,540
and then you gave your colleague a lift.

483
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,540
Mr. Gu,

484
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
you sure can multitask.

485
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,420
Actually, we...

486
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,610
Mr. Gu,

487
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,420
just because
Qianling is pretty and naive

488
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,060
doesn't mean
you can take her for a fool.

489
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,370
Because of you,

490
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,250
Qianling has been

491
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,300
the target of many unfounded rumors
in the company.

492
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,730
Can you stop being so greedy

493
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,730
and hurt Qianling here?

494
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:25,820
Let's go.

495
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,300
Qianling.

496
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,130
If we don't
make our relationship public,

497
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,210
the whole company will think

498
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,700
that I'm a playboy.

499
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,210
Both of you...

500
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,250
You and him...

501
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,610
Yes.

502
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,820
We are dating.

503
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,820
I knew it!

504
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,090
You finally admit it.

505
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,060
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

506
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,010
I was joking just now.

507
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,850
I know you weren't a playboy.

508
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,660
Huang Jie.

509
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,540
Do you already know about this?

510
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,900
It's very obvious.

511
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,820
How can I not notice?

512
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,370
I already found out that you two

513
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,060
were dating

514
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,780
at the cafe.

515
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,540
Why did you tease us just now?

516
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,730
I just wanted to see how long

517
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,970
you can put up the act.

518
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,900
Stupid Qianling,

519
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,610
aren't we besties?

520
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,420
This is huge. Why didn't you tell me?

521
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,940
Apart from Jiang Junnan,

522
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,900
you are the first person

523
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
from the company who knows about it.

524
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,180
Really?

525
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,970
Only the two of us know about it?

526
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
That's more like it.

527
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,010
So...

528
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,660
Let's go.

529
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,970
Let's go.

530
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
Did you tell Jiang Junnan?

531
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,060
How did you know?

532
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,850
It's not important.

533
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,730
Tell me everything first.

534
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,180
It's all my fault.

535
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,090
I drank too much
and acted on my impulse...

536
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,180
I swear

537
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,660
not to drink anymore.

538
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,730
You need to remind me.

539
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,700
But I felt relieved

540
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,490
after I said it.

541
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,370
The ball is in his court now.
He can do whatever he wants.

542
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,780
I'll just do my job as usual.

543
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,730
What if he is no longer confused

544
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,370
and wants to be with you,

545
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,490
will you agree to date him?

546
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,660
I'm not sure. We'll see.

547
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,730
Now that he knows about my feelings,

548
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,060
it feels like

549
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,850
it's the perfect ending.

550
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,490
It's fine.

551
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,540
Now that you've confessed,

552
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,730
you feel better.

553
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,090
The choice

554
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,210
is in your hands.

555
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,330
Me?

556
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,210
It's all right.

557
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,250
Qianling.

558
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,330
Xinyi.

559
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,850
Let me borrow Qianling for a while.

560
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,540
Come here.

561
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,210
I should go.

562
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,210
Go.

563
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,330
Come here.

564
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,010
Why are you acting all mysterious?

565
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,130
For you.

566
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,330
What are these?

567
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,460
I don't want them.

568
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,250
How can you not want them?

569
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,010
I bought you the latest design.

570
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,210
It'll look good on you.

571
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,130
I don't think so.

572
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,460
Don't be shy.

573
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,060
Think about it.

574
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,060
You have a boyfriend now.

575
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,730
Mr. Gu

576
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,330
looks cool on the outside

577
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,460
but perhaps deep inside...

578
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,580
No.

579
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,210
Not at all.

580
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,660
Trust me.

581
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,330
You might

582
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,940
thank me tomorrow.

583
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,820
Qianling.

584
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,210
My laptop charger is broken.

585
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,580
I'm going to buy one.

586
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,460
Wait for me. I'm getting changed.

587
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,250
All right.

588
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,820
Gu...

589
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,420
It looks nice.

590
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,370
Do you like it?

591
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,780
I like it a lot.

592
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Then...

593
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,940
I can lend it to you if you want.

594
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,490
There's no need. I...

595
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,330
I'm heading out.

596
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,250
Isn't this

597
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,420
too sexy?

598
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:28,850
Hello?

599
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,730
Qianling.

600
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,970
Can you send me

601
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,660
the compressed files
for Lin Zhi's drawing?

602
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,090
It's urgent. Can you make it quick?

603
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,370
All right. Let me find it.

604
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,060
Compressed files.

605
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,250
Qianling.

606
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,060
What's wrong?

607
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,490
Fan Xing asked me to send her

608
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,460
Lin Zhi's compressed files.

609
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,850
But I forgot to bring my laptop back.

610
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,180
She said it was urgent.

611
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,850
Just use my computer.

612
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,250
All right.

613
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,210
So? Did you receive it?

614
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,060
It's still sending. Please wait.

615
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Fan Xing.

616
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,940
I've sent you the compressed files.

617
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Remember to check your mailbox.

618
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,250
Let me know if you need something else.

619
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,660
No bother at all.

620
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,250
Don't mention it.

621
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,660
Done.

622
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,970
Gu Xun, are you back?

623
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,820
Madam?

624
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
You are...

625
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,540
I am Gu Xun's mother.

626
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,730
Hello, Mrs. Gu.

627
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,060
I am Gu Xun's neighbor.

628
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,540
My laptop broke down

629
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,660
so I came here to borrow his computer.

630
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,610
His computer was on the bed

631
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,180
so I came in.

632
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,580
You must be Qianling.

633
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,250
I was classmates with your mother.

634
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,420
That's right.

635
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,010
My mother mentioned you.

636
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,490
Hello, Mrs. Gu.

637
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,850
- Your sleeping gown...
- I...

638
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,540
I don't wear this normally.

639
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,420
There's no need to be nervous.

640
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,250
I'm pretty open-minded.

641
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,060
I like the design of your sleeping gown.

642
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,660
It looks good on you.

643
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,580
Mrs. Gu.

644
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,010
If you like it,

645
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,300
can I buy one for you?

646
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,250
Sure.

647
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,490
I wear a large.

648
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,780
Let me transfer the money to you.

649
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,460
There's no need.

650
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,970
Let's add each other on WeChat.

651
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,580
You just need to send me your address.

652
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,010
- No need to transfer money to me.
- Scan my QR code.

[Gu Xun]

656
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,420
I bought everything.

657
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,730
Are you waiting for me at home?

658
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
Well...

659
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,250
Your mother is here.

660
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,660
Mom.

661
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,130
I thought you were home.

662
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,420
Where did you go?

663
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,700
Come back immediately.

664
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,090
I'll come back immediately.

665
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,730
Hurry.

666
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,940
Well... Mrs. Gu,

667
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,700
Gu Xun will be back soon.

668
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,060
Why don't I

669
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,700
make you some tea?

670
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,610
Sure.

671
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,060
Let's go outside.

672
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,850
Qianling.

673
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,300
Are you and Gu Xun...

674
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,970
That's good.

675
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,850
Are you both

676
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,700
living together now?

677
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,250
No.

678
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,060
Actually,

679
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,780
I live opposite him.

680
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,330
I get it.

681
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,820
Qianling.

682
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,900
Do you mind

683
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
settling down with Gu Xun?

684
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,940
Mom.

685
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,820
You're back?

686
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,970
What brought you here?

687
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,540
I'm here to visit you.

688
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,370
Am I not welcome here?

689
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,660
Why don't I

690
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,660
go home first?

691
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,490
You can have a chat
with Gu Xun, Mrs. Gu.

692
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,900
Qianling, don't go.

693
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,940
Stay and eat with me.

694
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,420
I've brought some delicious food.

695
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,090
Sure.

696
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,210
Let me go back and get changed.

697
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:08,820
Sure.

698
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,700
Great.

699
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,090
Not bad.

700
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,540
You little brat.

701
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,420
You finally got it straight.

702
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,850
Your girlfriend is so pretty.

703
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,940
Well...

704
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,610
What does Qianling like to eat?

705
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,250
Qianling?

706
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,970
She...

707
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,060
She's fine with anything.

708
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,900
She doesn't have a preference.

709
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,420
She doesn't have a preference?

710
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,090
Listen.

711
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,660
I am really fond

712
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,210
of Qianling.

713
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,940
She is also my classmate's daughter.

714
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,850
You must treat her well.

715
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,700
Also,

716
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,090
if you break her heart,

717
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,300
I won't forgive you.

718
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,730
Don't worry, Mom.

719
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,300
Let me go and check on Qianling.

720
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
Go.

721
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,050
Qianling.

722
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,770
I'm not wearing clothes!

723
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,180
What did my mother tell you?

724
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,530
She asked if we were living together

725
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,500
and asked me

726
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,700
when we would be settling down.

727
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,570
It was sudden for me

728
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,290
and my mind went blank.

729
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,570
I didn't know how to reply to her.

730
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,260
Did she ask you where you worked?

731
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,090
No.

732
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,260
When my mother asks about work,

733
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,220
tell her we are working
in the AI department

734
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,660
at Polar Star Technology.

735
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,330
All right.

736
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,850
Mom.

737
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,020
We are back.

738
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,180
Mom?

739
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,940
Mom.

740
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,770
This is what you're working on?

741
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,700
Mom, listen to me.

742
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,330
Is this what you're working on?

743
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,530
Yes.

744
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,530
Mom.

745
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,570
Mom, listen to me. Mom.

746
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,370
Mom!

747
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,900
I know I lied.

748
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,370
I promised not to get involved in games.

749
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,130
But Dad is actually...

750
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,610
Don't mention him!

751
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,810
I'll give you two options.

752
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,370
One,

753
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,050
resign.

754
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,770
Two,

755
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,370
you're no longer my son.

756
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,700
There, there.

757
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,130
Your mother

758
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,900
got carried away by her emotions.

759
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,290
Give her a couple of days

760

Sorry.

Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

764
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,020
Are you going to keep a tortoise
in the office?

765
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,370
It fell sick recently.

766
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,130
I can't leave it all alone
in my house during the day

767
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,610
so I want to take care of it
in the office.

768
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,900
Is it okay if I do that?

769
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,370
Sure.

770
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,180
Let me help you.

771
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,130
No need.

772
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,980
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

773
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,610
This won't affect my work.

774
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,610
Where did this tortoise come from?
It's so cute.

775
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,530
I've had it
ever since I moved out of your place.

776
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,850
And you know my character from before.

777
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,260
I didn't have any friends,

778
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,500
so I could only talk to it at home.

779
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,940
However, Coconut fell sick recently.

780
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,420
I'm quite worried.

781
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,370
What kind of sickness?

782
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,500
Skin infection.

783
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,570
It's common among tortoises.

784
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,420
What can you do?

785
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,220
Why don't I go with you

786
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,980

787
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,660

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,130
You must consider

829
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,610

The company

837
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,260
has pumped in huge investments
for Hero's Path in the last year.

838
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,370
Until now,

839
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,130
we haven't made a single cent.

840
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,850
Since there's a hype

841
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,290
surrounding the game,

842
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,500
let's do a pre-sale.

843
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,570
We

844
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,020
have no plan to do that as of now.

845
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,700
Well,

846
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,850
the situation has changed.

847
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,020
Hero's Path has burned a lot of money.

848
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,570
It's time for it
to bring something back for the company.

849
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,420
I disagree.

850
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,980
Why not?

851
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,370
Other international developers

852
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,420
can do that

853
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,740
but we can't?

854
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,050
Unless

855
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,260
it can't make any profit at all.

856
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,770
You want to reap the profit

857

858
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,570
That is impossible

859
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,810
for any game developer.

860
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,940
But don't you worry.

861
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,570
Our current progress

862
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,850
is ahead of the schedule
stipulated in the three-year contract.

863
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,290
I'm sure

864
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,940
the profit and fame
we will bring to the company

865
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,370
will also exceed your expectations.

866
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,980
Enough. Don't give me a pie in the sky.

867
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,660
Just tell me,

868
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,460
can we do a pre-sale

869
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,900

870
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,770
No.

At this stage,

873
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,290
I agree with Gu Xun's decision.

874
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,940
You can't view the problem

875
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,090
from your perspective alone.

876
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,050

and the shareholders' interests.
