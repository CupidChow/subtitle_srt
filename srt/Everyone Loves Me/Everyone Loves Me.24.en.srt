135
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,660
when did you become so familiar
with Mr. Zhao?

136
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,100
We used to be brothers

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,900
from the same alley.

138
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,540
I was the one

139
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,170
who helped him get his first bucket
of gold.

140
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,970
But Dad,

141
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,010
did you think

142
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,220
about what would happen
if you can't persuade him?

143
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,940
If he sells

144
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,970
the 10% shares he's holding,

145
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,760

148
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,290
HC Interactive is valued at 1.2 billion.

149
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,710

150
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,790
around a hundred million.

151
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,140

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,780
Are you selling the house?

154
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,660
One more thing I didn't tell you about.

155
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,340
Back then,
it was 5 units that were demolished.

156

Later on,

158
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,170

in stocks

160
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,970

168
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,690
to have a backup plan.

169
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,340

173
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,180
I've done you such a great favor.

174
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,810
Shouldn't you be thanking me,

175
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,340
with something like a promotion?

176
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,010
Like a promotion to security captain?

177
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,250
No problem.

178
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,690
No problem at all.

I'm fine in Project Department 1 now.

182
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,690
The work is challenging

183
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,930
and the leaders trust me.

184
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,250
I was wrong.

185
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,930
What did you do wrong?

186
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,250
Why are you apologizing to me?

187
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,690
I'll tell you everything first

188
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,810
from now on.

189
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,050

So you did know that?

377
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,490
Do you know what time it is?

378
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,900
Get up and eat now.

379
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,580
It's the New Year.

380
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,970
Why don't you help me clean up?

381
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,730
You neglect so many chores.

382
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,130
Can't you care about me?

383
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm getting old already.

384
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,540
What are you doing?

385
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,210
Playing with your phone every day.

386
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,850
You have a better relationship
with your phone than we do.

387
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,010
Mom,

388
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,610
people get sick of it
when they come back for a month

389
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,940
and it took me two days.

390
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,610
Because you're worse
than everybody else.

391
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,820
- Mom!
- Get up now.

392
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,460
Listen to me.

393
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,970
Mom, is there a delivery for me?

394
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,780
No.

395
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,660
Get up and eat already.

396
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,370
Quickly.

397
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,460
Alright.

398
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,730
Hello?

399
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,420
Good morning.

400
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,660
What happened?

401
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,610
Why greet me like that?

402
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,700
I can't call you if there's nothing?

403
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,010
I thought you said

404
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,730
my present was coming soon?

405
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,490
Why hasn't it arrived yet?

406
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,780
Almost there.

407
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,610
About that...

408
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,660
I...

409
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,210
I miss you already.

410
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,940
Me too.

411
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Really?

412
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,940
Then come on out.

413
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,780
Sign up for your New Year's gift.

414
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,820
I...

415
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,610
Watch your back.

416
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,330
Go slowly.

417
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:43,940
Girly!

418
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,090
Hold it right there.

419
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,090
Where are you going?

420
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,250
You're in a hurry even in your pajamas.

421
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,180
Dad,

422
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,210
my...

423
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
my boyfriend is here.

424
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,420
What?

425
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,370
Boyfriend?

426
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,820
- What...
- Your boyfriend is here?

427
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,090
Boyfriend?

428
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,420
Gu is here?

429
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,820
What are you waiting for?

430
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,660
Bring him in.

431
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,330
Wait a minute!

432
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,460
It's not that easy

433
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,060
to get in our house.

434
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,010
What do you mean by that?

435
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,540
Girly,

436
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,580
do you really like him?

437
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,010
Yes, I do.

438
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,970
I've seen that young man.

439
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,730
He's really nice.

440
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,940
He brought her breakfast,

441
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,820
did the housework,

442
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,180
did the laundry, mopped the floor,

443
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,420
and even gave massages.

444
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,610
The key is, he's kind to our daughter.

445
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,180
But not as good as you of course.

446
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
That's obvious.

447
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,970
Call him in!

448
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,210
Wait a minute.

449
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,090
How about this?

450
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,780
Let him prove

451
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,010
how well he treats you.

452
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,700
Right?

453
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,780
How?

454
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,130
Dad's got a trick for you.

455
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,610
Why are you here?

456
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,090
I had a New Year's Eve dinner
with my mom yesterday.

457
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,130
And I came here at night.

458
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,460
Well, why didn't you tell me?

459
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,900
I wanted to give you a surprise.

460
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,460
Come in!

461
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,370
Would it be inconvenient?

462
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,820
It's fine.

463
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,010
Mom would be so happy.

464
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,330
Oh yeah?

465
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,130
As for Dad,
I don't know if he'll be happy.

466
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,970
Is Mr. Yue mean?

467
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,700
We'll see in a minute.

468
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,180
Dad!

469
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,940
Mom!

470
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,210
Gu!

471
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,820
Happy New Year, Mrs. Yue.

472
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,940
Hello!

473
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,970
Got something for you.

474
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,730
Oh, you!

475
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,730
Why did you buy it for a visit here?

476
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,970
So, you're Qianling's boyfriend?

477
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,660
Happy New Year, Mr. Yue.

478
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,940
You just showed up without any notice.

479
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,090
Just in time for New Year's Day today.

480
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,660
I thought I'd pay my visit and respects
to you both.

481
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,940
- Yeah.
- And meet with Qianling.

482
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,850
You haven't eaten, have you?

483
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,540
Come, Gu.

484
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,700
Let's eat.

485
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,730
It was a long journey. Let's eat.

486
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,490
Is this what you're wearing?

487
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,460
Go get changed!

488
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,780
Didn't even wash your hair?

489
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,610
Here.

490
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,940
Be careful! Here.

491
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,090
Mom. Here.

492
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,730
- It's hot!
- Careful!

493
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,730
It's hot!

494
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,940
The food is ready.

495
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,660
Gu,

496
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,490
we're especially happy
that you're here today.

497
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,700
That's why I've made you a table
full of food.

498
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,060
Didn't know what you like to eat.

499
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
So, just eat.

500
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,580
Make yourself at home here.

501
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,090
Eat whatever you want.

502
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,250
Okay?

503
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,370
Yeah, when I come home,

504
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,250
mom doesn't even cook that much.

505
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,090
Eat up!

506
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,940
Let's eat.

507
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,970
Here, Gu.

508
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,370
Let's try a piece of pork trotter.

509
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,090
Mrs. Yue got up in the middle
of the night to cook it.

510
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,660
It's really soft. See.

511
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,250
- It's like no bone at all, right?
- It's melted.

512
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:17,850
Here.

513
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,370
Here.

514
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,180
Careful.

515
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,490
Grab with the bowl.

516
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,780
Alright.

517
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,060
- Here's a prawn.
- Thanks, Mr. Yue.

518
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
- Give him a prawn.
- A very fresh prawn!

519
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,130
Have a taste.

520
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,700
Have a taste of the prawn.

521
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,060
Pork trotter and prawn?

522
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,730
Prawn?

523
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,180
Have a taste.

524
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,060
You don't have to spit out the shell.

525
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,210
Just swallow it.

526
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,850
It's real wine this time, isn't it?

527
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,780
As Zhuge Liang said,

528
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,130
real nature can be observed
when drunk on wine.

529
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,610
Mr. Yue, you're so artsy.

530
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,490
Now, I'll ask and you'll answer.

531
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,970
Whenever I'm not satisfied,

532
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,900
you'll have to drink.

533
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,180
Qianling, pour the wine.

534
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,130
Wait, Dad.

535
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,060
If he drinks alone,

536
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,610
then when do you drink?

537
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,700
I can drink whenever I want.

538
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,850
Quickly.

539
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,060
Introduce yourself first.

540
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,660
Alright.

541
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,660
My name is Gu Xun.

542
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm 23 years old.

543
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,780
My height is 187cm.

544
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,970
Weight 65kg.

545
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,580
I'm

546
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,420
Qianling's boyfriend.

547
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,580
Drink.

548
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,330
Are you

549
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,250
unsatisfied

550
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,850
with my height and weight?

551
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,900
Everything!

552
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,820
Especially the word boyfriend.

553
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,780
Actually, I'm also Qianling's leader.

554
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,210
I hate office romances.

555
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,850
Like in the TV show.

556
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,970
Male leaders rely on their status.

557
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,130
At work time,

558
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,540
they send messages

559
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,250
to female subordinates

560
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,010
to play games

561
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,300
and chat.

562
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,250
Even called himself her best friend

563
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,370
and deliberately moved in
across the door.

564
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,420
Always greeting

565
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,730
and said he was the best neighbor.

566
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,820
Also...

567
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
Mr. Yue,

568
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,900
let's stop here.

569
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,090
I'll drink.

570
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,940
How far along are you

571
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,250
with my daughter?

572
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,180
Dad!

573
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,660
Relax, Mr. Yue.

574
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,870
Although we were together
for just a short while,

575
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,300
if you think

576
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,060
we're going a little slow,

577
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,550
I can propose to her earlier.

578
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,460
- What are you saying?
- Rest assured,

579
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,850
I'll be good to Qianling.

580
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,130
Is my daughter yours to propose to?

581
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,060
What's on your mind, kid?

582
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,820
You're out of your mind!

583
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,330
Drink!

584
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,060
I'll drink.

585
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,490
Dad,

586
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,850
that's about it.

587
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,780
Too much will make him sick.

588
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,580
Fine.

589
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,300
Last question.

590
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,540
Then how do you prove

591
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,300
that you will treat her well?

592
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,780
Mr. Yue,

593
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,460
here's my paycheck card.

594
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,330
And?

595
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,330
This is my car keys.

596
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,610
Just these?

597
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,820
This is my insurance.

598
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,700
The beneficiary is Qianling.

599
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,490
And then?

600
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
Also...

601
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,660
Also...

602
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,680
Also, I'm...

603
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,810
I'm left with this.

604
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,580
Sleep on these.

605
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,010
How can you sleep

606
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,060
on such a small couch?

607
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,250
Can't even stretch your legs.

608
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,330
It's all right.

609
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,900
I got you a new pillow
and a new comforter.

610
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,820
Thanks.

611
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,490
I'll go back to my room then.

612
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,670
What's up?

613
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,930
Have you forgotten something?

614
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,810
What is it?

615
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,540
Good night.

616
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,820
Go.

617
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,250
Good luck for tomorrow.

618
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,820
Good morning, Mr. Yue.

619
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,580
What time is it already?

620
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,820
It's only five o'clock.

621
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,780
Do you think it's early?

622
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,900
Five o'clock...

623
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,900
Follow me

624
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,420

625
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,850
Mr. Yue, you're really healthy.

626
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,300
That's it. It's got a nice shape.

627
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,850
Sunny side up.

628
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,900
Why sunny side up?

629
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,730
Because my daughter loves it.

630
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,910
Medium well.

631
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,830
Be careful with that heat.

632
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,730
Then I'll turn down the heat.

633
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,540
It's in nice shape.

634
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,210
Is it okay?

635
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,180
Yes.

636
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,210
Fried eggs are here.

637
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,610
Sunny side up, medium well.

638
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,660
It's your favorite.

639
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,250
Thanks.

640
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,010
Let's eat.

641
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,580
Um...

642
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,210
I think the bulb is broken.

643
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,700
Why doesn't it light up?

644
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,730
Do we have to change it?

645
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,540
Let me do it.

646
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,820
Being taller is useful.

647
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,850
Why is this chair rocking
back and forth?

648
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,610
I'll take care of it, Mrs. Yue.

649

650
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,820
Thanks.

651
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,580
It should be...

652
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,730
The eggs are delicious.

653
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,330
Delicious.

654
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,010
There's something wrong
with the toilet.

655
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,370
I think it's stuck.

656
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,780
Let me do it.

657
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,580
- Can you?
- Can you do it too?

658
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,540
I can, Mr. Yue.

659
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,610
He's fine with that too!

660
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,180
Mom,

661
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,330
do I need to change the sheet?

662
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Oh, I forgot.

663
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,010
Mrs. Yue, take a seat.

664
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,970

- It works.
- Really?

666
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,730
Great idea.

667
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,940
You've worked hard.

668
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,180
It's fine.

669

Gu,

675
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,300
Qianling is lactose intolerant,

676
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,700
so she can't drink milk.

677
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,330
Grinding her teeth at night
is a sign of calcium deficiency.

678
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,610
Also,

679
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,820
she doesn't like to eat breakfast.

It's not gonna work.

681
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,250

is bad for the stomach.

682
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,490
You'll have to keep an eye out for me.

683

00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,010
Okay.

689
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,420
Qianling loved fried chestnuts
since she was a little girl.

690
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,060
She had it every day before.

691
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,540
That's why her teeth have gone bad.

692
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,940
You should buy her less

693
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,130
in the future.

How did you take care of him?

718
