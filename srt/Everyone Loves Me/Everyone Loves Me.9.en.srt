Do you want me to go
to the 9th Business Unit?

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,980
Yes.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,210
You're not pulling my leg, are you?

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,980
Do I look like that kind of person?

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,130
You do.

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,170
Are you not transferring
to the 9th Business Unit?

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,060
Nope.

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,210
Don't rush to reject me.

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,940
Let me think about it.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,570
Nope.

37
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,490
I think Triple-A suits you more.

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,660
You think?

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,490
I am very familiar with the Otome genre.

40
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,660
Who told you I'd be better suited
to Triple-A games?

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,740
You.

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,970
You saw it.

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,100
They were just doodles I drew
when I was bored.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,690
Judging by how complete
the drawings were,

45
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,900
they must not have been drawn
out of boredom.

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,820
Also, your recent works fit in well

47
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,410
with the art style of "Hero's Path".

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,610
You're that confident
that I want to get into Triple-A games?

49
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,460
It's only one of my reasons.

50
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,050
Characters for "Hero's Path"
have been leaked.

51
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,490
You knew that as well.

52
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,820
I need to push past all current designs,

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,770
but my designers

54
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,460
are too familiar with the characters.

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,820
It would be hard for them to transcend

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,210
the limitations of our designs
within a short time.

57
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,380
I urgently need new ideas.

58
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,850
There was no need to tell me

59
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,820
about something this confidential.

60
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,900
Also, in the company,

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,210
there are plenty of people
who want to transfer over.

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,610
The drawing you drew
at the interview was not bad.

63
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,460
Based on your capabilities,

64
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,540
I have faith in you.

65
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,740
If you have any requests,

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,770
just let me know.

67
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,460
Work is one thing,

68
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,540
and personal affairs are another.

69
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,770
You need not worry.

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,050
Mr. Gu,

71
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,100
you worry too much.

72
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,490
I keep a clear boundary
between work and personal affairs too.

73
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,970
In private,

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,570
we have both moved on.

75
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,820
As for work,

76
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,610
I refuse.

77
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,300
No rush.

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,540
You can keep thinking about it.

79
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,540
You've already been direct with him?

80
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,460
I'm more direct than he was
when he rejected me then.

81
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,050
Were there no considerations at all?

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,260
Actually, I quite like

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,180
the key animations
from the 9th Business Unit.

84
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,820
I only drew that heroine

85
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,460
because of their influence.

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,770
Still,

87
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,140
it's the 9th Business Unit.

88
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,420
I don't have the experience.

89
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,010

90
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,100
are all true masters.

91
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,890
When did you become humble?

92
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,770
Well,

93
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,290
my greatest weakness
is being too humble.

94
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,940
Also, I don't want to see Gu Xun.

95
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,010
You're still trapped by your crush.

96
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,170
I have to go.

97
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,860
I just remembered
I have a parcel to collect.

98
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,890
Why is the box so big?

99
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,700
Why is it you again?

100
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,010
Did you forget we live across
from each other?

101
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,820
Do you need help?

102
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,050
It's fine. It's not heavy.

103
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,050
I meant to help you hold your boba tea.

104
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,660
There's no need.

105
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm afraid of making you tired.

106
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,380
Wait.

107
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
You...

108
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,450
Be careful.

109
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,450

110
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,890

111
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,050
Slow down.

112
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,540
Look out for the cart.

113
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,380
Our apologies...

114
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,100
There's a bicycle on your right.

115
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,260
Our apologies.

116
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,100
It's fine.

117
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,890
You're a man,

118
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,290

119
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,380
Instead, you're acting as her guide dog.

120

121
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,260

122
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,260
Is the boba tea tasty?

123
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,450
You hold it...

124
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,580
What are you looking at, guide dog?

125
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,980
This is to be taken
to the back gate of the area.

126
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,420
What is it?

127
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,540
A kennel for stray dogs

128
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,890
to provide shelter
from the wind and rain.

129
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,700
I've already talked to the management.

130
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,010
The kennel will be placed here.

131
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,940
Okay.

132
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,860
Let me help you set it up.

133
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,890
You go back.

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,260
Do you want me to set it up?

135
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,820
I started this, after all.

136
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,450
It's fine. I can do it alone.

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,890
Okay. Let me show it to you then.

138
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,730
It's this type.

139
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,260
The foldable kind? It'll be quick.

140
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,050
Don't worry.

141
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,010
Okay. Good luck then.

142
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,610
You can check on the results tomorrow
when you walk past.

143
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,660
Isn't it meant to be foldable?

144
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,980
The front gate.

145
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,380
The back gate.

146
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,050
There is no screwdriver included.

147

149
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,050
How can you say torment?

150
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,260
He looks quite willing, doesn't he?

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,940
Anyway, in most dramas during this time,

152
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,970
It's only torment

153
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,780
there will be heavy rain

154
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,140
and a heavy downpour.

155
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,610
I think I see lightning.

156
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,380
Amazing.

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,900

158

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,410
Okay. Bye.

160
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,090
Should I

161
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,650
bring him an umbrella?

162
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,900
How is his health any of my business?

163

See you.

166
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,820
As expected.

167
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,940
I just knew he wouldn't be here
the entire time.

168
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,140
Why are you here?

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,260
I come to check your work.

170
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,050
Didn't I come here just in time

171
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,700
to see you give up?

172
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,170
I went to grab a torch.

173
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,970
You should head home.

174
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,410
It gets cold when it rains.

175
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,090
Don't worry.

176
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,780
It will be done before tomorrow morning.

177
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,140

366
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,980
Okay.

367
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,860
I want to add you too.

368
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,100
I'll go add her.

369
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,740
Let me add you too.

370
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,860
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,980
I didn't mean it.

372
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,740
Are you okay?

373
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,770
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine...

374
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,860
She plays really badly.

375
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,050
When you want to play, add me in.

376
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,890
They recently released a new set

377
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,010
of rare equipment.

378
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,770
I'll make sure you all get a set each.

379
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,860
Really?

380
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,890
Of course.

381
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,740
You have to keep your word.

382
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,010
I definitely will.

383
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,740
This is great.

384
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,820
I really wanted that set.

385
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,410
- Right?
- I've always wanted that.

386
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,980
I could never get it.

387
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,050
Here.

388
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,250
Eat more tonight.

389
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,050
Today,

390
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,250
the interview was a great success.

391
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,580
Not only

392
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
did we complete our mission,

393
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,130
but we've also won some extra
free advertising.

394
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,620
There's still one thing.

395
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,170
I'll have to personally pay
for their equipment.

396
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,460
It's all my fault.

397
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,170
I messed up.

398
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,010
Chen Xinyi.

399
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,770
Being introverted

400
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,820
is fine.

401
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,460
If you're inexperienced,
I can train you.

402
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,410
If there's a problem,
we'll overcome it together.

403
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,010
You must not ever retreat
in the face of adversity

404
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,460
and give up.

405
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,340
Come, a toast.

406
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,050
Did Mr. Jiang

407
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,130
see my resignation letter?

408
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,050
Why are you spacing out?

409
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,530
Pour me more wine.

410
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,620
Oh, right.

411
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,820
You

412
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,130
are under me.

413
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,500
I'll protect you if there's a problem,

414
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,460
but there's just one thing.

415
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,860
You must speak up if there's anything.

416
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,170
Don't be scared.

417
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,650
Then,

418
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,770
what should I do?

419
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,290
What should you do?

420
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,340
Let's first train up your courage
by getting you to order food.

421
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,890
Order from the shop

422
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,740
five intestines and five kidneys.

423
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,980
Order food?

424
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,770
Excuse me.

425
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,050
Five intestines and five kidneys.

426
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,770
No way. Your voice is too low.

427
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,530
I can't even hear you.

428
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,860
How can the shop owner hear you?

429
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,130
Louder.

430
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,580
Excuse me.

431
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,010
Five intestines and five kidneys.

432
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,010
Not enough.

433
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,580
Excuse me.

434
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,500
Five intestines and five kidneys.

435
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,340
Louder.

436
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,100
Five intestines and five kidneys!

437
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,740
Alright. Heard...

438
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,460
That's right.

439
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,130
Come.

440
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,530
Another toast.

441
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,250
Okay.

442
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,650
Let's.

443
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,370
Mr. Jiang is a good man.

444
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,170
I'll stick with him

445
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,290
and not leave.

446
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,220
Eat up.

447
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,890
Hey. Delivery?

448
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,740
You can just put it
on the takeaway shelf.

449
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,220
Okay. Thank you.

450
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,820
[Dream on]

451
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,530
How's the new home?

452
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,740
Comfortable?

453
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,770
Sleep well.

454
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,340
I didn't expect her to be
into Triple-A games

455
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,530
because of me.

456
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,580
Today's fried chicken is delicious.

457
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,770
The water is sweet as well.

458
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,250
Sir,

459
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,820
you said you put the takeaway
on the shelf,

460
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,580
but it's not there at all.

461
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,650
It's not on my shoe rack,

462
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,460
and it's not by my door.

463
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,580
The food I ordered is really important.

464
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,860
You don't know?

465
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,050
If you don't know, who should I call?

466
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,700
How would I know...

467
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,340
Hello?

468
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,740
You lost your delivery?

469
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,770
Don't you think

470
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,530
you're too close to my apartment door?

471
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,170
Why don't I check the cameras with you?

472
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,290
Perhaps we can find it.

473
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,050
Sure.

474
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,220
If I find out who took my delivery,

475
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,620
I'll kill him.

476
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,580
Is it precious?

477
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,500
Of course. There are only 10,000 sets
in the whole country.

478
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,460
Someone else must have taken it.

479
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,890
Call the police now.

480
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,370
If someone stole it,

481
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,580
I know a few lawyers.

482
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,770
I can introduce them to you.

483
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,100
This is the one.

484
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,100
Do we only

485
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,940
have 10,000 pieces
of fried chicken left in the country?

486
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,740
It's the limited edition set
for "Empresses in the Palace".

487
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,980
I made sure to order on the dot
for one of the 10,000 sets.

488
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,220
It was you, Gu Xun.

489
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,620
No.

490
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,410
There must be a mistake.

491
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,460
I grabbed my food. I...

492
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,500
Hello?

493
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,250
I'm so sorry, Sir.

494
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,890
I delivered your food to the wrong area.

495
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,410
By the time I returned for it,

496
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,220
the other person had already eaten it.

497
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm so sorry. I'll compensate you later.

498
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,010
No wonder there was only one bag

499
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,370
when I went to grab it.

500
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,740
I want a lawyer.

501
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,860
I...

502
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,290
How is it gone?

503
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,100
I...

504
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,620
Why didn't you check the name

505
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,130
when you grabbed the bag?

506
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,530
When the delivery person called me,

507
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,940
there was only one bag there.

508
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,370
I saw that it was what I ordered, so...

509
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,820
Why don't I get you another?

510
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,940
No. I'll get you a whole set in return.

511
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,820
How?

512
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,500
There are eight of them

513
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,250
and only 10,000 sets.

514
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,250
They don't get restocked.

515
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,050
How will you compensate me?

516
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,580
If I collect them all,

517
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,290
will you consider my suggestion?

518
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,340
Sure,

519
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,290
but

520
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,250
you can't buy it second-hand

521
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,050
or through an agent.

522
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,220
If you collect them all yourself,

523
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,530
I might just reconsider it.

524
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,890
After all, that shows sincerity.

525
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,620
It will be better
if you find the secret figure too.

526
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,940
Sure.

527
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,220
Eating fried chicken is easy,

528
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,250
but gathering the empresses is hard.

529
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,620
How can I believe the word
of a man like that?

530
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,460
I'll call for a taxi later.

531
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,290
We'll drop you off first.

532
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,290
It's safer.

533
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,820
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

534
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,370
Chen Xinyi.

535
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,740
You know kung fu?

536
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,250
I was trained in karate.

537
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,820
I really liked watching Konan as a kid.

538
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,050
I liked Lan,

539
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,290
so I took classes.

540
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,650
Your eighth-grader syndrome

541
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,170
lasted over a decade.

542
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,580
It's quite cute.

543
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,500
As I studied,
it became a great de-stressor,

544
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,860
so I kept at it.

545
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,170
It looks like I'll have

546
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,980
to get to know you anew.

547
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,620
Let's go.

548
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,940
Sleep Till Wake is Yue Qianling?

549
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,820
Gu Xun, you must be cursed.

550
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,410
The enemies you made
are the same person.

551
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,460
Honestly speaking,

552

I've ordered from them for five days,

586
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,530

More accurately,

592
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,580
he threw one of mine away

593
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,410
and promised to give me a whole set.

594
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,620

595
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,340
You got it through deceit, right?

596
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,050
He did it willingly, okay?

597
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,860
This friend of yours

598

603

with just completing our daily tasks.

610
