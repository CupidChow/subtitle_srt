00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,250

378

if I answered your video call,

380

to share?

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,290
Anything else?

557
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,220
The art group

558
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,650
has completed the three-view drawing
of the male protagonist Ming Chen.

559
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,100
As for Lin Zhi, the progress

560
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,740
will depend on the pace
of our new artist.

561
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,010
Qianling.

562
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,500
Let me introduce

563
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
the newest addition to our unit.

564
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,580
Yue Qianling,

565
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,700
an artist from Project Department 1.

566
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,250
Hello, everyone.

567
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,500
My name is Yue Qianling.

568
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,010
Let's give a round of applause.

569
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,530
Yue Qianling,

570
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,130
you'll be working under Fan Xing.

571
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,460
She's the group leader

572
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,170
and was the artist for Lin Zhi
in the previous version.

573
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,130
Understood.

574
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,100
Why don't you
share your thoughts on the direction

575
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,050
for Lin Zhi's character development?

576
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,460
The last rendition

577
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,860
of Lin Zhi

578
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,410
was excellent.

579
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,460
It has a very distinctive style.

580
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,050
I want to highlight Lin Zhi's

581
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,580
character traits more.

582
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,130
Since she is a chivalrous woman

583
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,890
who robs the rich to help the poor,

584
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,370
I want to enhance

585
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,620
her heroic spirit.

586
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,290
There might also be adjustments

587
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,820
in her clothing style.

588
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,580
As we've discussed before,

589
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,370
Lin Zhi seems

590
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,410
very powerful,

591
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,050
but she doesn't look
down-to-earth enough.

592
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,940
I believe

593
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,170
a true heroine should embody
the spirit of the common folk.

594
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,250
That's the angle I propose we explore.

595
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,100
This approach

596
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,250
would enrich

597
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,250
her Eastern aesthetic appeal.

598
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,050
Is this feasible?

599
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,980
Who is she to be a part-timer here?

600
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,940
Might as well ask us to start over.

601
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,290
Exactly. What a waste of time.

602
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,620
I think Yue Qianling has a point there.

603
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,370
Character design should closely align
with the game's worldview.

604
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,170
Regarding Lin Zhi's design,

605
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,740
as we mentioned before,

606
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,770
she has ample strength

607
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,820
but lacks gentleness.

608
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,580
So I think this is viable.

609
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,250
I also think it's worth a try.

610
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,860
Mobile game designs have
a lighter touch for main elements,

611
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,700
which is precisely what we're missing.

612
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,500
A bit more creative collision

613
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,940
could lead to something new.

614
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,620
Right.

615
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,010
Yue Qianling,

616
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,340
proceed with your idea

617
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,100
and produce a draft for us.

618
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,050
I will.

619
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,370
The workstations are all taken.

620
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,580
Just make do and sit next to me for now.

621
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,340
If there's anything you don't understand,
just ask me.

622
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,370
- Well...
- I need to get back to work now.

623
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,220
I heard she used to work
under the Chief Game Graphic Designer.

624
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,700
When the art group was hiring,

625
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,050
she also participated in the competition

626
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,820
but she lost to Fan Xing.

627
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,460
Handing such an important project

628
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,740
to a part-timer?

629
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,650
I don't get it.

630
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,740
Yue Qianling,

631
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
come with me for a moment.

632
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,650
Maybe she won't even be able
to finish the artwork in the end

633
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,530
and will have to rely
on Fan Xing for help.

634
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,290
How are we going to make these changes?

635
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,620
I want to work on this too.

636
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,860
Yue Qianling,

637
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,340
I don't care how capable you were

638
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,170
in Project Department 1

639
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,050
or how much Mr. Wei valued you.

640
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:40,940
Here,

641
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,980
ability is the only standard
we measure by.

642
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,770
I understand.

643
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,530
As the group leader, let me remind you.

644
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,890
In a Triple-A game project,
you can't just draw on your own.

645
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,890
Before you start, you need to communicate
with the planning group

646
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,410
and also with the 3D group.

647
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,530
I understand.

648
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,410
Thanks, Ms. Fan.

649
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,460
If you don't do well...

650
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
Don't worry.

651
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,100
If it comes to a situation
where I need you to save the day,

652
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,460
I will leave on my own.

653
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,100
But

654
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,980
that won't happen.

655
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,980
As long as you know that.

656
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,620
Why so aggressive?

657
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,940
But she's right.

658
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,620
I didn't communicate
with the 3D and the planning groups

659
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,980
before starting.

660
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,290
How could I be so stupid?

661
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,620
Feeling sorry for her?

662
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,700
It's all part of the experience.

663
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,250
It's okay.

664
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,290
I've got her back.

665
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,220
No,

666
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,820
you've got her back.

667
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,650
By the way,

668
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,290
regarding today's company notice,

669
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,980
it seems that our unit
is determined to win.

670
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,410
They also sent us details
about several promising lead designers.

671
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,500
Do you want to meet them?

672
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,980
No need.

673
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,100
No need?

674
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,740
Do you have a candidate in mind?

675
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,860
You have a wide range of interests.

676
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,620
Mr. Gu?

677
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,530
I've loved reading all kinds of books
since I was a child.

678
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,290
My dad was a librarian

679
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,580
in my hometown,

680
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,220
so I spent a lot of time
in the library as a kid.

681
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,410
So your attention to detail

682
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,980
was also developed
from a young age as well?

683
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,050
Yeah.

684
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,740
This is...

685
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,620
This is a detailed plan

686
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,650
for the ancient architecture
in "Hero's Path".

687
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,700
Isn't this confidential
business information?

688
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,530
It won't be if you join

689
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,340
the 9th Business Unit.

690
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,500
Think about it.

691
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,940
You can keep the plan.

692
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,820
How many of the things
you mentioned just now

693
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,010
would our players actually care about?

694
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,410
But isn't the male protagonist
supposed to be...

695
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,340
I know.

696
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,700
But we need to hit the right note
with our players

697
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,500
to bring in more revenue.

698
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,220
Master,

699
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,050
I was actually thinking...

700
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,410
No need to think anymore.

701
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,700
Go make the changes.

702
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,290
Don't make me remind you
again and again.

703
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,340
This design

704
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,650
isn't just a tribute
to the Epang Palace, right?

705
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,650
Because I really like

706
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,340
studying ancient architecture
of various styles,

707
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,130
so I was thinking

708
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,250
about mixing them all

709
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,460
to see
if I could create something unique.

710
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,340
But I don't think this is in line

711
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,220
with the core needs
of Project Department 1, is it?

762
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,220
For this version of Lin Zhi,

763
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,740
I used simpler color blocks

764
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,260
and added some darker elements

765
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,700
to create a sense of distance.

766
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,780
For her clothing,

767
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
I incorporated some soft gauze

768
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,370
to soften
her overall powerful appearance,

769
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,090
giving her a more down-to-earth feel.

770
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,650
I think this draft
is completely unacceptable.

771
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,330
Yes, you made some adjustments,

772
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,220
but you haven't stepped out
of the previous draft.

773
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,090
It looks like the same character

774
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,300
with a different outfit.

775
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,850
But in terms of style,

776
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,170
I've made a breakthrough.

777
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,500
Look at this part.
I've already changed...

778
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,130
Alright.

779
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,020
Speaking of style,

780
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,260
your use of color blocks
is not bold enough.

781
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,500
There's no tension
in the overall picture.

782
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,610
About the color blocks,

783
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,740
I don't think all characters

784
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,220
need to be represented
with contrasting colors to...

785
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,020
Colors are used to reflect
the characters' personalities

786
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,410
and even their temperatments.

787
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,650
In this draft, I can't see

788
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,610
any details that reflect

789
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,890
the bearing of a jianghu heroine
that you want to portray.

790
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,460
There's no contrast
in color temperature,

791
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,220
and the colors are too pale.

792
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,330
I can't tell the focus at all.

793
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,570
In terms of the character's
expressions and movements,

794
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,810
there's no tension

795
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,540
or detail,

796
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,090
and the bone structure
is not reflected either.

797
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,500
So, as it stands,

798
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,260
Lin Zhi has only a skin.

799
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,020
She's got neither skeleton
nor the vitality she should display.

800
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,170
You'll have to forgive me.

801
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,610
I'm a straight shooter.

802
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,780
Don't take this personally,

803
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,090
but we really can't afford
to let this character design drag on.

804
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,170
I suggest

805
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,170
we assign Lin Zhi's design

806
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,370
to a more capable artist.

807
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,090
The portrayal is too bland.

808
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,220
It really won't work.

809
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,570
It's not what we need at all.

810
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,500
- Unusable.
- Exactly.

811
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,330
The style doesn't even match our game.

812
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,570
Just let someone more capable handle it,

813
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,850
or it'll hold us back.

814
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,850
Right.

815
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,260
Indeed, this initial draft

816
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,170
is only 40% there.

817
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,410
Fan Xing's comments are very insightful.

818
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,060
Take some time to digest them

819
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,090
and come up with a new draft.

820
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,810
I will.

821
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,410
That's it for today's meeting.

822
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,170
You can all leave now.

823
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,220
[Su Zheng]
Qianling,

824
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,570
can I ask you something in private?

825
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,650
How are things
over at the 9th Business Unit?

826
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,740
Is it worth joining?

827
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,570
[Yue Qianling]
It's good.

828
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,370
If you really want challenges,
come join us.

829
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,890
Come in.

830

Take a seat.

831
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Very good.

832
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,650
This version of worldview
is very well-designed.

833
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,780
It fits the tone of our game perfectly.

834
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,940
I promise you.

835
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,300
Once this version is completed,

836
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,500
I'll promote you to lead designer.

837
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,460
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

838
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,940
Master...

839
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,940
Get to the point.

840
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,890
Whenever you call me Master,
I know something's not right.

841
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,610
I want to join the 9th Business Unit.

842
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,540
You must be joking.

843
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,220
Are you sure about this?

844
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,850
What has Gu Xun promised you?

845
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,260
I'll give you double
of whatever he offered.

846
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,810
He didn't promise me anything.

847
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,810
It's just that I can work
on a Triple-A game there.

848
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,540
Do you think it's that easy
to make a Triple-A game?

849
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,060
Master,

850
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,940
I...

851
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,090
have been working
for you for five years,

852
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,330
right?

853
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,370
But I've always felt

854
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,500
that I'm getting further away
from what I want to do.

855
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,300
Su Zheng,

856
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,370
every initial draft you've given me

857
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,300
shows the possibility
of a Triple-A game.

858
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,060
It's not that I can't see it.

859
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,780
I just don't want you to waste your time

860
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,370
on something impossible.

861
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:38,890
Do you understand?

862
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,130
Then why not give me a chance

863
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,740
to try?

864
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,130
I would really regret it if I didn't.

865
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,650
Did Gu Xun brainwash you or something?

866
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,020
No,

867
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,980
but I do see

868
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,700
some potential in him.

Until now,

870
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,220

00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,330
please just give me a chance.

How long do you want to try?

How much time do you have to waste?

876
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,850
A year.

for incorporating ancient architecture

that you gave me last time.

[Concept of Inn Set]

895
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Not bad.

yet innovative.

Let's hear it.

901
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,090
I want to be the lead designer.

902
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,700
Lead designer?

903
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,850
But you're not even the lead designer
of Project Department 1.

904
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,260
But I don't think there is anyone

905

more suitable than me for the role
in the 9th Business Unit,

906
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,130
right?

907
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,570

Thank you for your trust, Mr. Gu.

from Jiang Yishi.

over the project budgets.

00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,850
why didn't you try to smooth things over
in the meeting?

920
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,850
Just so people wouldn't say

921
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,940
she got here because of connections?

922
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,090
Her draft isn't good enough.

923
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,460
It's normal for people to talk.

924
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,170
When her content deserves recognition,

925
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,650
people will naturally shut up.

926
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,020
And...

927
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,220
was I really...

928
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,370
that harsh?

929
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,020
I thought I was being diplomatic.

930
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,940
With so many employees there,

931
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,060
as a..., you know,

932
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,090
I can't be

933
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,460
too...

934
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,890
You know what I mean.

935
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,020
I'll go talk to the lead designer now.

936
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,130
Go.

937
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,300
[Can you believe I spent three days
on these two pieces of clothing?]

938
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,540
Its mouth is torn.

939
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,020
It's okay.

940
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,060
A staple will fix it right up.

941
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,460
Let me sew it for you.

942
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:39,980
Thank you.

943
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,410
That's amazing.

944
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,090
It's as good as new.

945
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,740
I didn't know you were good at crafts.

946
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,220
I like

947
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,570
to make costumes as a hobby.

948
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
This was bought

949
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,810
when I joined the company.

950
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,650
Back then, I thought I was
exceptionally talented.

951
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,650
Now it seems

952
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,130
I'm really nothing special.

953
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:53,980
Have faith in yourself!

954
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,540
Thank you, Xinyi.

955
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,460
Xinyi,

956
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,610
how's it going with the cosplay costumes
for the company anniversary?

957
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,540
Almost all of them have been sent out.

958
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,850
Good for you.

959
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,650
Others couldn't pull it off,

960
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,130
but we managed to get it done.

961
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,460
You must have spent
a lot of time on cosplay.

962
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,090
Here's a payment agreement.

963
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,610
Please let Stella review it.

964
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,890
The client has been pushing for it.

965
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,460
Get her to sign it as soon as possible.

966
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,330
She's heading out soon.

967
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,260
You should go now.

968
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,060
Why are you still here?

969
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,610
Stella doesn't bite you.

970
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,020
It's also a good opportunity
to increase your exposure.

971
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:52,460
Xinyi,

972
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,570
are you and Jiang Junnan...?

973
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,060
No, we're not.

974
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,260
Really?

975
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,170
So you have a crush on him?

976
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,940
