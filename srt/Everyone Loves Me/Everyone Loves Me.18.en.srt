00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,910
or is it Hero's Path?

193
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,660
Mr. Gu,

194
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,300
Project Department 1 took the booth.

195
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,110
How could they do this?

196
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,910
I will give everyone an explanation.

197
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,910
I've thought about this strategy
for a long time.

198
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,510
The whole industry is declining.

199
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,820
For HC Interactive,

200
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,460
we need this boost.

201
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,540
You gave the booth to someone else

202
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,350
before the promo video was released.

203
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,230
I want to know why.

204
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,990
Mr. Gu,

205
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,390
calm down.

206
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,540
It's like this.

207
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,110
We just released

208
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,940
the key animation of the four male leads
of The Love Broker.

209
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,110
Surprisingly, the fans love them.

210
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,030
I suggest we make topping up available

211
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,750
during the expo

212
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,660
so the company will have
a huge amount of cash flow.

213
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,580
Cash flow is all we want now?

214
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,910
Mr. Gu, are you saying
cash flow isn't important?

215
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,390
We did an online survey beforehand.

216
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,870
More than 10 hours
after the key animation was released,

217
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,300
more than three million people
expressed their will to top up.

218
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,180
With the help of the expo's promotion,

219
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,990
the numbers will increase further.

220
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,910
Is this the reason?

221
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,420
Since Stella has already approved it,

222
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,540
I believe this reason is valid.

Gu Xun.

224
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,660
As a decision-maker in the company,

225
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,750
I need to consider many factors.

226
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,420
Besides,

227
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,780
I think the passion
of Triple-A game fans

228
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,110
won't be affected by external factors

229
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,460
such as the booth.

230
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,510
The remaining booth might be small

231
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,940
but there's a lot of hype
for Hero's Path.

232
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700

233
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,030

237
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,780

238
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,700
They are too big indeed.

239
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,540
We need to make them smaller.

376
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,630
Let's go.

377
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,420
[Hero's Path]

378
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,820
[The Love Broker]

379
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,660
Xinyi will go on stage soon.

380
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,910
I feel so nervous.

381
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,110
Are you all right?

382
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,020
Using the sword in hand
as a guiding light forever,

383
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,980
light up the Hero's Path!

384
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,940
Lin Zhi,

385
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,260
can you hear me?

386
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,700
I've found a way
to separate two timelines.

387
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,830
Protect or kill?

388
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,790
Separate or coexist?

389
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,910
In this era,

390
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,500
life is fragile.

391
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,020
Only the hero survives forever.

392
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,350
Amazing!

393
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,550
Incredible!

394
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,740
Enough.

395
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,180
Stop clapping.

396
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,390
- Great!
- Great!

397
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,110
We will show everyone...

398
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,910
Show everyone the best work
in the shortest time possible.

399
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,180
There won't be a problem
during the launch, huh?

400
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,870
Don't worry.

401
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,660
We've put a lot of effort
into this project.

402
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,150
We will do our best.

403
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,910
Lin Zhi's expression was so realistic.

404
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,420
There's also a multiplayer mode.

405
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,790
That mode has never been seen before

406
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,150
in other domestic games.

407
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,980
Every detail in Hero's Path

408
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,830
will be superior

409
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,830
to any games you've played.

410
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,150
Apart from the design of the posters...

411
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,390
Doesn't that handsome guy look
especially handsome?

412
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,700
There will be new designs

413
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,980
at every new level.

414
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,790
Go and ask him.

415
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,700
Give this bottle to him

416
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,180
and see
if you can get his WeChat contact.

417
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,660
All right. Let's go.

418
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,420
Regarding Lin Zhi,

419
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,550
our design is inspired
by the Oriental...

420
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,590
Hello. You can ask me
if you have any questions.

421
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,980
Let me help you.

422
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,550
We want to ask...

423
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,420
He is busy.

424
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,020
Forget it. Let's go.

425
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,500
You can ask

426
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,980
our Chief Game Graphic Designer
the remaining questions.

427
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,460
Fan Xing. Wei Han. Come here.

428
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,700
Was someone looking for me?

429
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,660
I thought I heard my name.

430
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,660
No.

431
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,390
No?

432
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,310
I saw...

433
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,180
No.

434
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,630
No!

435
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,110
No?

436
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,260
I saw the two...

437
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,870
No!

438
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,070
- I saw there was...
- No!

439
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,110
No!

440
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,180
Are you sure?

441
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,390
Yes.

442
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,460
I'm going to the toilet.

443
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,420
That's too far.

444
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,940
Did you see it?

445
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,350
After the promotional video was played,

446
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,260
the whole place erupted.

447
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,740
It was quite impressive.

448
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,150
The company provided them

449
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,110
with the best resources.

450
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,550
If we did well,

451
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,180
they wouldn't be able
to enjoy the resources.

452
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,910
Did you see

453
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,310
Mr. Jiang's face just now?

454
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,390
So gloomy!

455
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,630
I saw it.

456
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,910
Indeed.

457
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,180
- I was so scared.
- His face was so gloomy.

458
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,150
I saw him and I felt...

459
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Whose face was gloomy?

460
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,980
- Our face.
- Our face.

461
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,910
With your working attitude
and your excuses,

462
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,420
you won't be able to win against them

463
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,590
even if you have all the resources.

464
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,700
Go and learn from them.

465
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,660
I'll go and learn from them immediately.

466
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,700
Let's go and learn from them.

467
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,460
That kid is quite capable.

468
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,660
Mr. Jiang, are you praising us?

469
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,700
Which one of your ears
picked up what I said?

470
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
This one and this one.

471
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,790
- They both heard it.
- Get lost.

472
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,220
Hello. Can I take a picture with you?

473
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,630
Sure.

474
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,390
All right. Look over here.

475
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,980
Three. Two. One.

476
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,790
Come.

477
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,220
You have low blood sugar.

478
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,740
You should eat something.

479
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,700
When I made Lin Zhi's battle suit,

480
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,940
I reduced the waistline
by two centimeters.

481
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,150
I need to suck in my tummy to wear it.

482
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,790
Drink some water at least.

483
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,150
I can't.

484
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,660
If I drink, my stomach will expand.

485
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,310
Have you seen a female game character
with a bloated stomach?

486
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,980
You still have two shows. Can you do it?

487
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,740
I can do it.

488
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,830
I have to do it even if I can't.

489
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,460
I have to go now.

490
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,070
You should rest a while more.

491
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,790
Xinyi.

492
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,460
Have some chocolate.

493
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Why do I taste sweetness

494
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,350
when I see him?

495
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,870
Xinyi, are you all right?

496
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,220
You just woke up. Don't move so much.

497
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,790
You will get dizzy easily.

498
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,150
Mr. Jiang.

499
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,660
Where's Qianling?

500
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,980
I asked her to go to work.

501
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,420
Look.

502
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,630
I like your work ethic

503
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,420
but you can't risk your life for it.

504
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,350
Right?

505
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,830
I feel much better. It's all right.

506
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,150
Here.

507
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,150
Eat the chocolate.

508
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,420
No, thanks.

509
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,550
I'm on a diet.

510
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,310
This is an order.

511
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,150
You must eat it.

512
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,420
Besides, you are not fat.

513
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,830
I think you look good.

514
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,390
Really?

515
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,310
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

516
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,630
Let me bring you some tea.

517
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,500
Here.

518
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,830
Have some rest.

519
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,550
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

520
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,660
I realized

521
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,220
you look different today.

522
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,070
How so?

523
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,980
There are so many people here today.

524
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,220
What you did just now...

525
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,310
That one.

526
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,980
You looked like a heroine.

527
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,070
It was great.

528
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,020
I...

529
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,220
When I cosplay a character,

530
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,260
I feel
like a completely different person.

531
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,910
I don't feel nervous at all.

532
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
I can't believe
there's this side to you.

533
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,420
Do you have

534
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,070
other sides that I haven't seen before?

535
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,070
No.

536
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,870
Not at all.

537
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,790
Do you feel better?

538
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,630
Much better.

539
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,390
All right. Rest well.

540
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,390
I'll get back to work.

541
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,310
All right.

542
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,020
Have some chocolate.

543
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,070
Thank you.

544
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,390
Thank you to all the guests
who came here today.

545
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,110
I can feel your passion.

546
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,150
Up next,

547
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,660
let's invite
the organizer of this Games Expo,

548
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,260
William,

549
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,790
to present the expo's

550
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,180
Most Popular Game Character Award

551
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,870
and the Most Popular Game Award.

552
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,180
These two awards

553
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,350
are voted anonymously

554
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,070
by today's visitors.

555
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,700
Let's give a round of applause

556
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,630
to welcome William!

557
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,830
First of all,

558
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,790
let's reveal the winner

559
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,700
of the Most Popular
Game Character Award.

560
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,630
Let's congratulate
Lin Zhi from Hero's Path!

561
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,070
Congratulations!

562
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,740
Amazing!

563
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,460
Yue Qianling, go and accept the award.

564
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,630
- You are the key animator.
- Me?

565
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,980
Who will go if not you?

566
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,700
Go ahead.

567
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,220
Go.

568
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,180
- Go.
- Go on.

569
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,420
Thank you.

570
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,460
Qianling!

571
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,740
Enough.

572
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,220
All right.

573
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,550
The most anticipated moment

574
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,830
is upon us.

575
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,590
The Most Popular Game Award

576
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,980
goes to a game
that hasn't been published yet.

577
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,630
However, I was shocked

578
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,180
by its promotional video.

579
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,830
It is not inferior to any games

580
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,740
I've seen at the Games Expos overseas.

581
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,870
It is

582
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,150
Hero's Path!

583
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,980
Congratulations!

584
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,660
Congratulations. Please come
onto the stage to accept the award.

585
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,660
Thank you.

586
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,700
Good job.

587
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,350
First of all,

588
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,660
I want to thank every colleague of mine

589
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,110
who has worked hard for Hero's Path.

590
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,590
We've experienced
many adversities this year.

591
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,220
Your persistence

592
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,100
allows us to hold on until today.

593
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
I also want to thank everyone

594
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,790
who supports Hero's Path.

595
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,420
We will not let you down.

596
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,100
All right.

597
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,420
Let us invite the development team

598
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,230
of Hero's Path to come onto the stage

599
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,500
for a group picture.

600
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,350
- Let's go.
- Come on. Let's go.

601
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,390
Time to leave.

602
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,500
I have always wanted to leave anyway.

603
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,750
The 34th winner is Hero's Path.

604
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,750
We deserve the award.

605
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,980
Good job, everyone.

606
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,190
Gu Xun.

607
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,500
Mr. Gu.

608
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,830
- It has been a long time.
- It has been a long time.

609
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,830
Congratulations.

610
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,140
Hero's Path is really great.

611
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,310
It's been a year.

612
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,910
You were a university student back then

613
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,500
but you are a leader now.

614
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,460
Your Hero's Path

615
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,670
is...

616
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,460
It's an eye-opener for me.

617
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,750
It's so well done.

618
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,710
I knew

619
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,580
you had talent.

620
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,710
You are young and capable.

621
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,310
Mr. Gu, great job there.

622
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,350
Thank you.

623
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,670
Thank you.

624
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,140
I came

625
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,870
to propose something to you.

626
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,270
I believe

627
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,230
Walter Games shares the same vision

628
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,190
with you, Mr. Gu.

629
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,540
We also want to develop
a local Triple-A title

630
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,910
and we've invested in a few companies.

631
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,020
However, the result was unsatisfactory.

632
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
I think

633
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,460
if you join Walter Games,

634
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,670
it will be a great boost

635
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,750
to the domestic development
of Triple-A titles.

636
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,460
I appreciate Walter Games' support

637
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,980
of me and Hero's Path.

638
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,310
However,

639
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,230
I currently plan
to stay with HC Interactive

640
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,910
so that Hero's Path can be published
as soon as possible.

641
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,020
As for the rest,

642
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,140
I won't consider it at the moment.

643
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,540
As expected of Mr. Gu,

644
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,310
you are so courteous.

645
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,540
Are you sure
you don't want to reconsider?

646
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,790
I hope we meet again.

647
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,980
What's wrong?

648
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,620
Are you all right?

649
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,390
Take a stroll with me.

650
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,580
Mr. Jiang, you are so great.

651
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,940
Yes.

652
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,710
Let me touch the trophy again.

653
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,540
Come here.

654
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,790
How are you feeling?

655
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,500
Hello,

656
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,540
do you want

657
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,500
to test your luck in love recently?

658
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,620
As in fortune telling?

659
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,980
No, it's a test of love.

660
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,420
Otome games?

661
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,980
I don't think it suits me.

662
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,390
Mr. Gu, do you want to try it?

663
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,540
I...

664
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,460
I'll do it.

665
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,540
I'll do it.

666
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,060
Let's take a look

667
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,020
at your luck in love recently.

668
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,350
Love test.

669
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,870
Qianling,

670
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,100
do you like these love tests too?

671
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,100
I want to find out my luck in love.

672
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,890
You will not be single for much longer.

673
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,500
The answers are randomly given.

674
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,750
It's not accurate, right?

675
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,460
It's very accurate.

676
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,540
Try it again.

677
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Quick.

678
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,910
Within three days?

679
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,670
- Within three days?
- Within three days?

680
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,750
- How accurate is this test?
- How accurate is this test?

681
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,540
This test is very accurate.

682
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,270
Let's drop the test. Let's go.

683
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,980
We are home.

684
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,790
The love test

685
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,540
has existed since I was in university.

686
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,100
I can't believe so many people
still take it nowadays.

687
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,020
I'm sure it has its reasons
for being so popular.

688
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,910
Perhaps

689
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,750
the test is quite accurate.

690
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,060
A test like this

691
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,500
targets teen girls' longing for love.

692
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,670
The answers are randomly given.

693
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,670
And every answer gives a little hope.

694
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,910
Naturally, more and more people
take the test.

695
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,980
You are right.

696
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,020
I never took it seriously anyway.

697
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,940
[Gu Xun]
Did you do what I asked you to?

698
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,750
I'll be there soon.

699
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,500
[Jiang Junnan]
I've prepared everything.

700
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,420
The stage is yours now.

701
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Am I just worth an emoji?

702
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,310
Good luck with your confession!

703
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,420
I'll wait for your good news.

704
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,750
We've worked for the entire day.

705
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,420
What do you feel like eating?

706
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,940
What about noodles?

707
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,310
Anything is fine.

708
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,140
Then,

709
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,310
why don't you go upstairs
and wait for me?

710
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,500
Sure.

711
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,710
He must be preparing

712
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,190
for a confession.

713
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,060
I'm sure

714
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,310
he asked Jiang Junnan to help him
when he was in the car.

715
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,580
He sure is quite sweet.

716
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,500
I thought about many ways
to do this confession.

717
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,190
But I think

718
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,980
this is the best.

719
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,870
Do you remember

720
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,940
when we first played games,

721
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,310
you called me a noob?

722
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,500
Every day, I feel the happiest

723
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,980

I don't want to give up.

754
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,060
Hello.

755
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,670
How did it go?

756
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,060
Did Dough Twist say yes?

757
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,460
I didn't confess.

758
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,270
Why?

759
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,230
A confession under the stars
would be so romantic.

760
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,310
Are you not satisfied with the decor?

761
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,830
Su Zheng confessed to her first.

762
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,460
Yue Qianling doesn't like him.

763
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,500
I'm sure she has rejected him.

764
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,710
Quick. Strike when the iron is hot.

765
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,500
I won't confess
on the same day as he did.

766
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,710
It brings bad luck.

767
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,100
I won't say a word he used.

768
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,140
Listen.

769
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,020
You must be bold for your first love.

770
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,100
You need to be shameless
if you want her.

771
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,870
I'm hanging up.

772
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,460
You said you lost your appetite
and didn't want to eat.

773
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,870
So I got a take out to eat with you.

774
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,790
Why are you panting?

775
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,670
Why don't you turn on the lights?

776
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,940
It's fine. Let's eat.

777
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,710
Sit.

778
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,750
What's wrong?

779
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,460
It's nothing.

780
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,750
To my surprise,

781
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,230
the test is quite accurate.

782
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,620
Someone confessed to me.

783
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,580
The test has nothing to do with it.

784
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,980
How come?

785
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,420
The test was talking
about your true love.

786
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,310
Su Zheng isn't your true love.

787
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,620
What's wrong?

788
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,540
