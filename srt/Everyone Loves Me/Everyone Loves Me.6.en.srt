00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,870
Left.

190
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,120
What are you doing?

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,510
Use the magnum sniper rifle and attack!

192
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,440
- How can I use it now?
- Shoot.

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
So many people.

194
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
Move aside.

195
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,720
You're great at this.

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,750
Do you play

197
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,790
FPS games?

198
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,550
I

199
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,960
despise games

200
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,790
that are all about killing.

201
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,750
I didn't expect you
to be so good at games.

202
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,030
Get it?

203
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,150
You played well.

204
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,240
Mr. Gu,

205
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,550
play one round with us.

206
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,270
[Feeder Boy]

207
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,030
That's not the right username.

208
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,000
How can Yue Qianling
be Sticky Dough Twist?

209
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,030
I don't play with low-ranked players.

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
It's not settled yet
who the low-ranked player is here.

211
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,270
So arrogant.

212
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,000
Who are you calling arrogant?

213
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,790
I was talking about him.

214
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,910
I'm defending you.

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,790
Thanks,

216
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,120
my dear apprentice.

217
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Play with me next time.

218
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
You played very well.

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
Okay.

220
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,790
I'm off, Shi Bo.

221
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

222
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,750
Yue Qianling.

223
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
We received your drawings afterward.

224
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,670
I can tell

225
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,720
that you've leaned
into the Eastern art style.

226
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,150
The many shades of color

227
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,840
harmonize yet stand out
at the same time.

228
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,630
You brought
the character's powerful aura to life

229
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,630
yet also showcased his anxiety
at going against an enemy.

230
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,910
I was wrong before.

231
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,960
Regardless of the praise,

232
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
it still wasn't used.

233
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,030
I told you,

234
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,150
Gu Xun is not an unreasonable man.

235
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,870
There had to be a misunderstanding.

236
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,720
Yes.

237
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,550
Gu Xun is good because of this,

238
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,320
and also because of that.

239
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Gu Xun is the best man in the world.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,270
Of course.

241
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,200
Can the man I like

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
be bad?

243
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,720
Can you still go there now?

244
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,150
To go or not,

245
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,720
that is not important.

246
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
The key is

247
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,720
that Gu Xun praised me.

248
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,270
You've come alive again.

249
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,960
That's good.

250
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,240
I hear,

251
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,080
their department

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,870
has been working late again.

253
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,390
I wonder if he had dinner yet.

254
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,960
Say,

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,480
should I deliver to him

256
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,630
some supper?

257
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,030
Why do you suddenly seem smart?

258
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,600
You know that you need
to make a move now.

259
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
The previous tactic was too subtle.

260
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,670
It was ineffective.

261
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,750
Also, I realized

262
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,600
that Gu Xun's attitude toward me
has changed.

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,480
He didn't talk to me much,

264
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,750
but now he praised me.

265
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,790
I must be more proactive

266
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,000
to

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,390
win his heart

268
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,670
as soon as possible.

269
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,150
Ambitious.

270
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,360
You need to get back on your feet.

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,630
After your delivery,

272
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,360
see if you can find a chance

273
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,720
to take it a step further.

274
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,390
Won't I

275
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,270
be moving too fast?

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,750
After all,

277
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,790
we're not officially dating yet.

278
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Wouldn't it be too soon

279
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,670
to have intimate contact?

280
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,910
Qianling,

281
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,000
is your mind in the gutter?

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,670
I meant to get him to send you home.

283
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,360
It was not.

284
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,870
That's exactly what I was thinking.

285
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,630
You're mistaken.

286
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,320
Well then,

287
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,390
I'm going to get him supper.

288
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,200
Bye.

289
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Bye.

290
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,030
My noodles!

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
Gu Xun,

292
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
what are your plans for the new year?

293
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,960
What do you need?

294
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,240
Shall we go to Yunnan for a holiday?

295
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,670
It's rare to have so many days off.

296
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,790
We're all going together.

297
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,000
The more the merrier.

298
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
No.

299
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,080
Why not?

300
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,000

that Gu Xun has a girlfriend.

Could you be mistaken?

332
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,600

Yes.

And for this year,

356
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,240
we can bring our family along.

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,510
I'll be busy with my graduation then.

362
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,030
I won't be going.

363
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,270
How can you say that?

364
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,480

366
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,880
Jiang is a man

367
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,070
who is the most keen

368
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,200
on team-building activities.

369
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,830
If you draw his ire now,

370
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,920

you say you're busy with graduation,

374
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,790

375
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,830

If you use this excuse,

378
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,400
won't it be a stretch?

379
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,960
Let's go.

380
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,160
You have to go.

381
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,480
I just don't get you.

382
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
[Dough Twist]

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,920
You have the curves.

384
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,720
You have the beauty.

385
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,790
You have many admirers,
enough to go around the track 50 times.

386
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,000
No.

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,550
Fifty is an exaggeration.

388
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,960
Five is more likely.

389
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,440
Is Gu Xun different from them?

390
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,110
You don't get it.

391
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,920
Gu Xun

392
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,200
is just different.

393
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,270
Is this it?

394
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,000
Is it?

395
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,160
Where did the company assign us?

396
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,750
It must be this building.

397
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,790
What's with you?

398
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,960
Nothing.

399
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,640
But recently I've found you

400
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,070
to be brooding.

401
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,030
Matters of the heart?

402
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,480
There's nothing to be happy about.

403
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,750
Mr. Jiang,

404
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,200
I heard

405
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,750
that we can bring family members

406
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,400
to our company reunion, is that right?

407
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,640
Why didn't you bring your girlfriend?

408
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,720
Gu Xun as well.

409
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,590
Gu Xun doesn't have a girlfriend.

410
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,160
As for me,

411
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,550
my standards are too high.

412
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,830
I can't find anyone.

413
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,480
Doesn't he

414
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
have a girlfriend?

415
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
That's what I heard.

416
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,640
Who created that lie?

417
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,110
Gu Xun

418
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,880
had never dated before.

419
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,000
He has always been single.

420
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,070
Girlfriend?

421
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,960
He has none.

422
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,830
It's delicious.

423
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,790
No, wait.

424
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,480
I heard him say

425
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
that he's staying home
with his girlfriend for the new year.

426
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Girlfriend?

427
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,400
That's his usual trick to reject others.

428
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,830
I see him use it
at least ten times a year.

429
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,030
It's a critical strike

430
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,440
that ends all future attempts.

431
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,070
No one will ask him then.

432
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,240
Amazing.

433
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,750
Relax. He has none.

434
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,110
I see. He said that

435
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,550
to reject others.

436
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,550
Mr. Jiang,

437
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,070
have some more.

438
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,550
Thank you.

439
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,720
Eat more.

440
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,070
This one is delicious.

441
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,030
Have more of it.

442
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,550
Everyone, let's eat.

443
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,720
- Have more.
- Thank you.

444
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,510
Have some more.

445
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
Why are you happy that Gu Xun doesn't

446
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,830
have a girlfriend?

447
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm not.

448
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm having fun
at the company team-building event.

449
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,550
Having fun?

450
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,790
Why

451
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,480
is your face red?

452
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,510
Ignore me.

453
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,240
It's the heat.

454
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,790
I had a drink, okay?

455
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,350
It's the heat from the alcohol?

456
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Okay.

457
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
Later on,

458
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,880
at the masquerade ball,

459
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,310
what are you going as?

460
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,720
What is Gu Xun going as?

461
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,550
Come closer.

462
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,720
Golden mask.

463
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,500
[HC Game Masquerade Ball]

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,350
This man looks like Gu Xun.

465
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,160
Good evening, everyone.

466
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,350
Soon, we will

467
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,680
be playing some games.

468
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,240
The first game we'll be playing

469
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,270
for the night

470
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,720
is a variant of the game

471
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
Red Light, Green Light.

472
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,510
Everyone is wearing a mask today.

473
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,590
No one knows who the other is,

474
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,510
right?

475
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,640
The rules are simple.

476
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,750
It's almost the same
as the game we played as kids,

477
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,310
but today,

478
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,070
anyone who fails
to cross the finish line

479
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,960
within one minute

480
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,550
will be given

481
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,480
a very special "prize"

482
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,510
based on their outfit.

483
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,350
Is everyone ready?

484
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,400
Let's start.

485
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,160
One, two, three,

486
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,510
red light.

487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,750
Over here and here.

488
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,400
You're all out.

489
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,070
Okay. Let's go again.

490
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,720
One, two, three,

491
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
red light.

492
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,880
Over here and here.

493
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,160
Disqualified.

494
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,310
One, two, three,

495
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,960
red light.

496
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,350
This entire group here is out.

497
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,350
Okay. Let's go again.

498
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,550
One, two, three,

499
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,000
red light.

500
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,070
Time is up.

501
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,000
We now have a princess

502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,830
and a prince.

503
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,920
Shall we invite our prince and princess

504
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
to the stage?

505
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,590
We have one guy and one girl.

506
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
Tell me,

507
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,880
what punishment...

508
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,790
No. What reward should we give?

509
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,030
In that case, we'll have them

510
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,270
stare into each other's eyes
for 30 seconds. What do you think?

511
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,510
- Boo.
- Boo.

512
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:42,160
Kiss.

513
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,720
Why do I hear everyone calling
for a kiss?

514
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,200
Okay. Let's do that then.

515
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,110
Kiss.

516
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
We still don't know

517
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,070
who our prince and princess is.

518
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,030
How about this? Let's reveal them.

519
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,790
We will all

520
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,070
take off our masks too,

521
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,400
okay?

522
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,510
- Qianling?
- Qianling?

523
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,270
No. The golden mask?

524
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
It's you.

525
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
Mr. Gu.

526
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,070
Your mask is quite cool.

527
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,750
It fits your outfit.

528
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,200
I think it fits me too,

529
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,000
doesn't it?

530
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,830
You can wear it then.

531
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,070
Thank you.

532
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,750
Why is it you?

533
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,920
Shall we

534
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,240
begin the kiss?

535
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:14,590
Kiss.

536
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm a little shy.

537
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,920
Yes.

538
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,030
It's unfair to the girl.

539
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,720
Why don't we

540
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,270
do something else?

541
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,830
Okay.

542
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,400
Then,

543
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
we'll change it to the noses.

544
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Touch noses for 30 seconds, okay?

545
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,920
Everyone, shall we change it

546
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,680
to touching noses for 30 seconds?

547
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay.

548
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,960
Now let's say it together.

549
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,200
Touch noses.

550
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:57,160
Touch noses.

551
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,680
Let me do it.

552
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,110
What's going on?

553
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,400
I don't know.

554
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,590
Wow, Mr. Gu.

555
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,880
Mr. Gu, your way
of resolving the situation

556
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,310
is unique.

557
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Thank you.

558
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,790
No problem.

559
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,750
Let's thank our brave hero

560
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,070
along with our prince and princess.

561
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,270
What's with you?

562
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,310
Why are you so happy?

563
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,510
Let me show you

564
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,920
a secret weapon

565
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,640
that I have.

566
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,920
What is this?

567
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Let me tell you,

568
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,350
the other departments

569
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,070
have already
started their team gatherings.

570
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,310
Just look at what we're doing.

571
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,070
It's so boring.

572
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,160
I brought this along.

573
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,510
The hangover cure that works

574
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,720
even after a thousand drinks.

575
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,400
It's useless now.

576
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
Did you know
that everyone in the 9th Business Unit

577
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,960
is drunk now?

578
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,830
They're having so much fun.

579
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,200
What did you say?

580
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,680
The 9th Business Unit is drunk.

581
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,270
Does that mean Gu Xun is drunk as well?

582
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,110
Lend this to me.

583
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,550
I haven't even

584
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,920
had a single sip yet.

585
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,680
It's settled.

586
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
In this life,

587
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,750
we'll be the best of friends.

588
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,960
When it comes to alcohol,

589
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,400
you are my bro.

590
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
My tolerance level

591
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
is trash.

592
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,880
Who am I?

593
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,160
I can't drink at all.

594
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,110
- I...
- You're Gu, right? Gu.

595
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,750
We're good...

596
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,240
Right?

597
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,030
You...

598
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,750
- Are you okay?
- Qianling.

599
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,790
Yes, that's me.

600
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,830
You're Qianling.

601
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,720
The way you played...

602
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,920
My goodness.

603
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,510
Are you okay?

604
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's play together next time,

605
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,440
okay?

606
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,640
Okay.

607
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,790
I actually...

608
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,640
I actually...

609
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,680
I...

610
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,830
I like...

Yue Qianling,

630
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,750
you can't do it.

631
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,680
You can't, Yue Qianling.

632
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,030
You can't, Yue Qianling.

633
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,790
You can't be like this.

634
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,000
You can't be like this.

635
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,110
You can't.

636
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,400
You can't take advantage of him.

637
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,480
There's plenty of time.

638
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,830
You can do it in the future.

639
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,550
You can do it in the future.

640
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,240
What time is it?

641
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,400
It's 3:00 p.m., Gu Xun.

642
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,030
I never knew
you were such a heavy sleeper.

643
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,350
You were like a pig.

644
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,550
How did I get back?

645
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,310
Is there something going on

646
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,750
between you and Yue Qianling?

647
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,270
She brought you back last night.

648
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,720
Did you forget that?

649
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Open up.

650
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,720
No way. Why didn't you bring...

651
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,240
Take this.

652
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,920
What is it?

653
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,790
Take it.

654
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,830
Wait.

655
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,110
Why are you together?

656
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,790
Stop asking.

657
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,480
It's none of your business.

658
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,550
Take him.

659
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,480
Remember to make him drink that.

660
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
Remember.

661
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,830
Don't worry. I'll do it.

662
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,480
He must take that.

663
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,030
Don't forget.

664
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,680
No problem. Just go.

665
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,030
Take care of him.

666
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,960
No way.

667
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,510
How much did you drink?

668
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,070
If you don't drink...

669
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,920
Come on, Gu Xun. They're all gone.

670
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,880
We're the only ones left.

671
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
Hurry up.

672
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,270
Stop spacing out, okay?

673
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,750
Why don't I remember anything?

674
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,800
I'll give you this.

675
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,440
You let me win?

676
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,960
Are you selling the account?

677
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,920
What's going on?

678
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,960
You're in a good mood.

679
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,550
You can't ever understand
the heart of a young woman.

680
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,760
Are you in a good spirit

681
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,480
because you have good news

682
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,000
about you and that guy?

683
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,480
All I think is

684
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,880
that I have high hopes.

685
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,630
Are you close to him?

686
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,510
You can say that.

687
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,590
Let me ask you something.

688
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,440
If someone

689
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,360
is indifferent to you most of the time

690
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,480
but is very protective at key moments,

691
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,360
do you think

692
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,590
it means he likes you?

693
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,920
That's just the basic decency.

694
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,960
Perhaps he'll protect even a dog.

695
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,110
You don't get it.

696
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,920
This person

697
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
is usually quite cold

698
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and doesn't like to speak.

699
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,230
However...

700
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,710
Forget it.

701
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,880
If you like him, confess to him.

702
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,280
What's the point of telling me?

703
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Confess?

704
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,550
Go confess to him.

705
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,960
Otherwise, the crush
will never bear fruit.

706
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,000
Will you be happy with that?

707
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,590
Scared?

708
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,030
It's just one confession.

709
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,440
Is it that hard?

710
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,030
At most, you'll be harshly rejected.

711
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,150
Don't be scared.

712
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,360
It can be embarrassing,

713
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,000
but you won't know
until you've tried it.

714
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,280
At worst, you'll be eternal enemies,

715
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,710
never to contact each other again.

716
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
You're graduating soon.

717
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,480
Embody the impulsiveness of youths.

718
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,070
Don't leave room for regrets.

719
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,230
No way.

720
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,880
You're really scared?

721
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,760
Why would I be scared?

722
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,960
The youth of today

723
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,230
only seduce and tempt others.

724
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,480
Love confessions

725
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,400
are considered antiques
from centuries ago.

726
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,280
Further mathematics is also an antique
from centuries ago.

727
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,880
Do you understand it?

728
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,920
Shut up, you.

729
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,190
Who needs it anyway?

730
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I'm graduating.

731
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,360
I don't have the time.

732
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm the same.

733
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,150
How can I criticize her?

734
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,440
A confession...

735
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,440
Really?

736
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,280
You told Dough Twist

737
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,670
to confess to her crush?

738
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,630
Wait. What were you thinking?

739
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,710
Are you sacrificing her?

740
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,190
I'm using reverse psychology.

741
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,400
When it comes to Dough Twist,

742
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,400
don't be fooled
by her aggressive gameplay.

743
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,230
She's a coward when it comes to love.

744
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,880
The more I provoke her,

745
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,190
the more frightened she is.

746
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,630
I'm encouraging her on the surface,

747
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,440
but scaring her off in reality.

748
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
By now, she has likely thought

749
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
of 100 ways she could be rejected.

750
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,800
As long as she doesn't confess,

751
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,320
you'll still stand a chance.

752
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,190
Gu Xun,

753
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,710
when did you become this evil?

754
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,510
Graduation is tomorrow.
