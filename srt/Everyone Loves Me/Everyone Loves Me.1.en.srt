372
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,710
How could someone

373
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,960
have such a symmetrical
and perfect face?

374
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,880
I should
have been more merciful earlier.

375
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,080
With his skills,

376
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,790
does he really need you to hold back?

377
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,200
Symmetrical, huh?

378
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,670
You art majors like someone

379
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,230
for very weird reasons.

380
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,350
This is fate.

381
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,030
Maybe he's just into someone
like Qianling.

382
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,000
Really?

383
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,760
Look how excited you are.

384
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,150
Qianling,

385
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,320
I heard there's a new head

386
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,280
in the 9th Business Unit

387
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,760
who's also from Dongning University.

388
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,590
His name is Gu Xun. You know him?

389
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,030
I do.

390
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,280
Really?

391
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
But when I met him just now,

392
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,150
I asked if he knew you,

393
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,550
and he didn't say a word.

394
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,840
Seems like you two are not that close.

395
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,670
You know Jay Chou,

396
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,710
but does Jay Chou know you?

397
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,710
That's not the point.

398
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,150
You know him?

399
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,790
Of course I do.

400
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,520
But does he know you?

401
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,550
Well, I fell asleep to his songs

402
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,840
last night.

403
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,230
Let me introduce.

404
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,200
Gu Xun,

405
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
Jiang Junnan.

406
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,470
Starting today,

407
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,560
Gu Xun will head the 9th Business Unit,

408
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,160
focusing on AAA game development.

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,680
Gu Xun was handpicked by me,

410
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,760
and I have full confidence
in his abilities.

411
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,470
Last time, I suggested

412
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,400
dissolving the 9th Business Unit,

413
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
and the board agreed.

414
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,000
AAA game development

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,470
is crucial

416
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,680
for HC's future.

417
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
The board and I

418
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
have reached a consensus

419
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,310
on this matter.

420
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,920
As we all know,

421
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,040
in AAA game development,

422
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,430
engine development alone

423
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,430
takes

424
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,040
a minimum of three to five years.

425
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
Gu Xun,

426
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
have you considered

427
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,230
the timeline?

428
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,710
AAA titles require
high-definition graphics

429
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,760
and immense processing power.

430
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,830
Standard engines can't balance

431
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,110
graphics and optimization

432
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,760
at the same time.

433
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
However, engines upgraded by me

434
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,190
can significantly reduce
computational demand

435
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,160
and ensure smooth graphics.

436
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,350
In short,

437
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,000
we'll be able

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
to save on development time

439
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,800
right from the start.

440
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,520
Include "completion of a game
within three years"

441
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,680
in the contract then.

442
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I hope you can elaborate

443
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,830
on your project

444
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,350
at the project meeting next month.
Is that okay?

445
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,800
No problem.

446
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,920
Let me be clear up front.

447
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
At the project meeting,

448
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,830
if the approval rate

449
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,400
of your project doesn't exceed 50%,

450
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,230
you should resign.

451
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
Oh,

452
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,560
and Project Department 1's new title,

453
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,400
"The Love Broker,"

454
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,160
will also be up for approval next month.

455
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,640
We all know only one project

456
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,830
can pass at each project meeting.

457
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,920
As everyone knows, Mr. Jiang

458
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,110
is the best at getting approval.

459
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,000
If he's competing,

460
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,950
I'm afraid the rest of us
might not have much of a chance.

461
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,800
Looks like

462
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,310
I have no choice but to compete

463
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,310
with Mr. Jiang next month.

464
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,880
My apologies,

465
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
but the office space
of the 9th Business Unit

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,590
is being renovated now.

467
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,350
So,

468
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,760
we'll have to ask you

469
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,710
to make do with the warehouse

470
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,000
as the temporary office space.

471
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
That's okay.

472
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
But Mr. Wang,

473
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,040
given the limited space
in the warehouse,

474
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,430
I'd like to conduct

475
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,590
internal and external
recruitment simultaneously

476
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,160
to ensure that my department
is filled with the best.

477
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,680
No problem.

478
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,070
Yes, no problem.

479
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,830
Thank you all for your support then.

480
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,190
Thank you, directors.

481
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,110
Will I ever

482
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,470
have a chance with him?

483
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,400
Yishi,

484
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
I didn't expect to see you at HC too.

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,680
Looks like we have someone
to back us up now.

486
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,830
Don't try to cozy up to me.

487
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,800
I knew long ago that you guys
couldn't possibly produce a triple-A game.

488
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,470
What you said back there

489
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,800
was just a waste of time.

490
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,000
The meeting hasn't even started, Yishi.

491
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,880
Don't rush to a conclusion.

492
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,350
Giving you one month

493
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,160
is just delaying the inevitable.

494
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,950
Speaking of which, Gu Xun,

495
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,040
for someone aiming
to create a triple-A title,

496
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
how could you poach
from other departments?

497
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,710
Doesn't internal recruitment

498
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,590
ultimately depend
on the employee's own will?

499
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,520
The people I've hired

500
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
have been under my guidance for years.

501
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,430
You'd better keep your hands off them.

502
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,310
No way,

503
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,070
how is this any different
from a college office?

504
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,710
You can still back out if you want.

505
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,710
No way.

506
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,160
I've boarded your pirate ship.

507
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,520
How can I jump ship
before we've even set sail?

508
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,830
[The 9th Business Department]

509
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,400
New office space, new staff.

510
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,880
How about

511
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,190
a new name?

512
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,160
Everything should be changed,

513
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,590
but not the name.

514
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,560
From one to nine,

515
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,310
it's a cycle.

516
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,950
Nine

517
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,470
is both the beginning and the end.

518
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,710
We should stick
to our original aspiration.

519
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,110
I think the name is quite fitting.

520
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Why are you suddenly

521
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,040
so poetic?

522
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
It's gross.

523
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,560
Then let me be more practical.

524
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,680
In the following month,

525
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,350
we'll do our best
to get our project approved.

526
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,640
The most crucial part of a game proposal

527
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,040
is to define the core gameplay.

528
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,590
So we need to keep our team
as lean as possible.

529
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,920
Lead programmer,

530
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,040
lead designer, lead artist,

531
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,190
those are essential.

532
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,470
As for the other roles,

533
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,640
we'll see if we can find
suitable candidates.

534
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,350
If not,

535
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,590
we'll take on their job for now.

536
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,920
Hiring...

537
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,040
- Two, four, five...
- Right,

538
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
how much

539
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,760
do you plan to pay them?

540
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
The highest salary in the industry.

541
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,760
The highest?

542
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,590
How much

543
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,680
do you plan to pay me then?

544
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,640
How much do you want?

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,430
We're practically family,

546
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,000
so...

547
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,230
For now, we two don't have a salary.

548
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,470
But once the project gets approved

549
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,470
and we are officially onboard,

550
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,830
we will.

551
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,520
What?

552
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Why do they get paid and I don't?

553
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,880
If you want,

554
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,040
I can pay you out of my own pocket.

555
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,000
That's so kind of you.

556
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,350
The selfless Mr. Gu,

557
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,350
spending all the earnings
on development,

558
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,830
and even signing
