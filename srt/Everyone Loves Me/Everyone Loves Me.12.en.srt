No!

you're so knowledgeable.

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,830
Not really, I just

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,160

since I was a kid,

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,480
I'd always stayed quiet in the crowd,

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,790
hoping no one noticed me.

80
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,670

Based on the original fight pattern,

768
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,670
I'd like to add a new setting,

769
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,430
called Bullet Space.

770
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,120
When Lin Zhi or Ming Chen

771
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,000
faces a group of people,

772
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,280
as long as the mind point is full,

773
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,560
this space can be started.

774
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,600

There are three enemies.

775
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,430
When Lin Zhi

776
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,230
is focusing on one of the enemies,

777
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,910

781
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,120
This mode

782
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,360
showcases the player's finesse.

783
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,120
Players can constantly switch between

784
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,430
one-to-many and one-to-one

785
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,190
if they are good enough.

786
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,760

Bullet Space to do more with less.

789

For the art,

Yue Qianling has refined
Lin Zhi's weapons.

793

She added a whip form and a shield form.

Fan Xing also refined Ming Chen's model

795

by adding some details on the belt,

796
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,080

00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,520
look a little more polished.

798

in the EDGE Magazine,

829
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,000

about Stranded's character?

831
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,150
On the important characters' design,

832
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,520
they worked with top actors

833
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,710

in the plot.

836
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,630
Do you mean Lin Zhi should work
with celebrities too?

00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,760
Yeah!

838
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,560
I disagree.

Selling games with marketing tricks

840
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,080
cannot solve the problem.

841
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,230
Would you buy a game just

842
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,800
because the characters are celebrities?

843
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,800
Depends on who the person is.

844
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,710
If it's a good match for Lin Zhi,

845
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,430
it might work.
