00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,510
Thanks.

189
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,390
We've done some research.

190
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,260
This competition is not getting

191
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,510
a lot of attention.

192
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,790
That's why we're suggesting

193
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,630
we shoot more footage.

194
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,790
We'll give you a nice promo video

195
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,420
and a blooper reel.

196
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,510
What do you think?

197
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,670
Well,

198
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,630
I hope

199
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,180
we can work together.

200
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,220
♪Fate has propelled me forward,
My love burns bright and true♪

201
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:36,100
♪Every day after the pain,
I push beyond limits just for you♪

202
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,750
The effect

203
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,910
is similar to a martial arts movie,
right?

204
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,750
I almost

205
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,700
got in trouble this time,

206
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,260
but I'm glad it worked out.

207
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,110
But then again,

208
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,550
I didn't handle it right.

209
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,380
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,580
But I can assure you

211
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,190
it won't

212
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,940
happen again.

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,350
Really?

214
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,940
That means

215
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,260
you have to make a choice.

216
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,500
What's up?

217
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,820
I brought you
a door visual access control.

218
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,700
Put this on the door

219
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,230
and you can see what's going on outside.

220
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,310
Isn't that a cat's eye?

221
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,020
It's different.

222
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,990
This connects to your phone.

223
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,230
Whenever someone stays at your door

224
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,750
for more than ten seconds,

225
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,790
it alerts you on your phone.

226
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,260
Also,

227
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,750
if someone comes to your door again,

228
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,060
you'll know all about it.

229
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,820
What if I'm not home?

230
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,310
If you don't mind,

231
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,910
you can connect it to my phone, too.

232
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,990
That sounds

233
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,140
weird.

234
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,140
How so?

235
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,310
It's like a very sneaky tool.

236
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,870
Am I that creepy?

237
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,110
And this.

238
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,140
Water leakage alarm.

239
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,550
Whenever there's a leak for more than
3 seconds,

240
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,940
the alarm will trigger.

241
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,620
Oh, by the way...

242
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,460
And this.

243
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,620
For self-defense.

244
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,500
You should know how to use it.

245
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,910
That's so nice of you.

246
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,350
It's really touching.

247
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,260
You're so well prepared.

248
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,750
Brings back some very,

249
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,580
very touching memories.

250
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,580
What memories?

251
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,910
When I was in summer camp,

252
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,230
my grandma used

253
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,060
to shove things down my throat.

254
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,500
I think I had

255
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,820
this stick at the time.

256
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,790
- I also took it to...
- Stop reminiscing.

257
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,190
Go to sleep.

258
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,460
[Huang Jie]
Mr. Jiang won't be in tomorrow morning,

259
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,940
regular meeting has been moved
to the afternoon

260
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,620
to make sure everyone is here.

261
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,110
But,

262
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,910
I have a meeting

263
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,790
in the 9th Business Unit that afternoon.

264
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,500
I have to make a choice.

265
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,990
Going.

266
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,380
Not going.

267
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,940
Going. Not going.

268
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,110
Should I go?

269
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,380
Should I go?

270
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,230
Xinyi,

271
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,020
did Mr. Jiang lose track of time?

272
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,460
It's probably the investment client

273
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,550
having opinions on the deal.

274
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,990
So Mr. Jiang is in a bind.

275
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,940
Don't worry.

276
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,700
I'll see what's going on.

277
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,380
Please wait for a bit.

278
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,430
That guy's so cool,

279
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,620
so brave to save her.

280
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,020
If I'm bullied,

281
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,550
will you come to save me?

282
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,820
That's for sure.

283
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,700
You're my girlfriend.

284
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,870
If I don't protect you, who will?

285
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,060
I'll definitely save you.

286
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,430
You're so nice.

287
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,020
You must treat me well like this
forever.

288
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,820
That's for sure.

289
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,670
I will always treat you well.

290
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,910
Mr. Jiang,

291
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,750
the meeting.

292
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,990
Jiang Junnan,

293
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,260
what are you doing?

294
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,910
I'm watching the movie.

295
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,700
Focus on watching.

296
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,430
Look

297
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,550
at that poor guy.

298
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,230
Yeah.

299
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,670
Because he has
to protect his girlfriend.

300
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,350
I was right.

301
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,140
It's going very slow over there.

302
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
But Mr. Jiang said

303
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,380
not to wait for him.

304
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,110
We can start the meeting first,

305
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,550
he'll be here as soon as he's done.

306
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,750
All right, let's talk first.

307
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,910
I'd like to talk to you

308
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,020
about the chapter
of the first encounter at the inn.

309
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,870
Aren't there a couple of subplots?

310
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,910
Ruru,

311
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,380
my time is up.

312
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,700
I've got a meeting.

313
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,820
You promised to watch a movie
with me today.

314
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,020
Optimize them into vegetation.

315
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,460
- Yeah, it's very romantic.
- The scene would be better.

316
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,110
Yeah.

317
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,020
Mr. Jiang, the deal is done?

318
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,500
We were just discussing

319
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,910
those three subplots.

320
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,790
I've got it all organized.

321
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,910
Why don't you take a look

322
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,230
and see which one fits,

323
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,670
and we will discuss it then.

324
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,580
Thanks.

325
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,310
I don't know what I'd do without you.

326
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,260
Sorry, guys.

327
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,790
Project Department 1,
pays well with less job load.

328
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,190
Just got promoted and trusted by
the management.

329
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,350
The downside

330
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,580
is the lack of innovation.

331
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,750
The 9th Business Unit
is arduous and tiring,

332
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,140
and has no money.

333
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,430
The advantage?

334
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,430
I can achieve my dream.

335
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,670
Oh, Yue Qianling.

336
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,190
What did you want when you decided
to make games?

337
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,350
Yes,

338
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,910
it was for Gu Xun at first

339
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,460
that I learned about Triple-A games.

340
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,060
But I have to do it for myself now.

341
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,550
But,

342
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,460
if I really go to the 9th Business Unit.

343
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,110
That's just asking for trouble,
isn't it?

344
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,820
Triple-A games are going to crush me.

345
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,500
Then let's decide it

346
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
by flipping a coin.

347
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,580
Heads yes, tails no.

348
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,060
Boss.

349
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,350
You've been talking to yourself
for a while.

350
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,260
Why did you

351
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,260
need to flip a coin?

352
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,460
Because

353
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,870
of the department transfer?

354
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,460
How did you know?

355
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,620
When you finished Lin Zhi's drawing,

356
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,260
I talked to Gu Xun

357
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,140
about transferring you there.

358
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,670
But he declined.

359
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,580
Said he didn't want to interfere
too much.

360
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
He wants you to make your own decisions.

361
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,430
So, have you made a decision yet?

362
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,350
I don't know.

363
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,110
That's why I flipped the coin.

364
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
I think

365
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,820
you had your answer

366
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,940
the moment you flipped the coin.

367
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm sure you'll face more difficulties

368
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,700
when you join the 9th Business Unit.

369
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,230
Lin Zhi is only a small part of it,

370
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,190
but at the same time, what you gain

371
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,500
will be even more valuable.

372
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,110
That's something I'm sure
you've experienced.

373
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Boss,

374
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,580
may I ask you a question?

375
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,700
Why did you create
the 9th Business Unit?

376
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,060
I had as much trouble

377
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,820
making up my mind as you did.

378
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,060
So, I flipped a coin as well.

379
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,380
Then,

380
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,670
what's the outcome?

381
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,990
The result is don't do it.

382
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,790
But it's because of this result

383
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,230
it strengthens my will to do it.

384
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,110
Because at that moment,

385
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,910
I suddenly realized

386
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,910
what my heart wanted most.

387
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,190
So, the most important thing

388
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,460
about flipping a coin isn't the result,

389
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,380
it's

390
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,620
that you follow your heart.

391
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,340
Got it.

392
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,710
Thanks.

393
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,100
I'll definitely do my part

394
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
for Hero's Path.

395
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,710
Do your best.
I believe in Gu Xun's choice.

396
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,220
My first job

397
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,980
was in the Project Department 1.

398
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,020
It was like a teacher to me.

399
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,620
And,

400
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,500
I did learn a lot here.

401
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,260
Stop.

402
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
I don't agree with you going
to the 9th Business Unit.

403
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
First,

404
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,020
you're perfect for the position

405
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,070
and you're doing a great job.

406
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,070
Moreover,

407
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,190
you just got promoted.

408
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,430
Who'll take over when you're gone?

409
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,340
You want to leave the project
halfway done?

410
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,550
Mr. Jiang,

411
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,620
I'm grateful for your promotion.

412
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,550
I've done my best in every job

413
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,430
in Project Department 1.

414
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,430
I can do

415
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,670
without all the performance bonuses.

416
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,500
I can also guarantee a good handover.

417
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,710
I'll leave when everyone

418
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,590
gets used to working without me.

419
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,470
There's no way I'm letting you go.

420
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,550
Get to work.

421
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,860
Alright.

422
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,380
I really think

423
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,190
you'd better not get tough with Jiang.

424
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,670
- I'll have a chicken cutlet, please.
- Okay.

425
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,740
Think about it.
If you leave and anger him,

426
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,500
how can you continue in the company?

427
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,190
There are ways to make you feel bad.

428
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,950
But I really want to go
to the 9th Business Unit.

429

430
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,470
Good news!

431
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,710
Yue Qianling chose us.

432
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,340
The bad news is
that Jiang Yishi won't let her go, right?

433
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,380
You really are the boss here.

434
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,340
Nothing gets past you.

435
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,950
Then should we help her?

436
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,620

She has to know sooner or later.

456
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,980
I'll see about that.

Hello,

461
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,950
do you have time for an offline gathering
of the illustrator circle?

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,500

to try to get him on it.

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:44,910
Goodbye.

563
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,190
Drink more.

564
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,190
It's better than whatever you buy.

565
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,430
Why are you here?

566
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,670
Does he want a hug?

567
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,620
The progress bar goes straight up.

568
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
What's on your mind?

569
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,430
Isn't that heavy?

570
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,830
Work badge.

571
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,310
Thanks.

572
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,580
[ID Card Department: the 9th Business Unit,
Name: Yue Qianling]

573
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,470
Hello, Mr. Gu.

574
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,380
- Hello, Mr. Gu.
- Hello, Qianling

575
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,220
Hello.

576
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,670
Qianling...

577
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,710
Happy induction, Qianling.

578
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,380
Thanks.

579
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,260
The flowers.

580
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,590
I chose the flowers carefully.

581
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,500
Isn't it pretty?

582
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Yes, it is. Thanks.

583
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,830
And this poster.

584
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,620
I spent the night picking it up.

585
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,500
Doesn't this picture look cute?

586
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
Yeah.

587
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,070
Pretty cute.

588
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,790
Isn't that right?

589
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,070
I spent the whole night on this.

590
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,950
Thanks.

591
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,950
I'm glad you like it.

592
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,590
Su Zheng!

593
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,430
Su Zheng's standards

594
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,910
are unique.

595
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,220
Do you like it?

596
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,380
Then,

597
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,980
you haven't forgotten

598
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,140
our bets right?

599
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,260
Are you kidding?

600
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,380
Am I the kind who doesn't honor a bet?

601
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,070
Say it.

602
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,340
I want you to go somewhere with me.

603
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,140
I'll set the time and place.

604
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,070
It's not a date, is it?

605
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,710
A date it is then, I'm not scared.

606
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,430
Alright.

607
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,910
[Exhibition]
10 days to go

608
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,840
before the biggest Games Expo
in Jiangcheng this year.

609
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,650
In addition to demonstrating strength,

610
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,260
it is also an opportunity

611
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,380
to attract investors.

612
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,740
This time the company got
the center booth

613
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,550
and the main screen.

614
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,190
It'll be

615
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,310
handed over to one of the departments.

616
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,190
Then let Mr. Jiang and Mr. Gu
fight it out.

617
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,260
We're all

618
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,470
pretty self-aware. Right?

619
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,790
Yeah.

620
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,430
The Love Broker and Hero's Path

621
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,590
are the most clamored for
at the Games Expo.

622
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,260
Yes.

623
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,430
The 9th Business Unit

624
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,740
will be releasing a promo

625
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,070
for Hero's Path.

626
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,550
Project Department 1 is ready to open

627
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,860
The Love Broker for alpha test.

628
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,710
We'll find out soon.

629
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,070
Well,

630
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,590
we'll give it to whichever one of you

631
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,260
that gets a better response.

632
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,550
Have you seen the promo video?

633
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,710
Any thoughts?

634
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,740
I was just going to talk to you.

635
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,140
The characters, battle mode,
and atmosphere

636
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
are pretty good.

637
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,710
The easter eggs are also interesting.

638
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,670
In conclusion,

639
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,620
excellent.

640
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,260
But I feel like something's missing.

641
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,340
I know you're a perfectionist,

642
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,140
but you're really overthinking it.

643
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,430
It's already excellent.

644
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,430
Since when do you like flower arranging?

645
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,710
These were Qianling's gifts.

646
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,710
Su Zheng got other department's
attention

647
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,590
when making the banner.

648
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,830
Saying we got a beauty in.

649
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,260
She's got too many she doesn't know
what to do with them.

650
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,020
So, she gave it

651
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,220
to everyone.

652
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,670
Wait.

653
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,070
If she doesn't know what to do with it,

654
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,550
why didn't she decline them?

655
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,910
It was shoved into her hands.

656
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,020
Oh yeah.

657
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,260
What's the plan for Yue Qianling

658
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,220
in our team?

659
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,020
I plan to...

660
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,740
I think

661
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,430
you've been meddling too much.

662
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,740
As a friend,
I really want to advise you.

663
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,950
You gotta take action to get a girl.

664
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,860
Action proves everything.

665
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,910
Look at Su Zheng's banner,

666
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,470
and look at these flowers.

667
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,100
It's all about feelings.

668
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,310
You know that?

669
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,790
You have no clue.

670
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,950
Shut up.

671
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,140
I've got a few left.

672
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,670
Take action.

673
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,980
She gave it to you, you gave it to me,

674
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,500
and you want me to give it to her?

675
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,550
You're nuts.

676
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,070
Wait.

677
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,830
You're cursing at me?

678
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,310
It was fine before I took out the trash.

679
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,740
No way.

680
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,470
Hello?

681
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,550
Madam landlord?

682
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,910
The lock is broken.

683
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,220
If the lock is broken,

684
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,190
you should call a repair company.

685
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,620
Why did you call me in the middle
of the night?

686
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,020

Are you home?

697
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,950
I'm in my hometown.

698
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,070
My sister is having a wedding tomorrow.

699
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,020
What's up?

700
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,380
Oh, nothing.

701
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

702
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,710
What's wrong?

703
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,380
Uhm...

704
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,260
I think my lock is broken.

705
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,260
Broken?

706
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,590
I think the battery's dead.

707
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,500
I was going to stay at a hotel.

708
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
But my identification card was in there.

709
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,100
Let's go to my place first.

710
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,860
Wear these.

711
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,100
Girls' slippers?

712
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,790
I like to wear a bigger size.

713
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,590
Thanks.

714
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,860
There are matching mugs.

715
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,140
Matching pillows too?

716
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,820
Do you usually live alone?

717
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,620
Have you ever seen anyone other
than Jiang Junnan come to my house?

718
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,030
It's getting late.

719
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,100
Let me

720
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,910
use the restroom.

721
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,300
That way.

722
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,430
I got new sheets and a comforter.

723
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,270
Want to watch a movie?

724
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,710
What movie?

725
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,950
Horror film.

726
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,430
Come on.

727
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,540
What are you doing?

728
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,910
I'm a little tired.

729
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,140
I want to lean for a while.

730
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,340
What are you doing?

731
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,910
The sound is too low.

732
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,910
Yeah.

733
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,580
I think the sound is low too.

734
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,140
Scooch over.

735
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,190
It's fine.

736
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,190
I'm not scared.

737
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Uhm...

738
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm scared.

739
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,300
What's there to be scared of?

740
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,470
Did you

741
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,030
hear something?

742
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,300
A noise.

743
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,100
It's like,

744
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,380
the sound

745
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
of crunching.

746
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,990
It sounds

747
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,270
very,

748
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,430
very close.

749
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,990
It's like it's in my ear.

750
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,230
You want one?

751
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,990
Does your couch

752
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,270
have a massage feature?

753
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,580
Massage feature?

754
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,380
Help!

755
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,820
The curtains.

756
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,860
It's too late. I'm not watching.

757
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,060
I'm going to bed.

758
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,670
[Su Zheng's calling]

759
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,510
Su Zheng? It's him again?

760
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,950
Hello?

761
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,860
Is this Qianling's number?

762
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,510
I'm Gu Xun.

763
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,580
Qianling went to sleep.

764
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,190
Aren't you still just friends?

765
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,230
Almost a couple.

766
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,750
You're awake?

767
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,540
Let's eat.

768
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,060
We'll go to the office together.

769
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,620
What a feast!

770
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,100
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

771
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,430
What's this?

772
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,710
How do you know my size?

773
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,060
It's not like you wear special sizes.

774
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,380
I can tell at a glance.

775
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:49,540
I, uhm...

776
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,510
Thirsty?

777
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,540
Have some water.

778
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,860
I don't want this mug. It's ugly.

779
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,780
Get another one.

780
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,060
You think it's ugly, too?

781
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,230
Too?

782
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,300
Jiang Junnan gave this to Feng Ruru.

783
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,820
She said it's ugly, so here it is.

784
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,190
Said she didn't want
to see this pair of failed gifts.

785
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,100
What about those female slippers
by the door?

786
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,750
I bought it for you.

787
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,710
Thought you'd wear it
when you come to my house.

788
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,340
What about the pillows on the couch?

789
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,580
They are Jiang Junnan's pillows.

790
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,990
The two pillows in the room
are also Jiang Junnan's?

791
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,910
No more questions?

792
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,190
Jiang Junnan won't happen

793
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,620
to prepare the breakfast, right?

794
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,910
What do you think?

795
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,060
I think

796
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,950
it looks similar.

797
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,190
To what?

798
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,030
To...

799
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,230
What Jiang Junnan would make.

800
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,670
Dummy.

801
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Pudding!

802
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,670
Time to eat.

803
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,470
Come.

804
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,990
Come on.

805
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,910
I'll do it.

806
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,620
Hello?

807
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,470
Where did you stay last night?

808
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,860
Are you still okay?

809
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,670
I stayed in my neighbor's house.

810
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,230
The neighbor on the opposite?

811
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,580
Oh, I get it now.

812
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,030
It's not what you think.

813
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,950
You don't have to explain. I understand.

814
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,820
Gu Xun is usually so cold.

815
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,190
He let you stay in his place,

816
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,430
chauffeured you around,

817
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,860
and even caught bad guys for you.

818
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,580
He definitely likes you.

819
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,230
I'm hanging up. Bye.

820
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,580
Let's go.

821
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,190
Good morning, Qianling.

822
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,670
Morning.

823
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,580
Morning.

824
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,190
It's not big enough. And the color

825
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,340
might need to change.

826
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Make it a little lighter?

827
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,860
Yeah. Tell the manufacturers

828
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,190
to make a new version.

829
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,140
Okay. I'll just

830
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,910
organize this a little bit and
give it to them.

831
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,100
I'll look at the others.

832
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,380
I think the hairpiece is
not good enough too.

833
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,860
Yeah, look at this.

834
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,230
Overall this is not bad.

835
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,950
Look at the next one.

836
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,910
Overall,
it has oriental elements as well.

837
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:22,380
Gu Xun is usually so cold.

838
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,750
He let you stay in his place,

839
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,990
chauffeured you around,

840
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,860
and even caught bad guys for you.

841
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,430
He definitely likes you.

842
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,430
Qianling.

843
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:39,860
Xinyi, you're here too.

844
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
Here, take a look.

845
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,820
This is so cute.

846
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,910
And it's funny too, isn't it?

847
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,430
I wonder if we could make

848
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,300
our weapons like this.

849
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,780
Wouldn't it be awesome?

850
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,580
Let's discuss this
in the conference room.

851
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,190
- Okay.
- Let's go.

852
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,620
Xinyi, let's go discuss it.

853
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,300
Okay.

854
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,990
What are you looking at?

855
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,060
Nothing.

856
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,620
Better let them tweak the poster.

857
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,580
Get to work.

858
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,820
I'll show you when it's done.

859
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:22,580
[The 9th Business Unit, Producer]

860
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,380
Isn't that a bold idea?

861
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,300
It's similar to what was said before.

862
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,030
Then it's settled.

863
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,030
- Alright.
- Alright.

864
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,910
What were you talking about
with Su Zheng

865
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,030
and laughed like that?

866
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,030
Su Zheng told me

867
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,670
about the humanoid sign at the show.

868
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,990
I think it's pretty useful.

869
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,780
