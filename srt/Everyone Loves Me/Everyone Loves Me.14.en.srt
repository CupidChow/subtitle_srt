to thank Mr. Gu

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,030

103

104
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,950
there's no way
I'd work in Triple-A games.

105
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,390
I'd like to thank you all.

106
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,860
Without your help,

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,910
I wouldn't have been able to fulfill
my dream of working in Triple-A games.

108

109

- Alright!

- Cheers! Keep it up!
- Cheers!

117
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,070

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,980
That's right, Qianling.

131
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,030
Why don't you just come over?

132
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,100
It'd be great.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,710
Yeah!

134
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,630
You're so good.

135
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,630
We've seen what you can do.

136
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,860
Let's be together.

137
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,470

You're partying with another department.

It's time off work

149
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,180
and you're still being so strict, huh?

150
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,950
I discipline my own staff.

151
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,910
Is it any of your business?

152
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,910
Your own staff?

153
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,270
Who're you talking about?

154
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,470
Mr. Jiang.

155
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,390
Mr. Gu must be a good teacher.

156
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,540
Why else would my staff shine

157
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,340
when they come to you?

158
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Leaders who can't manage

159
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,740
have this concern.

160
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,350
Mr. Gu is so brave.

161
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,780
This is the first time
I've seen him like this.

162
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,910
That's because he's drunk.

163
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,180
His skill for sharp words increased.

164
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,150
Don't let it get to you.

165
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,150
They've always been like this.

166
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,270
Why?

167
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,350
That year, Jiang Yishi was
a third-year graduate student

168
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,990
and the student council president.

169
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,420
Gu Xun and I were sophomores.

170
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
At a school game innovation contest,

171
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,630
Jiang Yishi saw Gu Xun's ability

172
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
at first glance.

173
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,180
They loved the versus mode you designed.

174
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,420
Our program passed.

175
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,990
- Really?
- Really!

176
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,060
That's great!

177
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,460
Jiang Yishi often took Gu Xun

178
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,510
on small projects for companies.

179
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,350
Gu Xun was bold and innovative
in the early stage,

180
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,540
while Jiang Yishi followed up
with a steady push.

181
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
They partnered up for many projects.

182
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,060
They agreed with each other's talent

183
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,580
and only talent alone.

184
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,230
Even they preferred Zongzi
of vastly different flavor.

185
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,510
They also supported different teams,

186
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,060
that just like their personalities,

187
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,540
were the complete opposite.

188
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,630
In short,

189
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,910
they're not for each other.

190
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,580
It'll come

191
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,110
crashing down over time.

192
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,750
I remember the day of Jiang Yishi's
graduation

193
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,460
was a beautiful day.

194
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,510
No, guys!

195
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,110
You're just splitting up for now.

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,630
The circle is so small.

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,060
We'll sure meet again.

198
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,180
I'll take the computer.

199
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,820
Payware is mine.

200
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,660
No, stop.

201
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,820
Tell him

202
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,990
I went to all this trouble

203
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,990
to get him to be a lead programmer,

204
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,150
and he just pushed it off.

205
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,030
What does that mean?

206
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,390
Yeah, Xun.

207
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,390
I heard him.

208
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,630
You tell him,

209
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,060
he wants to make money off the game,

210
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,230
but I want to grow.

211
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,780
I can't afford two years.

212
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Senior, he...

213
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,940
I heard him.

214
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,390
You tell him,

215
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,940
he's a college kid
making Triple-A games.

216
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,150
Who's investing in him?

217
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,060
Who's investing in you?

218
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,300
You don't know until you try.

219
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,390
Try?

220
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,820
It's impossible.

221
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,060
Senior.

222
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,580
Wait.

223
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,230
There's nothing good about Jiang.

224
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,660
Wait.

225
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,580
What?

226
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,870
My name is Jiang too.

227
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,150
I'll tell you what.

228
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,870
At the bar in the back of the school,

229
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,390
they tied for first place in darts.

230
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,270
Tied?

231
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,420
I alone was No.1.

232
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,940
Talking big, huh?

233
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,910
Let's do it?

234
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,390
Bring it on.

235
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,270
Gu Xun, you're winning!

236
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,510
Who said that?

237
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,820
Not me.

238
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,700
You?

239
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,780
No! Not me.

240
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,460
You said that didn't you?

241
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,230
Hey, Jiang!

242
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,390
If you're not good enough,

243
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,390
don't take it out on my staff.

244
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,150
Who's not good enough?

245
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,660
You, of course.

246
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,540
Get this straight.

247
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,350
You're not good enough,

248
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,820
And you're good enough?

249
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,540
Don't fight!

250
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,990
Don't fight!

251
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,870
Slow down. There are steps.

252
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,420
Take it easy.

253
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,630
It's fine. I'm not drunk.

254
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,870
I know.

255
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,030
- Take it easy.
- I'm not drunk.

256
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,580
Careful!

257
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,030
Careful!

258
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,940
Are you okay?

259
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,420
Where's my phone?

260
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,270
What for?

261
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,990
I want to call Feng Ruru.

262
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,150
Phone!

263
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,850
Where are you, my dear phone?

264
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,750
It's over here.

265
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,270
Oh, so that's where you are.

266
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,460
I was looking for you.

267
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm calling.

268
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,350
What's the first thing I should say?

269
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,780
[Jiang Junnan]

270
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,540
You're calling me.

271
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,030
Don't say a word.

272
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,700
No, you're calling...

273
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,940
What's the first thing I should say?

274
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,290
If it were me,

275
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,780
I might, uh, might want to...

276
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,230
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,910
I know what to say.

278
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,700
Why isn't she taking my calls?

279
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,350
Why?

280
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,910
Is she asleep?

281
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,910
Hello?

282
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,780
I'm sorry,

283
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,540
for calling you this late.

284
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,660
- I'm...
- Careful!

285
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm Jiang Junnan.

286
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,300
We

287
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,580
played the Outdoor Real-Life CS
together today.

288
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,150
When I first saw you,

289
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,750
I remembered a song.

290
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,030
♪I love you, my dear girl♪

291
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,870
I forgot the others.

292
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,700
I think you're kind of special.

293
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,460
Can I be your friend?

294
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Can I be your friend?

295
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,540
Hello?

296
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,230
Do you hate me?

297
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,180
Do you hate me?

298
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,420
No, I don't.

299
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,460
If you don't hate me,

300
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,420
can I be your friend?

301
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,060
Yes.

302
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,820
Great!

303
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,390
It's getting late,

304
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,460
I'll call you tomorrow.

305
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,780
You go to bed earlier.

306
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,180
Yes!

307
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,820
She wants to be my friend.

308
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,350
Careful!

309
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,150
We're friends now.

310
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,820
Hey, Jiang!

311
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,660
No...

312
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
That's enough.

313
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,630
You won. So stop looking.

314
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,300
Say, he's good or I'm good?

315
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,390
You are.

316
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,780
You're the best.

317
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,270
Come on.

318
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,990
It's here.

319
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,180
Stop! That's not it!

320
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,630
Car key...

321
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,910
Get the car keys for me.

322
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,390
Stop moving.

323
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,540
Give me the car key.

324
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,660
Car key!

325
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,700
Car key.

326
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,540
Why are you touching me?

327
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,580
Do you think I want to touch you?

328
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,270
Come here.

329
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,230
Be obedient.

330
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,910
I'm looking for keys.

331
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,270
Now, where are the keys?

332
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,030
Gu Xun, let's go.

333
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,510
Here.

334
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,180

353
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,110

354
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,110
Really?

tomorrow.

359
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,220
Is that okay?

360
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,740
Why should I give you?

361
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,070
Is he sobered up?

362
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,790
Shouldn't it be our joint property?

363
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,460
Men,

364
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,500
no matter how much they drink,

365
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,550
won't act well afterward.

366
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,940
Our next task

367
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,870
is to complete the promotional video
for Hero's Path.

368
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,870
We can talk about our ideas in terms

369
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,350
of structure, style, and content.

370
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,070
In addition to style and flair,

371
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,830
we have to set the hook

372
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,110
and whet the player's appetite.

373
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,390
Actually, for this kind of teaser,

374
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,420
we could add some easter eggs

375
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,980
to let players explore on their own.

376
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,260
If that's the case,

377
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,390
the art team has

378
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,500
some prototypes
to finalize character art

379
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,260
that players might be interested in.

380
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,350
We could also include footage

381
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,980
of us making the promo

382
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,830
to make it more engaging.

383
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,110
Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

384

Contrasting personality,

385
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,590
and nobility,

complement one another and coexist.

387
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,700
What should I do?

388
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,390
I have to speak later. I'm so nervous.

389
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,550
There's no reason to be nervous.

390
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,940
We'll have a meeting later,

391
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,590
but it's all old coworkers.

392
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,660
Try your best!

393
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,180
By the way,

394
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,630
I've heard that today's meeting

395
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,790
might announce The Love Broker's

396
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,260
group leader.

397
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,180
I heard that Yin Jun has been
preparing for it

398
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,180
for over a month.

399
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,260
Isn't he already

400
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Miracle Kid's group leader?

401
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,660
It's a transfer.

402
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,590
Everyone wants to go higher.

403
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,630
Miracle Kid is running stable already.

404
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,740
That program bonus is definitely

405
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,980
less than The Love Broker.

406
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,390
I'm sure he wants more.

407
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,980
It's up to Mr. Jiang to decide.

408
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,020
Fine.

409
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,910
Then let's all come up
with a plan first.

410
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,940
Thank you all.

411
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,150
Hold on.

412
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,110
I have another

413
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,910
very important announcement to make.

414
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,020
Mr. Gu said

415
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,660
that in addition to daily bonuses,

416
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
each department selects a top employee

417
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,870
for additional performance incentives.

418
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,220
- Thanks, Mr. Gu.
- Thanks, Mr. Gu.

419
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,630
Fan Xing,

420
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,310
we'll recommend you for the art team.

421
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,500
Mr. Wei,

422
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,590
I might have to reject it.

423
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,220
It should be Qianling.

424
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,870
If not for her Lin Zhi,

425
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,180
Project Department 1

426
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,310
would be celebrating now.

427
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,740
I've asked Mr. Gu.

428
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,220
She doesn't belong to our department.

429
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,590
It can't go through the process.

430
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,180
Well, we can't let her work for nothing.

431
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,980
[The Love Broker, Cute Pet Project]
For example, I designed the characters,

432
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
not only to ground the characters
given by the planning team

433
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,020
but also to dig deeper into the
character's background and heart.

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Finally,

435
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,700
I'd like to talk a little bit
outside of my expertise.

436
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,790
This time, the best thing I learned

437
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,070
in my part-time job is

438
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,700
to not limit yourself.

439
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
If you don't push yourself,

440
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,310
you'll never know your capability.

441
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,980
But if you do push yourself,

442
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,460
you'll realize that you have
more potential

443
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,590
than you ever thought.

444
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,870
Because I didn't set limits for myself,

445
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,500

447
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,310
I got creative.

448
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,940
In everyone's mind,

449
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,260
[Cute Pet Project]
there's always a dog

450
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,020
beside the aristocratic
male protagonist.

451
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
And for the dogs, they're usually
famous dogs

452
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,420
such as American Pit Bulls and Beagles.

453
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,110
But this time,

454
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,390
I designed a stray rural dog

455
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,350
[Male's Protagonist's Pet]
for the male protagonist.

456
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,910
Stray rural dog?

457
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,420
It shows the kindness and patience

458
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,660
of the male protagonist.

459
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,740
I think

460
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,700
it would also add to the gameplay that
he teaches players

461
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,020
how to tame stray dogs of some sort

462
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,660
which could add some more interaction.

463
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,220
In addition to the one I described,

464
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
other pampering personalities

465
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,660

and the male protagonist

468
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,420
complement each other.

469
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,310
For example, the male protagonist

personalities.

474

Yue Qianling was able

to juggle the key animation
of both departments

479
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,500
so nicely.

in such a short period.

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,550

An immortal is scared of a roach?

532
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,980
I do.

- You're so professional.

- Is this okay?
- Yes.

mopped the floor,

and even gave me a massage.

559

Sit down now.

Quickly, take a seat.

I'm sorry to keep you busy all morning.

566
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,460
- It's fine.
- Come.

567
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,500
Have a taste.

568
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,790
This is my homemade bean curd.

569
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,790
Try it and see if it's good.

570
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,550
Don't take too much.

571
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,550
It's too salty.

572
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,700
How is it?

573
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,660
It tastes exactly like what I had

574
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,790
when I was a kid.

575
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,500
That's how my mom did.

576
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,070
That's great if you like it.

577
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,910
There's another can over there.

578
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,870
Take it if you want.

579
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,180
Thanks, Auntie!

580
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,350
You're welcome.

581
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,350
Come, eat!

582
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,070
Eat more, Qianling.

583
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,180
Eat some fried dough sticks,
porridge is not filling.

584
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,550
Seeing you young people together

585
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,590
reminds me of when I was young

586
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,260
and her dad was going for me.

587
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,590
Her dad was just like you

588
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,220
and delivered breakfast to me.

589
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,260
Did the laundry,

590
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,500
did some chores,

591
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,260
and massage for me.

592
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,310
You know what?

593
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,790
His dad was the school hunk

594
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,700
for Xicheng First Middle.

595
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,630
He had a lot of admirers.
Do you know that?

596
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,910
Auntie,

597
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,070
were you from Xicheng First Middle?

598
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,790
Yeah.

599
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,910
My mom too!

600
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,310
Your mom was from Xicheng First Middle?

601
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,910
Yeah.

602
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,110
What's her name?

603
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,310
Her name is Gu Yunping.

604
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,590
Is her name Gu Yunping?

605
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,180
Yeah.

606
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,310
Are you her son?

607
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,220
Yeah.

608
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,660
Did you know?

609
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,260
We were classmates!

610
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,260
What a coincidence!

611
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,590
Such a coincidence!

612
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,630
Your mom and I were classmates,

613
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,310
and you live with my daughter too.

614
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,790
Such a fate!

615
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
Mom!

616
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,500
Calm down.

617
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,220
We live opposite each other.

618
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,790
Well, it's almost the same anyway.

619
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,910
That's a generalization.

620
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,020
You know that?

621
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,070
Leader,

622
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,980
she'll be in your hands from now on.

623
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,180
Please take good care of her.

624
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,590
She's a sloppy kid.

625
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,460
Mom!

626
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,550
Auntie,

627
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,590
of course, I would.

628
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,460
Good.

629
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
Also, did you know?

630
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,150
I came here to observe

631
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,500
this neighborhood.

632
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,740
It's not very secure.

633
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,700
You see...

634
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,420
There are so many people

635
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,740
coming in and out.

636
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,790
You know that security guard

637
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,660
was playing with his phone.

638
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,460
Auntie,

639
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,700
don't worry.

640
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,630
I'll bring her home myself

641
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,980
if she's back home from work late.

642
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,310
That's great!

643
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,910
Oh,

644
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,180
not just sending her back,

645
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,220
you can also stay

646
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,910
for a meal.

647
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,980
Yes, I can cook.

648
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,940
Then we'll have dinner every night.

649
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,180
Every night?

650
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,940
Once every two days is fine too.

651
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,550
But Auntie,

652
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,150
Qianling

653
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,220
likes spicy food.

654
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,910
It's not good for the stomach.

655
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,220
Chili peppers detoxify moisture.

656
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,260
Mom!

657
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,310
I told you,

658
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,390
foot bath also drains dampness.

659
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,110
Why didn't you listen?

660
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,870
I told you

661
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,220
not to read those public articles.

662
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,390
They are all fraud.

663
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,870
Eat your breakfast!

664
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,020
You eat, too.

665
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,940
Oh, yeah.

666
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,940
Leader,

667
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,420
leave me your number.

668
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,980
Alright, Auntie.

669
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,940
If anything happens to her,

670
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,980
I'll call you.

671
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,180
Of course, anytime.

672
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,260
Here's my number.

673
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,700
Alright.

674
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,550
Auntie,

675
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,310
stop being so formal with me.

676
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,700
Just call me Gu.

677
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,630
How could I?

678
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,550
Why not?

679
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,740
Just call me Gu.

680
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,980
Alright, I'll take a note.

681
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,910
Cutie Gu.

682
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,550
Why are you so weird today?

683
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,390
Is it something personal?

684
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,460
No way.

685
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,980
I just promised Auntie

686
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,830
I'd take care of you.

687
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,350
How could I be against you?

688
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,660
It's not like
I did anything wrong, is it?

689
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,980
Doing laundry,

690
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,940
cooking,

691
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,830
doing the dishes, and massaging too.

692
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,460
You should get the Oscar this year.

693
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,390
Dear,

694
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,500
I'm leaving.

695
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,020
Mom,

696
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,590
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

697
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,830
Why leave so soon?

698
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm here

699
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,420
to get medicine for your grandpa

700
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,350
and stopped by to see you.

701
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,700
Your grandpa is in a rush now

702
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,220
and has no medicine. I have to go now.

703
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,980
I'm leaving now.

704
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,910
Auntie, let me get the door.

705
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,830
It's okay.

706
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,700
It's a hassle, so it's okay.

707
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
No way!

708
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,940
By the time aunt's bus leaves,

709
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,660
It'll take two hours to wait for a taxi.

710
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,150
It'll be late and the subway
will be gone.

711
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,830
It's not safe.

712
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,660
Yes!

713
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,020
You're absolutely right.

714
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,870
Then Gu,

715
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,110
thank you.

716
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,020
My pleasure, Auntie.

717
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,110
Auntie, let me tell you.

718
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,940
There's a new dim sum place downstairs.

719
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,740
I'll buy some for Grandpa.

720
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,630
You're so caring.

721
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,390
You've been staring at me
since your mom left.

722
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,350
Is there something on my face?

723
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,590
You weren't like this with my mom.

724
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,590
Do you have something in mind?

725
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,940
I do.

726
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,310
You...

727
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,590
You were appointed as the art department's
best employee yesterday.

728
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,180
Yeah.

729
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,590
They even ordered a trophy online.

730
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,830
I appreciate that.

731
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,390
I thought Mr. Jiang
was going to kill me.

732
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,070
But...

733
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,390
Not only did he not kill you,

734
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,180
he even promoted you.

735
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,460
Yeah.

736
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,740
What do you think is in his mind?

737
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,310
You were promoted because you're good
at what you do.

738
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,260
You're right.

739
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,390
I think he promoted you

740
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,220
because he wants to keep you.

741
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,790
Fair enough.

742
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,500
You were gonna come
to the 9th Business Unit,

743
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,110
to do Hero's Path anyway.

744
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,910
How can you be so sure?

745
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,630
I'm a group leader now.

746
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,070
What about it?

747
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,590
You can shine brighter

748
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,870
in the 9th Business Unit.

749
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,790
Well, I don't think so.

750
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,830
Don't feel like you've got me
in your sights.

751
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,630
Fine, let's make a bet.

752
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,980
On what?

753
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,910
If you come to us,

754
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,740

Then they made up

836

and felt ashamed.

837
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,230
So, they snuck into the security office

838
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,790
