00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,020
I'm doing this for your sake.

190
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
After all, at this time,

191
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,110
there aren't many chances
for share realization.

192
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,460
This is

193
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
the price they offered.

194
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,060
Look.

195
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,790
This price

196
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,940
is very fair indeed.

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,700
There is no reason

198
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,310
not to take a profitable deal.

199
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,380
Still, I'm not an individual shareholder
like you two.

200
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,550
I'll have to discuss this

201
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,790
with my colleagues at the office.

202
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,230
Very well.

203
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,310
Zhao,

204
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
I know

205
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,550
that you always support Stella.

206
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,940
But as you can see,

207
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,820
she's clearly fooling around.

208
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,820
If the Triple-A game doesn't release,

209
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,910
the shares we hold

210
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,550
are worthless.

211
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,790
Don't rush just yet.

212
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,230
Think about it.

213
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,910
You're a smart man.

214
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,990
Mr. Zhao,

215
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,990
a toast.

216
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,580
Zhao,

217
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,700
come on.

218
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,500
Did I forget something today?

219
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
What did you forget?

220
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,990
You forgot to hold hands.

221
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,020
Camera.

222
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,700
May all lovers be united in marriage.

223
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,430
You two...

224
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,990
Congratulations.

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,190
Well,

226
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm heading up first.

227
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,430
Only Su Zheng saw us.

228
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,820
He's not the type to gossip.

229
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,310
It shouldn't be a big problem.

230
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,580
Jiang Junnan and Chen Xinyi

231
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,550
are actually together now.

232
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,190
Wait.

233
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,990
Are you for real?

234
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
It's true.

235
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,500
Why would I lie to you?

236
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,700
I'll check if they're coming.

237
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,750
Nope. Let's wait.

238
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,190
- I want to check.
- They're still not here?

239
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,350
- Nope.
- Don't rush.

240
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,500
Why are you all here?

241
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,380
What a coincidence.

242
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,020
What were you talking about?

243
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,990
We were just talking

244
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,230
about how we now have a second couple

245
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,190
in the 9th Business Unit.

246
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,700
Who are they?

247
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,990
Jiang Junnan.

248
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,870
Chen Xinyi.

249
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,550
How can it be?

250
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,190
It's impossible. You must be mistaken.

251
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,460
- It's true.
- It's true.

252
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,790
I saw them myself last night.

253
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,940
They had the lights off

254
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,140
while in the office

255
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,670
and they were in each other's arms.

256
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,990
You mentioned they're the second couple.

257
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,230
The first couple would be...

258
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,580
You two.

259
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,140
How...

260
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,590
How did you find out?

261
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Mr. Gu.

262
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,620
You're both here, huh?

263
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,020
Are you here to drink coffee?

264
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,950
Who wouldn't figure it out?

265
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,260
Jiang Junnan is out.

266
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Let's go.

267
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,190
Let's go.

268
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,260
I'm off.

269
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,100
We've been pretending so hard
for the past few days.

270
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,270
Just what were we doing?

271
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,190
At least,

272
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,740
it was exciting.

273
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,070
That's a good point.

274
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,950
What?

275
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,020
Are you dating Chen Xinyi?

276
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,860
No.

277
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,470
Who said that?

278
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,470
Wei Han said he saw you two yesterday,

279
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,380
in each other's arms in the office.

280
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,100
To spread rumors recklessly...

281
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,310
I'm a guy. I'm fine.

282
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,740
It's not good for the girl.

283
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,100
Jiang Junnan,

284
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,140
something's off about you.

285
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,190
Not only have you not immediately
distanced yourself from her,

286
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,100
but you also care
about Chen Xinyi's feelings.

287
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,190
Do you like her?

288
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,070
No, I...

289
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,100
What's the point of me liking her?

290
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,550
She has already moved on.

291
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,710
Well, I was the one
who was slow to realize it.

292
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,430
I have one word for you.

293
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,670
Karma.

294
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,740
Wei Han.

295
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,550
Stop right there.

296
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
Stop right there.

297
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,740
Stop right there.

298
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,190
Stop!

299
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,590
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Li, and Mr. Wang

300
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,340
were walking toward the meeting room.

301
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,710
What day is it?

302
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,140
Why are all three of them here?

303
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,220
As expected, Mr. Wang
is the most powerful.

304
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,550
There's someone
carrying his bag for him.

305
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,190
The strangest thing is

306
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,140
the people from Walter Games are here.

307
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,620
Walter Games is here?

308
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,790
Why would they be here?

309
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,260
Walter Games is willing

310
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,590
to give opportunities to the young.

311
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,980
What do you think about it?

312
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,740
We support that.

313
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,380
Stella,

314
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,500
hello.

315
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,790
Hello.

316
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,590
I represent Walter Games

317
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,340
to discuss with you

318
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,590
the purchase of HC Interactive.

319
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,430
Purchase?

320
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,910
We don't need or plan for that.

321
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,500
[Mr. Wang, 30% equity in HC]

322
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,380
[Mr. Zhao, 21% equity in HC]

323
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,420
[Mr. Li, 15% equity in HC]

324
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,310
Could it be that they have...

325
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,640
Excuse me,

326
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,900
please step out for a moment.

327
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,420
We are about
to start an internal board meeting.

328
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,140
Excuse me.

329
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,790
I'm not here to discuss the prospects

330
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,820
but to notify you of the purchase.

331
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,620
I'll repeat myself.

332
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,230
Please step out for a moment.

333
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,430
See you later.

334
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,070
Gentlemen,

335
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,740
in the next three to five years,

336
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,790
the company will
find breakthrough growth.

337
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,430
Can I get you to reconsider?

338
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,380
Three to five years?

339
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,020
If we're lucky,

340
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
the Triple-A game

341
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,330
might be released.

342
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,100
However, just how much profit
will it bring in

343
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,830
is an answer no one has right now.

344
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,790
What if the game is a loss?

345
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,620
Stella,

346
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,620
don't say anymore.

347
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,830
I've already decided.

348
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,620
Deding Innovations Capital

349
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,740
has already made a decision

350
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,470
to sell off to Walter Games.

351
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm sorry, Stella.

352
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,340
Mr. Zhao,

353
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,380
you've always supported me.

354
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,980
Yes.

355
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,470
I've always supported you.

356
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,550
But

357
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,140
this is a serious matter.

358
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,500
Please let me think about it,

359
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,670
okay?

360
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,860
I have to go.

361
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,830
Excuse me.

362
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,780
[Steven]

363
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,190
Did you hear?

364
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,670
The directors are going
to sell their shares.

365
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,710
What do we do now?

366
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
Where are you going?

367
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm thinking of a plan.

368
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,500
Let's discuss this.

369
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,980
Mr. Jiang, here.

370
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,860
The Love Broker 3.0,

371
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,590
the Shining Warm-Winter Pact

372
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,430
has started, right?

373
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,070
How far has the team gotten

374
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,190
in test packaging the update?

375
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,430
We're all ready, Mr. Jiang.

376
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,310
Still, at the moment,

377
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,220
Walter Games is going
to purchase HC Interactive.

378
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,550
Should we push back the patch date?

379
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,710
We haven't announced it anyway.

380
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,190
What do you mean?

381
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,470
A major update to the game

382
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,980
will lead to a drastic increase
in profits.

383
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,380
If we give the profits

384
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,140
to Walter Games as a welcoming gift,

385
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,190
then your position is secured.

386
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,670
I'll let the team know then?

387
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,190
Mr. Gu,

388
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,710
you're here. Please sit.

389
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
Make yourself at home.

390
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,910
Mr. Gu.

391
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,980
Isn't it very interesting?

392
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,430
You insisted on going to HC Game before.

393
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,470
But after all that fuss,

394
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,470
Walter Games end up buying over HC Game.

395
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,740
I'll get to the point.

396
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,620
After you purchase HC Game,

397
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,190
what are your plans for Hero's Path?

398
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,590
I don't like it when you say that.

399
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,310
I'll be honest.

400
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,950
We want to buy HC Game

401
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,980
mainly because we like you.

402
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,380
So, what will happen
to Hero's Path in the future

403
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,620
is still your decision.

404
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,550
Still, we think

405
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,380
that there are many elements in the game

406
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,550
that can be swapped out.

407
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,830
For example?

408
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,980
For example,

409
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,950
Lin, that NPC at the start.

410
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,590
We don't think it's good
for him to hold a conch.

411
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,550
It should be changed
to a magic staff or tome.

412
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,550
Also, the main character
isn't well-designed.

413
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,470
We want the main character

414
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,710
to not belong to any factions

415
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,950
and be a wandering hero.

416
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,340
That needs to be changed.

417
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,310
Of course,

418
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,670
how the change happens

419
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,220
still depends on you.

420
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,740
If the one you want is me

421
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,910
and this game,

422
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,340
don't you think
you're going through a lot of trouble

423
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,830
by buying over HC Game?

424
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,860
We have no choice.

425
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,100
You're too hard to hire.

426
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,620
Our boss thinks
you're a little too quirky.

427
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,340
We failed to hire you twice.

428
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,910
So we decided to just buy HC Game

429
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,190
and be your boss.

430
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,950
Actually, you could have bought me over.

431
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,310
However,

432
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,100
that depends
on how much you're willing to pay.

433
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,670
Why the sudden change of mind, Mr. Gu?

434
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,510
What's really important to me is

435
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,030
to finish the game.

436
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,920
As for who invested in it and how much,

437
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,860
I see no big difference.

438
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,130
It's all negotiable.

439
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,910
All negotiable.

440
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,980
I only have one request.

441
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,980
Tell me.

442
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,310
I signed a non-compete agreement
when I was hired.

443
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,260
If I have to leave halfway through,

444
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,620
I'll have to pay back
all expenses incurred.

445
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,380
When I joined them,

446
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,260
I was very unhappy with the agreement.

447
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,310
Still, I had to sign it

448
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,190
to create the game.

449
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,070
Walter Games can

450
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,470
pay your breakup fee.

451
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,590
I have another request.

452
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,260
I need a profit share clause.

453
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,070
Even so,

454
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,670
the total cost of purchasing me

455
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,340
is only 10% of buying HC Game.

456
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,670
It's a great deal.

457
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,740
In that case,

458
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,860
we can retract the notice

459
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,740
for purchasing HC Game.

460
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,670
Wise move.

461
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,380
Very well.

462
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,260
List out the names

463
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,740
of those you'll be bringing over.

464
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,500
I've misjudged you.

465
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,190
All this time,
HC Game fully supported you.

466
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,910
Now that we're in trouble,

467
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,550
you're the first to jump ship.

468
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,910
My goal has always been
to finish the game.

469
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,430
The finances, connections,
and manpower of Walter Games

470
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,540
are greater than HC Game's.

471
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,000
If Walter Games
can give me a better deal,

472
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,720
why won't I go?

473
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,100
You're too selfish!

474
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,950
I've always supported you,

475
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,590
backing up the 9th Business Unit

476
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,590
and fighting to give you more time
and resources.

477
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,430
How could you do this to me?

478
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,670
How can you do this to the team?

479
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,470
How can you do this to your dream?

480
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,550
What you're doing...

481
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,550
I think there might
be a misunderstanding.

482
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,470
Mr. Gu is not that kind of man.

483
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,980
Indeed.

484
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,380
Even if he just wants
to complete the game,

485
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,470
I think it's a little extreme.

486
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,310
Don't jump to conclusions.

487
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,790
Let's wait.

488
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,190
Gu Xun,

489
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,910
I always thought we were true partners.

490
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
I'm doing all of this for Hero's Path.

491
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,950
I've already made up my mind.

492
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,220
This is just a notice.

493
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,710
Fine.

494
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,430
I have an announcement to make.

495
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,140
I've decided
to bring the 9th Business Unit

496
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,190
and Hero's Path

497
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,980
over to Walter Games.

498
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,020
To Walter Games?

499
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,950
Lead designer,

500
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,430
the request to change the conch

501
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,500
to a magical scepter

502
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,620
is one I can't fulfill

503
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,310
or understand.

504
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,690
Are you really sure?

505
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,390
Does Lin Zhi's design need
to incorporate Western elements too?

506
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,020
Yes.

507
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,430
What about the combat?

508
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,340
Do we need to tweak it
to be like that of ninjas, knights,

509
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,860
special forces...

510
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,470
I hope you can get the picture.

511
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,070
After this,

512
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,100
I'll talk to all of you.

513
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,670
What can't you understand
about that request?

514
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,500
I'll teach you.

515
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,950
Boss,

516
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,590
we are now changing the game's theme.

517
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,500
We have wasted so much time and energy

518
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,140
in creating a world
based on the Eastern art style.

519
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,620
Now?

520
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,340
We're suddenly changing the core
of the game to Western.

521
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,670
I just can't accept it.

522
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,910
Those who are capable can go anywhere.

523
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,100
I won't go to Walter Games.

524
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,220
She's right.

525
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,620
Before this...

526
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,280
Yes,

527
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,930
I was here for Mr. Gu.

528
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,820
The heart of the team has changed now.

529
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,860
The 9th Business Unit
is not what it was before.

530
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,710
Boss,

531
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,070
are you going with Mr. Gu?

532
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,950
While I don't quite agree
with Mr. Gu's decision,

533
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,220
this one time

534
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,950
is the last chance

535
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,500
I'm giving myself
to make a Triple-A game.

536
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
As long as we can complete it,

537
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,950
nothing else is important.

538
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,500
Jiang Junnan,

539
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,260
don't be so serious.

540
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,380
Tell me. What is it?

541
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,710
I want to ask

542
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,950
if we can change Mr. Gu's mind.

543
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,550
Everyone still wants to try saving this.

544
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,620
Xinyi,

545
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,780
saving this
is something I've thought of too.

546
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,050
It's impossible.

547
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,070
Will you support Mr. Gu

548
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,860
unconditionally?

549
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,950
Yes.

550
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,790
Why did I even ask you?

551
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,160
You were going with him anyway.

552
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,220
Xinyi,

553
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,620
did you know?

554
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,190
When I was a kid,

555
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,830
I was just a bespectacled nerd

556
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,480
who only studied and revised.

557
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,780
I was especially timid.

558
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,520
Since I met Gu Xun,

559
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,380
I understood what it's like

560
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,050
to have a dream.

561
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,340
I once swore

562
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,260
that as long as Gu Xun needs me,

563
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,850
I'll never split with him.

564
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,670
Now, he has planned out

565
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,720
the project's future.

566
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,380
I have no better solution.

567
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,600
I can only trust him

568
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,890
and work with him.

569
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,190
Also,

570
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,600
without Gu Xun,

571
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,240
I can't develop a Triple-A game
on my own.

572
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,450
I know my own limits.

573
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,310
There's no way I can do better
than what I've done.

574
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,620
After all,

575
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,890
you're doing this for your own career.

576
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,750
All these employees...

577
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,860
We've worked so hard together
for so long.

578
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,700
You know that well.

579
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,550
Did you ever care?

580
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,860
Mr. Gu, Mr. Jiang, I'll be leaving now.

581
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,470
It's just the two of us now.

582
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,710
Ask away.

583
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,950
Gu Xun,

584
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,620
while you've made up your mind,

585
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,540
I still want to say

586
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,140
that your decision

587
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,650
has not only hurt our colleagues
at the 9th Business Unit,

588
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,490
but has also
betrayed your original vision.

589
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,690
Is this really what you want?

590
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,750
What you feel for Hero's Path

591
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,750
is deeper than what we feel.

592
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,340
Think about your Dad.

593
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,540
Think about your coworkers
at the 9th Business Unit.

594
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,580
Millions may object,
but I still march on.

595
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,820
Reconsider it,

596
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,060
okay?

597
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,780
I'll drop you off at work.

598
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,540
Morning, Qianling.

599
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,270
Morning.

600
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,060
- I bought you coffee.
- Thanks.

601
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,140
You still have to eat breakfast.

602
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,820
Who would want your breakfast?

603
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,780
[Walter Games Employment Agreement]

604
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,190
Jiang Junnan.

605
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,990
Stupid Jiang Junnan.

606
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,270
He's always bullying me.

607
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,710
Xinyi,

608
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,100
didn't you once swear

609
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,030
that you'll never drink again?

610
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,470
All vows sworn for a stupid man

611
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,910
are now canceled.

612
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
Why was I so blind

613
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,100
to have liked a man like him?

614
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,990
He only cares about money
and his career.

615
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,060
He feels nothing

616
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,620
for HC Game.

617
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,910
Cheers.

618
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,430
You're doing okay.

619
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,750
You and Jiang Junnan

620
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,950
aren't together yet.

621
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,670
Think about it.

622
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,820
What am I to do?

623
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,860
I can't bear to break up with him.

624
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,430
Still, there's no way

625
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,860
I can treat him the same now.

626
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,910
If you were to say he's wrong,

627
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,430
then he is actually doing it
for the team's sake.

628
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,140
It's as if I am the one

629
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,550
who doesn't care about the big picture.

630
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,270
I am still upset.

631
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,620

Cheer.

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,030
