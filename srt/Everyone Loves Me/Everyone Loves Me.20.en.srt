00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,500
Your Uncle Guo and I

193
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,230
met with some investors today.

194
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,230
If things go well,

195
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,660
I'll be able to create that conch

196
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,300
as promised.

197
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,270
Xun,

198
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,980
I have some news.

199
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,300
Your Uncle Guo

200
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,830
left today.

201
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,390
Remember what I told you?

202
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,420
Staying motivated when no one's watching

203
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,390
is the hardest thing to do.

204
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,830
But I think

205
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,910
that persistence

206
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,390
will help us push through tough times.

207
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,950
I

208
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,500
decided to sell.

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,860
Everything.

210
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,790
The copyrights of the works

211
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,980
I've created over the years...

212
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,910
I've sold them all
to the gaming company.

213
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,710
["Copyright Transfer Agreement"
of Lin and In-Game Item Conch]

214
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,300
Do you remember the character
and the conch

215
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,540
that I promised I'd create?

216
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,390
They both have been given

217
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,860
a full upgrade,

218
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,910
which is also included

219
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,030
in the copyright transfer agreement.

220
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,540
Time

221
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,620
is a thief.

222
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,270
Another year has gone by.

223
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,270
I

224
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,030
miss you so much.

225
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,180
How...

226
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,980
How have you

227
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,300
and your mom been?

228
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,660
He had been leaving me messages.

229
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,470
Even before

230
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,790
he passed away.

231
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,230
Stella,

232
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,230
I

233
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,100
have had a devil of a job finding

234
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,500
a company willing to buy "Hero's Path."

235
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,350
The price they're offering

236
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,060
is just about enough to cover

237
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,860
the company's initial investment.

238
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Since all the board members
are here today,

239
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,470
I think we should have a meeting.

240
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,740
I even brought a letter of intent.

241
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,540
Gentlemen,

242
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,060
Gu Xun said

243
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,270
he'd come up with a solution today.

244
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,470
We've been patiently waiting

245
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,150
for the last three days.

246
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,390
Yet he's nowhere to be seen.

247
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,910
Where is he?

248
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,830
Let's all take a breath here.

249
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,300
At this stage,

250
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,060
price isn't the sole factor
when selling the game.

251
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,300
We need to take company image
and reputation into consideration.

252
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,420
But right now we're in the crosshairs.

253
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,590
Perhaps selling isn't the best option.

254
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,980
Let's just give Gu Xun more time.

255
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,350
Boss, Weline's legal team

256
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,860
is downstairs.

257
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,150
See?

258
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,030
I've told you,

259
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,100
we don't have a snowball's chance
of turning the table.

260
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,350
I'm going to call Gu Xun.

261
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,150
Hi, everyone.

262
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,950
Sorry, I'm late.

263
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,230
I was busy preparing the materials.

264
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,470
Here you go.

265
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,910
What is this?

266
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,860
The evidence to prove
copyright ownership.

267
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,900
[Guardian of the World]

268
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,340
[Bad news. The deal went awry.]

269
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,540
Gu Xun,

270
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,470
look.

271
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,500
Your dad

272
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,950
terminated the contract.

273
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,060
[Guardian of the World]
Bad news.

274
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,660
The deal went awry.

275
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,710
I didn't find out
until I reached the office

276
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,260
that they didn't want us

277
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,020
to be involved in developing the game.

278
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,710
I was furious.

279
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,300
I was going to reclaim my copyrights

280
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,750
by suing them.

281
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,020
But luckily,

282
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,710
they agreed to sign
a termination agreement.

283
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm relieved

284
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
that I still own the character
and the conch.

285
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,180
I created them for you.

286
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,300
They belong to you.

287
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,710
Your dad even registered them

288
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,180
for copyright protection
under your name.

289
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,900
He loved you

290
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,420
all long.

291
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,540
While the contract

292
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,630
was signed by both parties,

293
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,660
my dad died

294
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,020
before it arrived

295
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,260
on his desk.

296
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,750
The termination agreement
is valid though.

297
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,140
Your dad managed

298
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,750
to secure your copyrights.

299
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,780
The agreement

300
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,950
must be among the documents

301
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,950
that we brought back.

302
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,630
Let's go through them again.

303
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,110
He'd been trying

304
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,710
to reach me

305
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,260
through his conch.

306
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,900
I've been the owner of the copyrights

307
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,750
this whole time.

308
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,300
In that case,

309
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,350
we'll fulfill the deal

310
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,630
and continue to support "Hero's Path."

311
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,020
Gu Xun,

312
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,590
you need to hush it all up urgently.

313
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,300
Send them a legal notice.

314
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,140
Guys,

315
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,540
turns out

316
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,510
we own the rights.

317
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,180
That's wonderful.

318
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,140
- That's great news!
- Yeah.

319
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,590
Take a look at this.

320
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,230
Gu Xun and his dad

321
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,750
created this NPC.

322
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,660
His dad

323
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,660
got it copyrighted under his name.

324
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
I guess you could call it

325
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,110
a parting gift.

326
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,660
It wasn't a wasted trip.

327
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,230
Mr. Gu is back.

328
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,180
I appreciate everyone's hard work
over the past few days.

329
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,990
Our unit couldn't have pulled through

330
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,950
without your trust and support.

331
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,750
Mr. Jiang.

332
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,710
Thank you for your time and effort.

333
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,900
I've put a lot of effort
into "Hero's Path" too.

334
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,590
Xinyi,

335
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,420
you and I are going
to the legal department

336
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,020
to work out an announcement.

337
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,350
Sure.

338
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,350
Mr. Gu.

339
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,540
Rest well,

340
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,990

Mr. Gu,

348
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,140
look at my new VR headset.

349
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,060
It's so fun.

350
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,710
It feels so real.

351
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,870
You can fight as a boxer.

352
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,420
Want to give it a go, Mr. Gu?

353
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,540
- Mr. Gu?
- Mr. Gu.

354
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,510
Here's the document you requested.

355
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,950
I'll leave you to it.

356
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,540
What's up?

357
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,660
Mr. Gu,

358
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,710
this is a VR headset.

359
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,950
Would you like to give it a try?

360
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,780
You know how to have fun.

361
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,380
Just place it on your head.

362
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,780
Boxing.

363
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,020
It's not bad, is it?

364
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm sorry...

365
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,470
Mr. Gu, you're good at this.

366
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,660
Sorry, didn't mean it...

367
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,750
Hey, guys.

368
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,180
I have this month's list
of the employees

369
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,900
eligible for single employees benefits.

370
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,260
Come take a look.

371
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,060
Am I on the list?

372
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,110
This time...

373
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,380
there are five restaurant coupons,

374
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,260
five spa coupons,

375
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,380
a heart rate monitor watch,

376
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,710
and a limited-edition mystery box.

377
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,300
That's a lot of good stuff!

378
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,140
Now let me announce

379
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,950
the winners.

380
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,750

Actually, I did hesitate.

433
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,750
But the mystery box

434
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,300
was too good to say no.

435

You chose a mystery box over me?

436
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,350
Of course.

Well,

688
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,310
give me your phone then.

689
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,580
I'll tell you mine.

690
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,470
That won't be necessary.

It is necessary.

who's going to be the breadwinner.

693

695
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,990
All right, boss lady.

696
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,860
Not the payment password.

697
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,950

It's the first code

a programmer writes.

704
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,340
Whenever I want

705
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,990
to code or learn,

706
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,580
I use it to make sure

707
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,550
that the development environment
is correctly equipped.

708
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,140
It has become a ritual.

709
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,710
A tribute to the binary system
that I love.

710
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,950
And now a message from me to you.

711
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,310
It's in fact not a program

712
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,620
but a love message.

713
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,140
You're the first best thing

Come in.

716
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,620
Mr. Jiang, we need

717
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,620
to go into detail about how
to get more exposure for the production.

718
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,470
Mr. Jiang?

719
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,380
Yeah,

720
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,230
I think our next move...

721
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,710
Wei Han. Yi Hong.

722
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,380
Why aren't you two in my office?

723
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,340
Are we going to have a meeting or not?

724
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,180
Right away, Mr. Jiang.

725
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,230
Jiang Junnan

726
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,550
seems easy to be around.

727
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,140
I didn't think he'd be so difficult
to be pleased

728
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,340
when angered.

729
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,230
But I don't think

730
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,140
he's mad at Mr. Gu.

731
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,030
What makes you say that?

732
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,420
Mr. Jiang treats the people he hates

733
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,230
as if they're invisible.

734
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,820
But I think

735
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,950
the reason
he's giving Mr. Gu a hard time

736
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,950
is that he's waiting for Mr. Gu
to give him an out.

737
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,180
You sure know Jiang Junnan.

738
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,550
So what do we do now?

739
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,950
I do know a way.

740
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,140
But it's a little tricky.

741
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,790
It might backfire.

742
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,820
No harm in trying.

743
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,950
There's nothing worse than the unit
being dissolved, right?

744
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,710
Mr. Jiang from Project Department 1

745
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,030
is now at the 9th Business Unit
crossing swords with Mr. Gu

746
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,580
because he had
to give his office to him.

747
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:41,900
That's

748
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,950
so childish.

749
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,660
Leave me out of it.

750
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,470
A fight broke out.

751
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,860
Who struck who?

752
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,790
Mr. Jiang struck Mr. Gu.

753
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,380
How dare Jiang Yishi!

754
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,420
Gu Xun...

755
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,310
Are you all right?

756
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,230
Where did he hit you?

757
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,100
I'm fine.

758
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,270
Why couldn't you have asked for my help?

759
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,620
Why did you have to fight with him?

760
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,070
It's nothing serious.

761
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,420
Did you win or lose?

762
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,310
I won,

763
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,310
of course.

764
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
That's great.

765
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,380
How dare Jiang Yishi!

766
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,510
You're not angry anymore?

767
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,310
Is that interesting?

768
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,030
I know you wanted to get your hands
on this limited-edition resin kit.

769
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,860
I went to get it for you
as soon as it launched,

770
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,470
but it sold out.

771
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,340
I had to pull a few strings

772
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
to buy you one.

773
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,070
I don't want it.

774
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,580
Jiang Junnan.

775
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,420
You're the only person in the world

776
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,340
that I trust with all my heart.

777
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,380
You're a jerk.

778
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,790
The worst friend I could ever have.

779
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,710
I'm always

780
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,860
cleaning up your mess.

781
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,380
It will never happen again.

782
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,900
Those are just words.

783
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,230
Can you keep your promise?

784
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,070
I definitely can.

785
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,580
The resin kit cost me a lot of money.

786
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,990
Do you still want it?

787
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,580
I'm selling it online.
