1
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,560
Second Brother, Zhu Sheng

2
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,920
Why are you here?

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,480
I was worried about you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,359
Tonight your life is at stake.

5
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,599
How could I stay at the Princess's manor?

6
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,079
Of course I want to be with you.

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,480
No, tonight is extremely dangerous.

8
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,719
Let Zhu Sheng take you back now.

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,359
No.

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,480
If you don't protect me in this city,

11
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,560
my days will be even harder.

12
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,719
How could I abandon you when you're in trouble?

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,959
I appreciate your concern.

14
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,120
But you must go back.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes, Princess Nan Zhengyue.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,040
The young master has to worry about you too.

17
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,799
Don't worry, I'm here.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,120
Who cares about the Wraith King?

19
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,719
No harm will come to the young master.

20
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,120
Well... all right then.

21
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,120
This is a new Warding Sachet I made for you.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,159
It wards off evil and keeps you safe.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you satisfied now?

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
Can I leave now?

25
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,680
I also made you a special herbal soup.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,079
I'll leave after you drink it.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,159
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,120
Heavens protect us, heavens protect us.

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Heavens protect us, heavens protect us.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Hey,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,719
why do you keep fiddling with that Shadow Coin?

32
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,919
It's not even worth a jug of wine.

33
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,680
Go away, you don't get it.

34
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,159
This Shadow Coin has a big story.

35
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,639
Let me tell you,

36
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,400
my grandmother took this coin from a corpse's coffin.

37
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,080
She took it out herself.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
It's full of dark energy.

39
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
I hope it can ward off tonight's evil.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
Let me touch it too!

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,719
Hey,

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,319
we're really unlucky, aren't we?

43
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,639
We got assigned to the second young master's manor.

45
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,680
I haven't even found a wife yet.

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
You're still thinking about marriage?

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
Surviving tonight would be lucky.

48
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,479
Protect me, please.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
What?

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Did your grandmother ever say

51
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,840
what to do if the Shadow Coin cracks?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,879
That's a terrible omen.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
A terrible omen, for sure.

54
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,560
Protect me, please.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,879
Protect me, protect me, protect me.

56
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,159
Looks like we've fallen into a trap.

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,080
Search.

58
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,680
Did something happen here?

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
I don't know anything.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
Come out.

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,879
If you don't want to die with us,

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then stay back.

63
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,759
It's the young princess.

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,519
What now? Do we kill or not?

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,639
Who are you people?

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,240
Why do you want to harm my brother?

67
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,399
Didn't expect the timid little girl

68
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,439
to be so tough.

69
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,800
She's actually pretty fierce.

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,319
You know who I am,

71
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,040
and even my personality.

72
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,319
You must be from the palace.

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,839
Why bother talking to her?

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,720
It's a trap.

75
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,720
Tell me, where is Nan Zhengci?

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,839
I don't know.

77
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,399
Stubborn.

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,120
If we kill you, he'll have to show up.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

80
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,720
Damn.

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,199
Princess Nan Zhengyue, are you all right?

82
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm fine.

83
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,959
Where's the second young master?

84
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,800
Say something!

85
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,160
Second young master.

86
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,199
You arrived just in time.

87
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,120
Protect Nan Zhengyue.

88
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,079
Let's fight our way out.

89
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,000
Run!

90
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:51,959
Go!

91
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,639
Chase them!

92
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,399
Go!

93
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,120
I told you so.

94
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:07,759
In this world,

95
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,279
there's no such thing as a deadly Wraith King.

96
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,279
Just evil people pretending to be monsters.

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,759
Tell me, who sent you?

98
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,720
Speak up.

99
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,480
Maybe you'll get to keep your lives.

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Enough talk.

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,319
Still stubborn at death's door.

102
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
Be smart, end yourselves.

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
You'll suffer less that way.

104
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,240
It's not clear who'll win yet.

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Attack!

106
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,639
Open the door! Open the door!

107
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,959
Quick, block the main gate!

108
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,279
Come on, move it!

109
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,039
Brother, move aside!

110
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,840
No, this won't work for long.

111
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,080
They'll break in sooner or later.

112
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,679
We won't die with these monsters, will we?

113
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,320
Brother.

114
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,600
That would be too tragic.

115
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,919
Young master, princess.

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,639
I'll rush out first and draw them away.

117
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,879
You two escape when you can.

118
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,639
You go, I'll cover you.

119
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,159
Are you crazy?

120
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Second young master.

121
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,200
You gave me my life.

122
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,639
For both young masters,

123
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,240
Zhu Sheng's life is worth sacrificing.

124
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,879
No, that's not right.

125
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,559
Second Brother and I won't allow it.

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Brother, why did they suddenly leave?

127
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,759
Let's go.

128
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,360
Go check.

129
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,039
Where are they heading?

130
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,120
Protect Nan Zhengyue.

131
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,480
It's dawn.

132
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,960
They're heading back to their lair.

133
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
Quick, follow them!

134
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,879
Second young master.

135
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,080
Do you know what's ahead?

136
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,039
This is the Frigid Forbidden Land.

137
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,360
It is shrouded in deadly cold all year.

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,159
A place of extreme cold and darkness.

139
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,960
No one has ever come out alive.

140
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,440
When the sun rises,

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,960
the Corrupted hide inside here.

142
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,120
This is likely the Corrupted's lair.

143
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,200
Look.

144
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,679
I understand now.

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,159
Sunlight burns the Corrupted.

146
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,120
So during the day,

147
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,120
they hide in this frigid place.

148
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,720
They only come out together at night.

149
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
That makes sense.

150
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:49,960
I have a plan.

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
Only my little brother truly cares.

152
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,799
Don't worry.

153
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,559
Once your sister returns,

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,559
no one will dare bully you again.

155
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,879
By the way,

156
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,679
is the second brother dead?

157
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
That girl Nan Zhengyue

158
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,679
has hidden the second brother away.

159
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,519
And at his residence,

160
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,159
a lot of The Corrupted appeared out of nowhere.

161
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
They've thrown the whole plan into chaos.

162
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,919
Well played, Nan Zhengyue.

163
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,799
You dare go against us siblings.

164
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,000
Just wait and see how I deal with you.

165
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,039
How dare you!

166
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,559
You worthless dogs!

167
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,480
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,159
Search the residence.

169
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,399
You—
