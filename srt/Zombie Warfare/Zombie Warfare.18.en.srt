1
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,479
I really didn't expect that.

2
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,560
That's way too overbearing.

3
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,159
Exactly.

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,119
Those people are just awful.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,880
Gentlemen, your noodles are here.

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,520
What are you two chatting about? So lively.

7
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,399
Haven't you seen the notice yet?

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
Turns out The Rotting Chaos

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
was started by people from Yun Yin Mountain.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,560
They colluded with the eldest prince.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
The main culprit, the eldest prince,

12
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,719
has already been locked up.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,359
Tomorrow, the second prince

14
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,599
will personally execute those criminals.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,879
Such a big thing happened in the city,

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,599
why is the second prince handling it?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,680
What about the City Lord?

18
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,879
I heard the City Lord is gravely ill.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,799
His life hangs by a thread.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,799
He has handed all Xuan Cheng's affairs

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
over to the second prince.

22
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,200
You just said the City Lord is ill—

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,319
is that true?

24
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,920
Absolutely true.

25
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,760
Eat your noodles, eat up.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,439
Please, take your time.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,760
This is the taste.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,959
Yes, this is it.

29
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,640
Who's there?

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,040
It's me.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,879
Princess Nan Zhengyue.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,359
The second prince said

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,480
no one is allowed to visit these two.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
Please leave.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,599
I'm just here to see my brother and sister.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,280
These fine dishes and wine

37
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,280
aren't for them.

38
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,199
They're prepared for the three of you.

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
Please, could you make an exception?

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,560
Princess Nan Zhengyue is with the second prince.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,879
There won't be any trouble.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,840
Princess Nan Zhengyue, come with me.

43
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,560
Please.

44
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,680
Nan Zhengyue, why are you here?

45
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,479
Second brother will have you executed tomorrow.

46
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,759
I came especially to see you both.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,360
Any last words before you die?

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,639
That little bastard Nan Zhengci—

49
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,919
he dares to execute us?

50
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,960
Who does he think he is?

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,360
Bah!

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
If he's got guts, let him come himself.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,479
I'll kill him myself.

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,039
He doesn't know his place.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Come, let's drink.

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,599
Sister Zhengyue,

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,199
my dear little sister.

58
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,080
I knew our sibling bond was strong.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,680
You'd definitely come to save us.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Enough talk, let's go quickly.

61
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,080
Go.

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,479
Go, go, go.

63
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,759
Didn't expect you, little girl,

64
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,800
to have grown so bold.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,360
Hurry, let's go.

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,719
Go, elder sister.

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,199
Sister, wait for us!

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,199
I'm finally about to be free again.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,759
Zhu Sheng.

70
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,520
Just let us go.

71
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,919
Princess Nan Zhengyue.

72
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,199
Didn't expect you'd betray the prince too.

73
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,360
He'll be heartbroken if he finds out.

74
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
Second brother has gone astray now.

75
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,519
You can't make him turn back,

76
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,680
but you won't help him do evil.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,720
None of you are leaving today.

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Take them all back.

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,199
Stop right there, all of you!

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,600
I am the proud eldest prince of Xuan Cheng.

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,839
I've been living like a rat lately.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm done putting up with it.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Worst case,

84
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,519
I'll fight you all today.

85
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,879
Qier!

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,879
Sis, I've been shot!

87
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,240
It hurts.

88
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
Qier!

89
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
Elder sister, I don't want to die!

90
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,920
It's okay, I'm here.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,439
Eldest prince Nan Zhengqi,

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
Princess Nan Zhengyan,

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,879
attempted to escape and kidnapped Princess Nan Zhengyue.

94
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,519
With ill intent.

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
Stop! You can't do this!

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,959
Release the arrows!

97
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,959
Elder sister!

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,560
Qier!

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,839
Elder sister!

100
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,480
Qier!

101
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,519
Qier!

102
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,079
Qier!

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,759
Qier!

104
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,399
Big brother!

105
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,600
Elder sister!

106
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,319
Elder sister!

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,079
Come, second prince.

108
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,839
To our soon-to-be great achievement,

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,879
cheers!

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Since you're here,

111
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,240
come on in.

112
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,120
It's done.

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
Dong Qing is already lying in the stone coffin in the mist cave.

114
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,800
If you don't believe me,

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,199
go see for yourself.

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,959
Truly, sibling bonds run deep.

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,560
Where's the greenfish stone?

118
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,959
Enough for half a month.

119
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,920
You should know better.

120
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,240
Come.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
The greatest poison master in the world—

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
just an empty title.

123
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,879
Nothing but a name.

124
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,360
What do you mean by that?

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
The so-called greatest poison master

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,519
can't even cure his own brother.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,399
Ridiculous.

128
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,000
Truly ridiculous.

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
No need for the State Preceptor to worry.

130
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,879
Without our Mo Cheng's gu worms,

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,199
how would Nan Zhengci have so many rotting soldiers?

132
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,040
You and your white-haired freak brother

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,399
wouldn't have survived till now.

134
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,319
Show some respect.

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
Or I'll turn you into rotters too.

136
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,879
Is that so?

137
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,959
This disguise technique lasts only three days.

138
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,079
If we don't find Master Bukku by then

139
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,000
and rescue everyone,

140
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,319
you must leave as well.

141
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,279
Get out!

142
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,960
Didn't expect the princess to have such a temper.

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Out!

144
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,600
Tomorrow night, you'll be mine.

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,399
My second brother is conspiring with you.

146
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,120
But the people of Xuan Cheng

147
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,559
won't forget the evil Mo Cheng did

148
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,559
They will never forget

149
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,759
Neither will I

150
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,320
I promise you’ll end up with nothing

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,799
The once fragile little princess

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,600
has grown up now

153
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,519
W-What did you say?

154
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,279
If the old Lord were still here

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
he’d be proud of the princess’s change

156
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
Princess Zhengyue, it’s me

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,360
Master Dong Qing, is it really you?

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Princess Zhengyue

159
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,200
We can’t let Nan Zhengci keep making mistakes

160
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,559
We must stop him

161
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,360
I came here today

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
to ask for your help

163
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,879
But I’m so useless

164
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,559
What can I even do?

165
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,519
You’re the only one who can do this

166
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
Xuan Cheng’s future is in your hands

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,960
Zhu Sheng, Zhu Sheng

168
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,559
Princess Zhengyue

169
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,559
Why are you in such a hurry?

170
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
I have something important to tell you

171
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,879
Dong Qing isn’t dead

172
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,039
He’s pretending to be the State Preceptor of Mo Cheng

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,279
He and Fengwu Zhou are plotting to harm my second brother

174
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,919
What?

175
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,240
Is that true?

176
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,039
It’s true

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,080
He just came to me under the pretense of delivering my wedding dress

178
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
He wants me to cooperate with their plan

179
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,559
Though I resent my brother marrying me off to Mo Cheng

180
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,639
he’s still my real family

181
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,279
I won’t truly betray him

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,240
If you don’t believe me

183
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,080
go check the Mist Cave

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,039
The body inside

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,600
will show you if it’s Dong Qing or not

186
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,840
Dong Qing is right here

187
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,759
Princess Zhengyue lied to me

188
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,159
She didn’t lie to you

189
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,120
State Preceptor

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,559
You all

191
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
Why are you together?

192
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,399
Are you trying to double-cross each other?

193
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,559
Enough talk

194
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,159
Take me to Master now

195
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,639
