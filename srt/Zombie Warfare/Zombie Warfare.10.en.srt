1
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,200
This Royal Physician is truly remarkable.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
So many precious medicinal herbs are drying in the courtyard.

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
If Master were here,

4
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,640
he would surely be envious.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,679
It seems Master Dongqing

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,959
shares a deep bond with Master Bukku.

7
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,959
Of course.

8
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,200
Master raised me since I was a child.

9
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,799
I have no parents.

10
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,640
Master's kindness to me

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
is something I will never forget.

12
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,920
We are not father and son,

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
but closer than father and son.

14
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,079
You could say that.

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,239
That's truly enviable.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,519
Please don't tease me.

17
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,439
You are the Second Young Master of Xuan City.

18
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,640
Admired by thousands.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,120
Truly blessed by the heavens.

20
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,359
There's nothing to envy about me.

21
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,640
I suppose Master Dongqing

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,920
has heard some rumors about my background.

23
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,920
Not just the officials and commoners,

24
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,959
even seeking my father's approval

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,840
is just a distant hope.

26
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,599
Those are just rumors.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,040
Rumors end with the wise.

28
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,959
You don't need to take it to heart.

29
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,280
Let's not talk about this.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,319
Master Dongqing, have you found any clues?

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
I found that these herbs

32
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,360
are exactly the materials used in the ink on the bill.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,599
Could it be

34
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,639
that Father's seal

35
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,520
is the most valuable thing in all of Xuan City?

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,919
If it were truly lost,

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,159
how could Father not know?

38
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,319
Unless

39
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,000
the Furen Rebellion—

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,719
Father was involved in it too.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,599
No, no, no.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,080
It's too early to draw conclusions.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,120
Besides,

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,199
even if Lord doesn't acknowledge you,

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
he wouldn't want to take your life.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,159
There are plenty who want me dead.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
Maybe everything

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
is only just beginning.

49
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,560
Husband.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,960
Husband.

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,800
What's wrong?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Husband.

53
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:11,960
Husband.

54
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,159
Husband.

55
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,159
Here, have some porridge.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Get out.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,039
Please calm down, husband.

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,919
I won't mention visiting Xuan City again.

59
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,039
It's all my fault for being thoughtless.

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,759
I've upset you.

61
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,159
Please don't punish yourself because of my mistake.

62
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't hurt yourself.

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,599
It truly makes me both scared and heartbroken.

64
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,960
Come, husband.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,759
Have a sip.

66
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,680
It's hot, it's hot.

67
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,400
Don't say such silly things.

68
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,520
Just like you did for me before.

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,719
Just bear with it, it will pass.

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Come on, drink.

71
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,360
Drink.

72
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,199
Drink.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,639
I gave you a chance.

74
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,720
Why do you think I'm here now?

75
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,279
Qier is my life.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,439
If I lose my life,

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,199
who would have time to play with you here?

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,480
The Lord of the city has passed away.

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,000
The top officials on the Ghost King list

80
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,160
have all died.

81
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,839
According to the order on the list,

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,759
today it should be Ci'er’s turn.

83
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,000
What should we do?

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,920
We will do our utmost

86
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,480
to protect the safety of the Second Young Master.

87
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,199
Good.

88
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,720
Father, please don’t worry.

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
Someone as good as Second Brother

90
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,120
is surely blessed with great fortune.

91
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
Even the Ghost King can’t harm him.

92
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,319
Tonight, he will surely turn calamity into blessing.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,399
Right, Second Brother?

94
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,399
The Young Master speaks

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
as if you’re close with the Ghost King.

96
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,000
Xiao Zhusheng.

97
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,920
Why are you so sharp-tongued?

98
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,360
Then I’ll leave Second Brother’s safety to you.

99
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,519
There won’t be any problem, right?

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Of course.

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,079
I will never let the Second Young Master be harmed.

102
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,439
Especially by those with ulterior motives.

103
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
You rude brat.

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
Believe it or not, I’ll sew your mouth shut.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,120
Enough.

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,439
Your Second Brother’s life is at stake today.

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
And you’re still making sarcastic remarks.

108
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,600
Father, please calm your anger.

109
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,800
Don’t let your temper flare.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,600
General Huo.

111
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,240
Assign more guards.

112
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,079
Make sure to protect the Second Young Master.

113
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

114
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,600
Fatherly kindness and filial piety.

115
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,439
It truly is a blessing for Xuan City.

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,920
Sister.

117
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,800
Sis.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,959
Yan’er.

119
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,560
Father, your daughter has returned.

120
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,519
Yan’er, have a seat.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,639
You suddenly returned from Yao City in mourning clothes.

122
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,519
Could it be...

123
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,399
Father.

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,199
Your daughter is now a widow, finally free.

125
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,199
Aren’t you happy for your daughter?

126
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,040
Let me ask you.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
How did the Lord of Yao City die?

128
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,240
I left you and served as a hostage in Yao City for years.

129
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,759
The supplies and weapons I brought back may not be tens of thousands of carts,

130
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,040
but there are still several thousand.

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,839
Shouldn’t you care about your daughter?

132
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,920
That’s right, Eldest Sister.

133
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,360
How did that old man die so conveniently?

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,439
Don’t worry, Father.

135
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,759
I won’t bring any trouble to Xuan City.

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,120
That old scoundrel left when his time came.

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
The Young Lord of Yao City

138
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,920
is grateful to Xuan City.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,519
Enough.

140
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,480
You’ve stayed in Yao City too long.

141
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,199
You’ve even forgotten Xuan City’s rules.

142
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,879
I wouldn’t dare.

143
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,120
Just now, seeing Father

144
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,680
punishing your eldest son over a bastard

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
was as bold as ever.

146
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,519
How could I not respect you?

147
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,399
Exactly, Eldest Sister.

148
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,000
Now that you’re back, someone can speak for me.

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,079
Father doesn’t trust me.

150
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,199
He only trusts that bastard.

151
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Guards, take the Young Master away.

152
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,639
Thirty strokes of the cane.

153
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,319
What?

154
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,879
Yes.

155
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,279
Father.

156
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,360
Father.

157
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
Father, spare me! Father!

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,879
Eldest Sister, save me! Sister!

159
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,680
Look at what you’ve done.

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,639
Father.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,279
If this happens again,

162
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,560
you may cut out my tongue.

163
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,399
Please spare my brother this time.

164
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,480
If I ever hear

165
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
you speculate about his origins again,

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
I will not forgive you.

167
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:34,799
Enough.

168
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,080
Go back to your Huanshu Hall.

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,919
Without my permission,

170
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,600
you are not to step outside.

171
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,240
Leave.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,720
Yes.

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,679
It hurts.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,559
It hurts.

175
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,440
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

176
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,200
It hurts.

177
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,600
Does it hurt that much?

178
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,799
It hurts.

179
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,600
Father hit me.

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,159
That pain is just on the skin.

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,000
But when you hit me, it hurts in my heart.

182
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,879
Do you think I want to do this?

183
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Do you know how much it pains me, sister?

184
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,639
But you act recklessly.

185
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,679
If I don't punish you a bit,

186
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,879
you won't learn your lesson.

187
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,919
I know, elder sister.

188
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,039
Mother passed away early.

189
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,639
You are like a mother to me.

190
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,000
You're the only family I have left.

191
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,840
Even if you wanted my life,

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,080
I would give it to you.

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't say such nonsense.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,080
When we were young, Father was always away at war.

195
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,440
In this vast palace,

196
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,679
it was just the two of us relying on each other.

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,559
We are each other's support.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,759
You are my life.

199
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,840
Elder sister, about our second brother...

200
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,720
I have only one brother, and that's you.

201
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,200
If that little bastard dares to bully you,

202
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,039
I won't let him get away with it.

203
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
After tonight,

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,039
no one will ever step over me again.

205
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
or bully me.
