1
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,840
Brother, have some water.

2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,679
What's up with General Huo?

4
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,799
He rushed off last night,

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,959
and still hasn't come back.

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Now we have to stand guard

7
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,359
in his place.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Don't worry about it.

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,439
Hunting the Corrupted, finding Master Dongqing—

10
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,879
that's our duty anyway.

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,040
I just wonder

12
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,120
what trouble General Huo ran into.

13
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,799
What's that delicious smell?

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,760
Soldiers, it's cold and late.

15
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,760
I've brought wine and food for everyone.

16
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,680
To warm us up.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Thank you, Princess Yue.

18
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,840
Much appreciated, Princess Yue.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,079
Thank you, Princess Yue.

20
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,840
Come, come, come.

21
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,760
Great, thanks!

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,760
Come on, come on.

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,000
Here, Master Dongqing.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,640
Thank you.

25
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,040
Wait.

26
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,040
What's wrong?

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,239
Mistress.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
Why are you so cautious today?

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,439
You even doubt Princess Yue.

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,439
It's nothing.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,800
Better safe than sorry.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Refreshing.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
Master Dongqing.

34
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,560
Master Dongqing.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,360
Princess Yue.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,439
This is chicken from Jingxiang House, south of the city.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
It's really tasty.

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,199
You should try it.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
Alright, alright!

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Smells amazing!

41
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,800
Have one.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,919
You little glutton.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Save one for your brother.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Don't eat them all yourself.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Princess Yue.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
This Warding Sachet—

47
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,479
You, the second prince,

48
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,439
and Zhusheng

49
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,319
never take it off.

50
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,240
Is there something special about it?

51
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,800
Since my brother was wounded in the battle at Mo City,

52
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,319
he's never fully recovered.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
He asked me to make this sachet.

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,560
It's said to ward off cold and evil.

55
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,719
And helps focus the mind.

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,599
May I borrow it for a moment?

57
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,360
Cinnabar, mugwort,

58
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,199
realgar, mica,

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,759
and stone fungus.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

61
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,879
Master Dongqing.

62
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,919
You know about making herbal scents?

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
I know a little.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,919
But there's one more ingredient

65
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,479
I can't identify by smell.

66
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,280
Could you tell me, Princess?

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,479
There's one more herb.

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,360
It's yellow root my brother brought from the border.

69
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
It cures poison and sores,

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,759
kills pests and relieves itching.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
After my brother was wounded in battle,

72
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,800
he couldn't be healed.

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
His leg was covered in sores.

74
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,919
Most of it was festering.

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
He used this local remedy,

76
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,680
and finally got better.

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,759
I see.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,919
The second prince really suffered.

79
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,039
A prince of such status,

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,240
yet endured so much pain.

81
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,240
Master Dongqing.

82
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,919
If you like the sachet,

83
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll give it to you.

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,719
I can't accept that.

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
It's fine, just a sachet.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,879
No, no.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,639
It's too valuable.

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
You must keep it.

89
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,080
This...

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,319
Everyone, be careful!

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,800
These Corrupted are stronger now.

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
Get the torches ready!

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,600
Isn't he the second prince's guard?

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,199
Could the second prince also...

95
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,319
Radish, protect Princess Yue!

96
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,240
Yes!

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
The Corrupted are evolving so fast.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
What's causing it?

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's survive tonight first.

100
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,879
Go away!

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
All of you, get back!

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Brother!

103
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,079
Brother, you're finally here!

104
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,279
Thank goodness you're safe.

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,240
I thought you...

106
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,279
How could anything happen to me?

107
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,800
With me here, no one can hurt you.

108
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,759
So it was you.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Master Dongqing.

110
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,079
Stop resisting.

111
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,199
Save your strength.

112
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,000
You'll need it for the road to the underworld.

113
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,160
General Huo.

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,720
Brother, please!

115
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,800
Spare them.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,759
Stop fighting.

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,639
Brother!

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,839
Brother!

119
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,759
General Huo.

120
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,839
Brother.

121
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,959
Radish.

122
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,079
Radish, are you okay?

123
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,480
Senior, it hurts so much.

124
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,720
Don't be afraid, I'm here with you.

125
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,399
Senior...

126
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,040
As the top disciple of Yun Hidden Mountain,

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,839
I might be leaving before you.

128
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,959
Don't say nonsense.

129
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,199
Hang in there.

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll get you out of here, I promise.

131
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
Senior...

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,759
Actually, I know...

133
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,519
You let me be Yun Hidden Mountain's top disciple.

134
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,839
This Soulcleaver...

135
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,759
You gave it to me for protection.

136
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,120
Now, I'm giving it back to you.

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
Stop joking around.

138
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,959
Senior...

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
Take it, quickly.

140
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,840
Defend our sect's honor.

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
You always play with that old stick.

142
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,960
It's not cool at all.

143
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,519
If you find Master Dongqing,

144
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,960
please tell him for me...

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,639
that in my next life,

146
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,679
I want to be his disciple again.

147
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,240
Radish...

148
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,759
Radish...

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Radish...

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,879
Radish...

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,720
Dongqing...

152
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,600
Go, Radish! Hurry!

153
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Go, Dongqing! Go, Radish!

154
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,559
Hurry, go!

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
Go!

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,480
The Frigid Wastes are just ahead.

157
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,440
Are we really going to die here today?

158
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
I'll kill them all.

159
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,759
I'll avenge Radish.

160
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:05,960
Dongqing...

161
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,679
The dead can't come back.

162
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
Radish wants you to live well.

163
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,320
Dongqing, go now!

164
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,559
Go, Dongqing!

165
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,519
Come.

166
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,399
Dongqing...

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
Dongqing, what's wrong?

168
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,600
You were bitten by The Corrupted.

169
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,759
Listen to me.

170
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,679
If I really turn into The Corrupted,

171
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,960
kill me with one strike.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,919
Quick!

173
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,200
Kill me now!

174
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't want to become The Corrupted.

175
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
No, you can't! No!

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,360
There must be a way.

177
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,360
We'll get out together.

178
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,360
There must be a way.

179
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,000
We...

180
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,919
Go.

181
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,840
Dongqing...

182
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,200
Dongqing...

183
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,279
Dongqing...

184
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:37,799
Sister...

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,519
Dongqing...
