1
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,519
Come on!

2
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,879
Come catch me!

3
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,599
Come on!

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,280
Come on!

5
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:36,799
Come.

6
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,080
Thank you for your hard work, soldiers.

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,080
To prevent The Corrupted from returning,

8
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,199
stay alert and guard this place tonight.

9
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,560
You are all heroes of Xuan Cheng.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,879
Yes, Second Young Master.

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,479
You have all fought bravely against The Corrupted.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,479
Tonight, good food and wine await you.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
Thank you, Second Young Master.

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,759
Dongqing.

15
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,000
Your method worked,

16
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,639
but don't be so reckless next time.

17
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,919
You're the hope of Xuan Cheng's people.

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Understood.

19
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,759
My senior hurt his hand this time.

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,479
If he gets hurt elsewhere next time,

21
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,159
how will Xuan Cheng compensate us?

22
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,199
He did it to himself. No need to pay.

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,319
Right, right.

24
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,439
It's just a scratch, not worth mentioning.

25
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,039
Easy, easy.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,919
The Corrupted in the mist cave

27
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
should be mostly cleared out.

28
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,319
But the source of The Corrupted remains unknown.

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,159
We must not let our guard down.

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,919
Look.

31
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,199
What's this?

32
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,479
Ebony hairpin.

33
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,840
Mo Cheng is known for its ebony.

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
This is the most common

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,759
hair accessory for women in Mo Cheng.

36
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,560
If these Corrupted were once from Mo Cheng,

37
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,479
then the Corrupted crisis

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,479
may have been caused by Mo Cheng people.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,319
Strange.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
It is strange indeed.

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,400
By the way,

42
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,879
I have another matter.

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,400
Yesterday, I went to the palace

44
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,840
but was turned away by the Second Young Master's guards.

45
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,800
The Corrupted run rampant,

46
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,639
and the Lord is gravely ill.

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Not seeing him

48
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,599
leaves me uneasy.

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,919
I must find a way to see for myself.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,439
Do you need us to go with you?

51
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,599
No need.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,439
I am a general of this nation.

53
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,680
No one can trouble me.

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Then...

55
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,199
Be careful.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,120
Don't worry.

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll go get ready.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,959
Master's wife.

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm hungry.

60
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,079
I want pastries.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,680
Alright.

62
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,720
Since you're hurt,

63
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,879
I'll indulge you this time.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,839
Thank you, master's wife.

65
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,720
Senior brother.

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
Why did you send her away on purpose?

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
Luobo.

68
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,759
Xuan Cheng is very dangerous.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Except for you and me,

70
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,959
we can't trust anyone easily.

71
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,839
Senior brother.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
What do you mean by that?

73
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,519
Mo Cheng and Yao Cheng have always been close.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
The Princess returns at this time—

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
the timing is delicate.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,800
And Feng Wuzhou—

77
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,800
she wears our master's tiger tooth.

78
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,959
She can't escape suspicion.

79
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,879
As for the Second Young Master...

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
Second Young Master.

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,360
You don't suspect him, do you?

82
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,439
Hard to say.

83
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,399
But my gut tells me

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
he's not that simple.

85
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,800
I don't believe it.

86
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,000
The Second Young Master is the best

87
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,079
and most wronged in Xuan Cheng.

88
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,439
How could you suspect him?

89
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,000
I hope my instincts are wrong.

90
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,519
Father.

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,680
Last night, I led the troops myself

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,199
and wiped out The Corrupted in the mist cave.

93
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:57,920
Well?

94
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,399
I didn't let you down, did I?

95
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,399
Now,

96
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,160
the people and officials all support me.

97
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,600
I, Nan Zhengci, injured my leg for Xuan Cheng.

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Now I nearly lost my life.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,439
I've finally earned everyone's approval.

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
Father, will you finally

101
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,600
give me some praise?

102
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,639
Don't worry, Father.

103
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,720
I will be your proudest child.

104
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,079
The Lord hasn't called us for five days.

105
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,240
I wonder how his illness is.

106
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes.

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,079
Could something have happened?

108
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,399
General Huo.

109
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,399
You have the Lord's trust.

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,079
Has he said anything?

111
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,360
The Lord fell ill suddenly.

112
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,879
I know you two feel the same as I do.

113
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:07,959
Don't worry.

114
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,800
I've sent a eunuch to deliver a message.

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,240
If the Lord lets me see him at court,

116
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,040
I'll be at ease knowing he's well.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,439
The Lord says he's unwell

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,360
and needs rest.

119
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,160
No need to meet today.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
Please, everyone, go back.

121
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,199
Live chickens and ducks!

122
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,439
Come and take a look!

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,480
Selling cheap!

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,839
Sir.

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,959
These chickens and ducks are home-raised.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,399
They're lively and healthy.

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,439
Every one must be alive and fresh.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,879
If any are sick or dead,

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll come back and overturn your stall.

130
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,279
Don't worry, sir.

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
One thousand.

132
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,920
Deliver to this address.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Here's the deposit.

134
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,000
Rest assured, sir.

135
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,279
All fresh, all alive.

136
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,040
Bah!

137
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,439
Alive, dead—what's the difference?

138
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,319
So many demands.

139
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,839
Pluck it alive, toss it in the pot—

140
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,199
it's dead either way.

141
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
It's done.

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,879
Rest easy, Young Master.

143
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,519
Great appetite—none left.

144
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,439
Next time, use a different stall.

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,399
So many live birds together

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,600
draws too much attention.

147
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,319
Yes.

148
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
What were those scenes just now?

149
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,519
Who am I, really?

150
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,440
Poison Master

151
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,120
Poison Master

152
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,840
Me

153
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Sister

154
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,840

160
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,559
Poison Master

161
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,600
Sister

162
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,600
Poison Master

163
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,399
Sister

164
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,240

00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,360
Sister

168
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,960
Poison Master

169
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,639

170
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,120

Poison Master

173

Sister

174
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,159
Poison Master

175
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,919
Sister

176
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,399
Poison Master

177
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,080
Sister

178
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,639

Poison Master

183
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,240
Sister

184
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,360
The greatest Poison Master,
Feng Wuzhou

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,679
Welcome back
