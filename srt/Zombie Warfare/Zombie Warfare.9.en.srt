1
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,079
It's a corpse uprising.

2
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,200
Everyone, be careful.

3
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,599
These corpses

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,599
are much stronger than the undead we faced before.

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
Second Young Master, are you alright?

6
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,159
They're getting stronger.

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Senior Brother, if we don't finish this quickly,

8
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,680
we won't be able to hold on.

9
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm fine.

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,879
I can still fight these monsters.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
A wise man knows when to retreat.

12
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,319
Fall back!

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,919
Could he be

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
Wang, the physician?

15
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,280
He was turned into a corpse.

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
It's like catching a turtle in a jar.

17
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,719
We were too careless.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,719
Undead or corpse, it doesn't matter.

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,639
Charge out and leave no survivors!

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
They're afraid of fire.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,520
Light the fire!

22
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,400
It's my injured leg that's slowing everyone down.

23
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,719
This isn't the time to talk about that.

24
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,159
Is there any way out?

25
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,159
Why are you asking me?

26
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,719
Because you're the Master's Wife.

27
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,240
It's difficult.

28
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,039
Strange...

29
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,159
What's that sound outside?

30
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,680
Why did they suddenly change direction?

31
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,719
Our reinforcements must have arrived.

32
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
Why is there another group coming?

33
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,759
Now...

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,800
We're doomed.

35
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,919
Why are there more undead?

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,120
Hurry, go!

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Go!

38
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:28,879
Master's Wife

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,839
Master's Wife

40
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,120
Burn her!

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,959
Burn this witch!

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,879
Witch!

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
Burn this witch!

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Burn her! Burn her!

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,079
Burn this witch!

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,399
She must be burned!

47
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,160
Burn her! Burn this witch!

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Burn her!

49
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,879
Mother

50
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,519
Mother! Mother!

51
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,839
Burn this witch!

52
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,240
Mother, burn her! Burn her!

53
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Hurry, burn her! Burn her!

54
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,519
Keeping her is a disaster.

55
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,240
Burn this witch!

56
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,040
Sister

57
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,800
Sister, eat.

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,079
Two petty thieves.

59
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,800
How dare you steal food in our village!

60
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,399
We just found it.

61
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,319
We found it.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,439
I'll teach you to steal!

63
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't hit us! We won't steal again!

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,480
Don't hit us! Will you steal again?

65
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,000
Will you steal again?

66
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,079
Don't hit us! Let you steal, huh?

67
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,600
Steal...

68
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,639
Don't hit us! I'll beat you to death!

69
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,800
Hit!

70
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
Don't hit us! I let you steal?

71
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,360
Don't hit us!

72
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,160
Let you steal!

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,560
Don't hit us!

74
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,399
Don't hit us!

75
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't hit us!

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't worry.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
It's safe here.

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,199
No one will hurt you.

79
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,519
I... I...

80
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,199
I picked some wild fruit for you.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Do you want to try some?

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,240
I really like them.

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,319
Senior Brother

84
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,000
You said Feng Wuzhou was strong as an ox before.

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
He was perfectly fine.

86
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,519
Why did he suddenly faint?

87
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,120
There are still two silver needles in her skull.

88
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
It's the silver needles causing trouble.

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
What? There are still silver needles inside?

90
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,439
Keep your voice down.

91
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,240
Don't let her hear.

92
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,560
There are still silver needles left.

93
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,160
The people from Yunyin Mountain are useless.

94
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,879
They actually let the Young Master get hurt.

95
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,079
If I were there,

96
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,279
I'd risk my life to keep the Young Master safe.

97
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,920
Dongqing is at least a righteous man.

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
He's been pretty good to me too.

99
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,279
Is it genuine or just an act?

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,360
It's hard to say.

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,199
How is Yue'er?

102
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,879
I've been comforting Princess Yue.

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,639
She should feel much better now.

104
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,680
The Young Master and Princess Yue

105
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,319
truly have a deep sibling bond.

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
Young Master, did that hurt?

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,439
It's nothing.

108
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,439
I got a minor injury this time,

109
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,360
but the real corpse was hit by accident.

110
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,680
We destroyed the undead.

111
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,519
So it was an unexpected gain.

112
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,879
Master, be gentle.

113
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,399
You little rascal.

114
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,960
You even dared to touch your uncle master's prized possession.

115
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,720
You deserved that beating.

116
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,399
This time,

117
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,960
he dislocated your arm.

118
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,320
If it happens again,

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,039
who knows what he'll break next.

120
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,879
Master.

121
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,039
I can move it now.

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,720
It really doesn't hurt anymore.

123
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,879
Master.

124
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I did all this for you.

125
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,759
You little brat.

126
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,159
Delicious roast rabbit.

127
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,080
How is it?

128
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,080
It's average.

129
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,759
Just average.

130
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,360
Then don't eat it.

131
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,039
I'll eat it.

132
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,080
You brat, you're really eating it?

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,399
Put it down!

134
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,159
Didn't you say you wouldn't eat it?

135
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,799
Stop right there!

136
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,320
You little brat, if it's average, don't eat it!

137
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,519
Master.

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
It's all my fault, I'm useless.

139
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,799
I still haven't found your whereabouts.

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,759
It's me.

141
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Ow, ow, ow!

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,039
It hurts, it's killing me!

143
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,279
Useless, useless!

144
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,240
Useless!

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Calm down, Young Master.

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,919
What happened last night?

147
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,919
So many undead,

148
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
and all of you living people,

149
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,919
how did you let Second Young Master and Dongqing escape?

150
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,360
Please calm down, Young Master.

151
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,320
Everything was going smoothly.

152
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,759
But we didn't expect

153
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,320
a group of vicious corpses to appear halfway through.

154
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,960
Even Doctor Wang turned into a corpse.

155
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,480
It caught us off guard, Young Master.

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
What?

157
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,279
Even Doctor Wang turned into a corpse?

158
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,399
Then...

159
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,159
I want this investigated thoroughly.

160
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,639
Not only did they trick Awu away,

161
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,919
they even took Doctor Wang.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
Those are my people.

163
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
Only I get to kill them.

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,919
And another thing,

165
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,519
take my decree

166
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,759
and bring the death squad back from outside the city.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,879
Yes, yes.

168
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Since you're all so capable,

169
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,480
that you lost almost all my undead,

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,759
let's see

171
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,039
if your luck is stronger

172
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,799
or my blade is sharper.
