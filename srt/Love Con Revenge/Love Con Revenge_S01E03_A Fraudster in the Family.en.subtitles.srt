We gotta go now. Let's go. Let's go.
Now, now, now. Go, go, go.

[Cecilie] We need to go.

Shit, is that him?

00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,158
Looking your tormentor in the face

7
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,369
and showing them
that you're not scared of them anymore

8
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,288
is a great way to take your power back.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,622
Hi, Ricky.

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,584
Hi. I'm Bri.

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,463
Um, Bridget said
you stole a lot of money from her.

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,049
-Is that true?
-I think you have the wrong person.

-No.

-You guys get the cameras away from me.
-No, what happened to the money?

16

-You guys can get away from me. [laughs]
-No. What happened to the money?

17
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,399
Seriously. What happened to the money
you stole out of the ATM?

in El Paso together.

23
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,872
[Brianne] Clarence's family said
he died in an IED attack.

24
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,041
He didn't take a bullet for you.

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,001
[Bridget] I gave you money.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,128
-To send to Clarence's family.
-You never. You never.

27
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,924
[Brianne] We've met Clarence's family.
We know they don't have the money.

Clarence doesn't even have

-[Ricky] And?

-Please, tell me.
-I don't need to tell you anything.

00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,362
Stole from me?

With limited resources and no leads,

it's not like the police will go
actively out to hunt them down.

He was in the military.

And he goes by the name of Ricky Morrisey.

68
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,637
[Brianne] When a perpetrator
has crossed state lines,

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,014
it's clear that they don't wanna be found.

70
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,432
They know the risks.

71
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:31,145
And they're willing to do anything
to avoid being prosecuted.

72
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,566
It really bothers me
how easy it's been for Ricky to get away.

73
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,735
Like, there's an arrest warrant
out for him.

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,196
Seems like
the police aren't doing anything.

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,534
When we get a new lead,
it's imperative that we act on it quickly.

'Cause every minute that we wait,

77
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:52,292
it gives them time to clean up, regroup,
and move on to a different location.

that Bridget is gonna give up.

Ricky and I matched on Tinder,

97

and he basically told me
that he was a cell phone reseller.

98

He was from the Boston area.

99

One of the reasons
why he was leaving Boston

100
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,776
is he did have an ex-girlfriend there.
It just didn't work out.

101
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,112
He did tell me that
she was a little bit, you know,

102
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,866
on the crazy side
and that he tried to make it work.

103
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,951
But it was just… It was really tough.

105
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,333
First time we met,
he was in some type of hot ride,

106
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,919
kind of like,
Fast and the Furious type of, like, vibe.

107

And as soon as I walked out my front door,

108
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,173
he came up right to me.

109
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,591
He gave me a hug,

110
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,886
opened the car door for me, let me in.

111
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,015
It was… a great feeling.
Like, it was just…

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,311
I don't-- Just-- I got a little bit
of, like, the butterflies in the stomach.

113
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:40,066
I mean,
the first date we spent all day together.

114
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,529
So, I feel our connection
just got so strong,

115
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,406
just on that first date.

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,327
-How long were you together?
-[Jeannie] Maybe two months.

that he should be doing in his thirties,

for the first part of it.

to defraud you?

[Jeannie] After we were seeing each other
for a month.

131
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:33,911
He basically told me that he had
a big cell phone deal that was happening.

00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,206
He does a lot of overseas sales.

133

Since he was in the Army,
he met a lot of people.

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,585
Okay.

135
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,880
There was a partner
coming in from Saudi Arabia,

136
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,967
to buy off these cell phones for $50,000.

137
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,261
The deal does not go through.

138
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,307
He has some old friends

139
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,810
from Boston that loaned him the money,

140
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,398
and now he's in a lot of trouble
because they were loan sharks.

141
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,817
And he needed to pay this loan back.

He says, "I thought somebody was
following me. I was trying to run away."

00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,332
And I'm like,
"Why don't you just come over?"

"Jeannie, I can't come over to you.
They know… They know where you live."

Were you scared?

I still have nightmares.

151
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,758
He said the loan sharks
were gonna attack us.

152
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,054
I think of somebody getting into my house
and it scares the shit out of me.

153
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,890
And that's what I asked him. "Can I help?"

154
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,519
'Cause I wanted to do something.
And I said, "What if I take out a loan?"

155
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,192
And he drove me over there during lunch,

156
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,986

And I'm like,
where the fuck did this money go?

175
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:41,205
I just handed you $12,000,
and now you have stuff.

176
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,543
He's like, "No, I traded in the old one.
Remember I didn't like the old one?"

And the worst, I think one of the worst,
and this is probably when it gets hard,

182
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,062
is that I don't have anybody to go to.

I was absolutely crazy
for doing something so stupid.

-You need to stop saying that it's stupid.
-[Jeannie] I know.

He's moved on from Bridget.

00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,015
It seems like he has a whole new scam.
She doesn't know if he's still here,

the address where he's been staying.

and he also ran track.

He was a ladies man,
you know, very charming.

I was kind of a bookworm.

We had brief interactions,
but not so much.

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,571
We lost touch for several years.

by the age of 19, but I was still working.

I was going to college
and, um, just taking care of my girls.

330
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:51,338
Because I did grow up in the inner city,
I didn't have a whole lot.

So I wanted to provide
a better life for my daughters.

00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,393
I was doing pretty well for myself.

335
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,645
Then one day…

336
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,563
[chimes]

337
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,400
[Shareza] Dorian reached out to me
on Facebook.

338
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,362
"When you have a minute, put me in it."

339
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,866
At this point, I'm in Florida.

340
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,242
He lived in Atlanta.

341
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,204
He was working at Emory Hospital

342
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,165
as a medical doctor.

343
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,751
I was very impressed.

344
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
You know, Black man doing his thing,

345
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,717
you know, very proud of the man
that he has become from high school.

346
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:42,014
I had a business trip.
It was going to be in Atlanta, Georgia.

347
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,224
And I was like, "Oh, Dorian lives there."

348
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,563
I reached out, and I said,
"Hey, maybe we can have lunch?"

349
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,690
And he was like, "Oh, sure."

350
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,321
The first date, you know,
I was very nervous.

351
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,741
He picked me up
in this nice Bentley coupe.

352
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,659
He had on his medical scrubs,

353
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,287
and he told me,
"Hey, I have to go back and change."

354
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,581
So we went back to his loft,

355
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,916
a beautiful…

356
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,836
I think he was on the 21st floor,
which is very, you know, very nice.

357
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,007
And then we just went out on the town.

358
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,012
He seemed to be very into me
as far as asking questions,

359
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,599
very interested in, you know,
my life and things that I did.

360
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,689
I had a great time.
He was over-the-top romantic,

361
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,151
made me feel like a princess,
a queen that night.

362
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,321
This is someone who matches your drive.

363
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,116
This person is, you know,
everything that I would want.

364
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,993
[tense music plays]

365
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,166
I've never, ever had a case
where I'm meeting up with the victim now

366
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,335
where she's actually been married to him.

367
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,547
So he's gone to that length.

368
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,968
Then you are
a true professional in the game.

369
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,054
You're a hard-working fraudster,
I have to say.

370
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,519
-[Shareza] Hi.
-[Cecilie] Hi. Cecilie.

371
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,646
-Shareza, right?
-Give you a hug? Yes, Shareza.

372
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,982
[Cecilie] Hi. So cute.

373
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,192
It's beautiful here.

374
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,653
-Is that…
-[Shareza] Those are my daughters.

375
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,863
-[Cecilie] Beautiful.
-Thank you.

376
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,742
[Cecilie] Thank you for reaching out.
I saw the video where…

377
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,743
Yeah.

378
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,203
And I was like, "Wow."

379
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,746
It's scary.

380
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,916
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-I have no idea what's going on.

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,961
-I'm hoping you can help me figure it out.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

382
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,046
So tell me about Dorian.

383
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,091
What was your impression of him back then?

384
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,010
Very, um, loving.

385
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,553
-Yes.
-[Shareza] Right?

386
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,433
I literally get flowers
three times a week.

387
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,686
It wasn't just the average dozen roses.

388
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,024
He would just go all out
with rose petals, candles,

389
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,734
and walking in on flowers.

390
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,861
There was always something.

391
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,781
Just doing things
that you see on movies and TV.

392
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
He told me I was this perfect woman,

393
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,707
wrapped up in all of the qualities
that he was attracted to.

394
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,920
So, what did your daughters think of him?

395
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
They really thought
that he was a good guy.

396
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,799
Like, their mom was happy.

397
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,761
[soft instrumental music plays]

398
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,014
[Shareza] I am definitely not someone
that falls in love easily.

399
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,016
I always said that I trust backwards.

400
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,977
Like, you start at zero
and you have to earn 100.

401
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,315
I introduced my daughters to Dorian.

402
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,485
It was a big deal for me they'd get along.

403
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,655
Neither one of their fathers
were, you know, in their lives.

404
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:52,412
I found it very difficult to find someone
who wanted to be that father figure.

405
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,749
He was very attentive.

406
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,044
You know, he seemed to be very into,

407
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,924
you know, their well-being,
and who they were as young ladies.

408
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,094
They started building
a pretty decent relationship.

409
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,347
-So you were heavily invested in--
-[Shareza] Everything. Right.

410
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,016
And your entire family
was invested in this, yeah.

411
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,519
Oh my God, this is Mr. Right.

412
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,978
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-This is the one.

413
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,230
[camera clicks]

414
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,774
[Shareza] It was off and on
for about a year,

415
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,194
and then he said
he wanted to be exclusive.

416
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,112
[camera clicks]

417
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
[Shareza] He says to me,

418
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,949
"What do you think
about me moving to Florida?"

419
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,368
"And moving in with you and the girls?"

420
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,703
I-- I was a little taken back.

421
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,414
And he said, you know,

422
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:39,626
"I need to be with, you know, someone
that really cares about me and loves me."

423
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:47,300
So he moved to Florida.
The girls were very happy about the move.

424
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,844
It was a new chapter.

425
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,765
Dorian told me
he wanted to open his own practice.

426
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,766
Here in Florida.

427
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,063
He said, "This is a dream for me.
Something I've always wanted to have."

428
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,648
And I was excited about it.

429
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,860
It felt like a new beginning
for the both of us.

430
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,903
[music ends]

431
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,655
[Cecilie] When did he first ask for money?

432
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,282
He asked me about

433
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,995
taking out a $100,000 business loan
for his own practice.

434
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,038
He said that his credit was horrible

435
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,375
from taking care of his mother
and the medical bills.

436
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,295
And I told him
I wasn't comfortable with doing that.

437
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,589
We're not even engaged.

438
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,634
Then he proposed maybe like a month after.

439
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,470
Well, that was quick.

440
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,431
-I still have the engagement video.
-[Cecilie] You do?

441
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,974
[upbeat music plays]

442
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,980
[Shareza] I was in the kitchen
just kind of cleaning up

443
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,982
because I had family over for dinner.

444
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,068
Next thing I know,

445
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,363
he comes in with flowers and balloons.

446
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,449
[women squealing]

447
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,536
[Shareza] Oh my God!

448
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,582
He had my friends and family over.

449
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,836
Dorian had even contacted my dad
asking for my hand in marriage.

450
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,299
So everybody except me knew
that he was going to propose that day.

451
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,468
Oh my God!

452
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,596
I can remember my godmom saying,

453
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,139
"Are you gonna answer?"

454
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,308
-So I finally just say yes.
-[Dorian] Yes.

455
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,310
[women squealing]

456
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:22,979
And

457
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,065
I was engaged.

458
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,026
[woman] Let me see that!

459
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,532
But I feel like
you seem in complete kind of shock.

460
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:38,828
The way he came about it was almost like
making you not be able to say no.

461
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,039
Like, I see this so often
with romance fraud.

462
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,376
Like, the victims are put under
such huge amounts of pressure.

463
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,169
Yeah, in hindsight.

464
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,672
-It's like that was very manipulative.
-Yeah.

465
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,466
[soft music plays]

466
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,428
The wedding day was very exciting.
I was nervous, of course.

467
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,225
Family and friends,
maybe about 150 to 200 guests.

468
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,978
And we just had a great time.
It was awesome.

469
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,855
This is it.
Like, now I'm building my forever.

470
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,446
[Cecilie] So let me guess, it wasn't long
before he asked for that loan again.

471
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,364
Yeah.

472
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:19,411
And then I end up
taking out a $100,000 loan

473
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,122
'cause he promised
that this would be great for our future.

474
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:28,086
So this new business was set up.
It was called the Best U Now

475
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,548
where we had cosmetic surgery procedures.

476
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,428
Being that the Best U Now
was in South Florida,

477
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,515
and I know that South Florida is,
like, the hub for cosmetic surgery,

478
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,767
I was really excited about it.

479
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,440
Dorian was over the day-to-day operation
of the business.

480
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,443
I was really just an investor.

481
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,070
I was still working
for a Fortune 500 company.

482
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,159
He would hire surgeons
that would perform tummy tucks,

483
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,703
liposuction, Brazilian butt lifts,

484
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,788
facelifts, rhinoplasty.

485
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,332
You name it, they did it.

486
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,754
But there was a lot of expenses
that came along with it.

487
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,174
Dorian said that his credit
still wasn't where it needed to be.

488
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,970
I took out a lot of loans
just to fund this business.

489
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,850
He had me put my name
jointly on everything.

490
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,898
I felt a bit overwhelmed,

491
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:35,153
but Dorian said that I would definitely
be able to get my money back.

492
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,659
I felt like I had to do that,
you know, as a wife.

493
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,036
That's what it's about, partnership.

494
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,458
When it started,
the business, it was doing well.

495
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,503
-It was, yeah?
-It seemed like it. Things were lucrative.

496
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,755
[gentle music plays]

497
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,342
[Shareza] The Best U Now became known
based off of word of mouth.

498
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,803
And it started bringing in money.

499
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,599
So I felt that
this was gonna be something great.

500
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,688
So Dorian felt
that my house was too small.

501
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,941
He had always said
he never liked townhomes.

502
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,859
And he wanted something bigger.

503
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,153
So he talked me into

504
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,824
purchasing a new home that cost $800,000.

505
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,412
It was a beautiful five-bedroom,

506
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,955
four-bathroom home.

507
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,834
Gated community,
very prestigious community.

508
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,462
I mean, it was gorgeous.
It was a dream home.

509
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,217
Because Dorian's credit
still was not where it needs to be,

510
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,554
I qualified for this home by myself.

511
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,016
I felt like
everything was falling in place.

512
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,769
We had the Best U Now clinic.

513
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,106
I had the husband.
I had beautiful daughters.

514
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,692
So this is perfect.

515
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,406
And then all of a sudden, things weren't.

516
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,616
So how did things unravel?

517
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:09,914
Um, things got bad
when the business just kind of flopped.

518
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,167
[suspenseful music plays]

519
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,837
After about a year and a half
of the Best U Now opening,

520
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,300
Dorian told me that
the landlords wanted us to pay more money.

521
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:26,431
And the Best U Now had to move
to get this new location up and running.

522
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,560
There's more money that has to be spent.

523
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,813
A lot of things started going wrong.

524
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,399
I noticed that staff
started leaving abruptly.

525
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,611
Dorian had lost surgeons.

526
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,114
Patients were coming back
with surgery horror stories.

527
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
Botched Brazilian butt lifts.

528
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,576
Lipo gone wrong.

529
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,704
The clinic was just going down.

530
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,208
There was no money coming in.

531
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,295
The debt is piling up,
and we can't afford it anymore.

532
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,841
I asked Dorian what happened
to the money that we were making.

533
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,384
What-- What's going on?

534
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,721
And he was never able
to give me a real definitive answer.

535
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,559
We're in a position
where we're literally maybe

536
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,437
two, three payrolls away
from losing it all.

537
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,566
I have so much to lose at this point.

538
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,485
I have to make this work.

539
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,696
So I took out a loan…

540
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,448
[keyboard clacking]

541
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,159
[Shareza] …for $500,000.

542
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,703
Just to get the business back afloat.

543
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,332
But now I have all this debt in my name.

544
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,168
I begin to get very worried.

545
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,589
I don't have a handle on this.

546
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,135
[Cecilie] There's something called
sunk cost fallacy,

547
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,889
which means that
the more that you put into a relationship,

548
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,643
and the further in you get,
the more difficult it is to admit

549
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,311
that something's wrong

550
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,482
'cause you've already spent
so much time, so much money.

551
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,819
Like, you go deeper and deeper into it
instead of retracting.

552
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,407
[Shareza] Eventually, the business closed.

553
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:13,830
It was close to, like, $2 million
in debt and loans that was owed,

554
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,374
that I was ultimately responsible for.

555
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,255
[soft music plays]

556
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,717
[Shareza] I wasn't sure how I wanted
to move forward at this point.

557
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,927
After the business closed,

558
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,930
once I said I wasn't taking out
any more credit in my name,

559
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,226
Dorian began behaving very irrationally.

560
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,563
We got into argument after argument.

561
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,609
Then one day, I came into his office.

562
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,737
He wasn't there,
and I just happened to look on his desk.

563
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,241
I found this text message
that he wrote to a friend

564
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,201
that basically said,

565
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,788
"She's broke.
She's not gonna use her credit,

566
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,999
so I'm basically done."

567
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,084
[music intensifies]

568
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,046
[Shareza] As I read that message,

569
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,091
my heart literally
just sunk to my stomach.

570
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,762
After five years together,
it was sickening.

571
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,016
And that's when
I decided to file for divorce.

572
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,520
[foreboding music plays]

573
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,980
[Shareza] Dorian just left.

574
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,984
And I have no idea where he's gone.

575
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,819
I'm in so much debt,

576
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,574
I filed a civil suit to try
and get at least some of my money back.

577
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:36,037
But Dorian's tactics
was to file a lawsuit against me.

578
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,376
He was basically saying that
it's my fault that the business failed.

579
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,255
He has actually filed
multiple police reports against me.

580
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,841
One of those saying that

581
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,845
I signed a check
that he didn't give me permission to.

582
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,474
Dorian was trying to silence me.

583
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,685
[Cecilie] Did you go to the police?

584
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:03,064
I went to the police,
and they said, um, this is a civil matter.

585
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,024
They didn't even take a report.

586
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:09,112
The police don't even care
to look into it, and I think that is what…

587
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,698
It-- It angers me so much.

588
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,615
Yeah.

589
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,536
-What do you need our help with?
-I need to find out everything.

590
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,329
-I wanna get to the bottom of this.
-Yeah.

591
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,415
Um, I want justice.

592
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,547
[Brianne] Hey, girl.

593
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,007
-Hi.
-[Brianne] Hi.

594
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,425
Good to see you.

595
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,428
[Brianne] Good to see you too.
So where do we go from here?

596
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,722
The case is insane.

597
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,723
[curious music plays]

598
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,518
[Cecilie] Shareza claims
he was asking her to co-sign for loans,

599
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,147
making her legally responsible
for the debt.

600
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,773
And now he's disappeared.

601
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,361
So the ultimate goal
with this investigation is

602
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,364
establishing whether or not
this dude was legitimate.

603
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,657
-Yeah.
-[Brianne] Or not.

604
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,409
Was he really in love with her,

605
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,454
or was he really trying
to take her for everything he could?

606
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,081
A common tactic among fraudsters

607
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,376
is to get the victims
to take out loans in their names.

608
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,881
That way, the victims are the ones
who are responsible for the debts.

609
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:14,594
If we can prove
that the perpetrator lied to the victim

610
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,972
in order to get these loans taken out,
that's loan fraud.

611
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,517
We need to dig up
some information on Dorian.

612
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,899
[keyboard clacking]

613
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,359
[Brianne] Look at him
with his little business suit.

614
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,573
How many businesses does this guy have?

615
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,328
I wonder why he has
so many different businesses and personas.

616
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,580
He's got, looks like,

617
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,918
the doctor lab coat
with the stethoscope around his neck.

618
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,754
And then there's another one.

619
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,216
"Dorian Wilkerson, PhD,
Statistics Professor."

620
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,427
[Cecilie] Looks like
two very different careers, you would say.

621
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,973
"Dr. Dorian Wilkerson, PhD,
Director at Body Renue."

622

-Yep, Dr. Wilkerson, Dr. Wilkerson.

with a patient laying there?

629
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,708
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

630
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,752
[Dorian] I'm actually tagging a name

631
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:34,423
that, uh, you're gonna hear me
use and, um, and post a lot.

632
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,551
That name is Dr. Body.

633
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,553
Did you hear this guy
call himself Dr. Body?

634
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,346
[sniggers] Yeah, Dr. Body.

635
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:45,101
A week from today would just give us
a pretty good, um, ideology of how…

636
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,436
Not even an ideology,
a pretty good assumption

637
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,522
of how well
her lymphatic system is draining.

638
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,942
He's trying to sound
like he knows what he's talking about.

639
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,738
But he totally sounds, like, uninformed
about what it is he's trying to explain.

640
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,698
Yeah.

641
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,994
[Dorian] Some of the things
that I wanna talk about is two words. Um…

642
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,663
Well, actually, it's one word.

643
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,789
Liposuction.

644
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,625
[Brianne] Something's not adding up
with this.

645
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,296
We need to see what information
is out there on those clinics.

646
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,389
We need to do a little digging around
on Dorian and the business itself.

647
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,642
And I think
that's a very good starting point for us

648
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,729
to work out
what's fact and what's fiction.

649
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,358
When marriage is involved,
it could complicate things.

650
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,987
You share bank accounts.
You share contracts. You share mortgages.

651
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,949
It's not as easy to separate

652
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,327
responsibilities.

653
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,789
And it's hard to isolate wrongdoing.

654
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,628
All right.

655
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:59,759
Y'all just hang there for a minute.
Might be a little weird with the cameras.

[tense music plays]

657
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,142
[Brianne] Hi, how are you?

658
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,521
Just wondering if you've heard
of a business called Best, uh, U Now.

659
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,650
-Does that name ring a bell?
-[woman] Yeah, it does.

660
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,236
That's the gentleman who was
across the street doing--

661
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,529
[Brianne] Yeah.
In that building over there, right?

662
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,032
[woman] He was a former athlete
or something.

663
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
[Brianne] Yeah.

664
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,787
[woman] That's what I heard.
So he appeared to be reputable.

665
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,249
[Brianne] Yeah. So what have you heard
about him or what do you know about him?

666
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,917
Well, we just heard

667
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,380
that there were some kind of
unscrupulous things going on over there.

668
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,090
-[Brianne ] Yeah.
-Shady stuff, yeah.

669
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,093
-[Brianne] Yeah.
-I have to say it's unusual for this area.

670
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,387
-[Brianne] Yeah? Thank you. Bye.
-Yeah.

671
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,472
[tense music plays]

672
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,185
[Brianne] Hi.

673
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,691
I was wondering about a business,
Best U Now, um, Dorian Wilkerson.

674
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,110
-I don't… Gosh, this was a while ago.
-[Brianne] Yeah.

675
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,904
I remember something
along the lines of him, like,

676
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,991
jumping out of state
because of something funky that went on.

677
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,409
-[Brianne] Oh wow.
-Yeah.

678
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,704
[Brianne] Did you remember where he went
when he left state? Do you remember?

679
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,914
[man] Georgia. I don't know
if that's where Emory is…

680
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,333
-[Brianne] Oh!
-[man] Where he graduated from med school.

681
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,211
-That's the only thing I remember.
-[Brianne] Possibly going to Georgia.

682
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,422
-Maybe. I don't know.
-[Brianne] Potentially.

683
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,633
Thank you so much for your time, okay?
All right, bye.

684
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,888
It seems like Dorian
has jumped state lines with this.

685
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,518
He used to work at Emory Hospital.
Maybe he's gone back there.

686
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,895
I've gotta get to Atlanta.

687
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,899
[music fades]

688
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,863
[Cecilie] We are now headed
to see Shareza's daughters.

689
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,908
I have tons of questions
about how their life with Dorian was.

690
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,246
How involved were they in the business?
What did they know about it?

691
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,498
What has been the aftermath?

692
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,547
-Hi, Cecilie. Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Nykki. Thank you.

693
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,673
[Cecilie] Sit down.

694
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,051
Thank you for meeting up with me.

695
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,635
-[woman] No problem.
-[Nykki] Of course.

696
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,555
Yeah, as you know,
we've been speaking to your mom.

697
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,057
-[Nykki] Yes.
-[Cecilie] Um.

698
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,560
I don't know how much she's told you,
but we're doing an investigation.

699
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,439
You know, I can imagine
what you guys have been through…

700
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,482
-Yeah.
-…as well.

701
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,234
So how close were you guys to Dorian?

702
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,611
We were pretty close.

703
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,654
[soft lively music plays]

704
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:31,118
[Nykki] We pushed the family narrative.
If someone referred to us as his stepkids…

705
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,119
[Cecilie] Oh.

706
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,704
Oh, he's going off, like,

707
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,540
"Who gives you the right to call?
These are my daughters."

708
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,086
[Nykki] The little girl in me
appreciated it.

709
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,091
[Jynah] It was undeniable
that when you would see all four of us,

710
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,425
we were in a family.

711
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,970
-There was no one I've ever called dad.
-Dad.

712
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,932
'Cause my biological father,
I never got a chance to meet him.

713
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,851
-It did make you feel special in a sense.
-Yeah.

714
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,020
Thinking back,
and that's one thing I grieve.

715
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:02,149
That family unit
that I was so proud to be a part.

716
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,610
-We changed our last name legally.
-Oh wow.

717
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,446
[Shareza] We are the Wilkersons!

718
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,910
[Nykki] And we framed it and everything.

719
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,579
That's something
that kind of makes me tear up because

720
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:21,001
when we made that decision to do that,
that came from, like, our soul.

721
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,754
-And he cried, he bawled to the point…
-[Jynah] He bawled.

722
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,049
[Nykki] My granddad held him.
He bawled. They were both crying.

723
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,222
[Cecilie] Did you guys know
that your mom was taking up loans?

724
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,183
We didn't know exactly
what was going on behind the scenes.

725
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,894
[Nykki] That's all we knew
as far as my mom's involvement,

726
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,690
was pushing his narrative and helping
his business get off the ground.

727
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,985
What did you know about, like, him
as a doctor and what did he say?

728
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,820
Yeah. Okay, so they called him Doc-Doc.

729
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,488
-Yeah.
-Why'd they call him Doc-Doc?

730
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,407
-Because he was a double doctor.
-Doctor.

731
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,910
He was a medical doctor
and a PhD, hence the Doc-Doc.

732
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,412
When you say "they." Who were they?

733
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,622
-That's how he introduced himself.
-So, he said it?

734
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,624
[Nykki] He said that.
That was his Facebook name.

735
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,712
"I'm Dorian. You can call me Doc-Doc.
Doc for short." Everyone called him Doc.

736
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,256
You didn't say the doctor,
it was a problem.

737
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:13,512
[Nykki] Now we're starting to learn
that we were living with a stranger…

738
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,306
-…this whole time.
-[Jynah] Whole time.

739
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,643
How have you seen
this whole situation affect your mom?

740
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,063
It was unbearable at a point.
The hurt I felt and we felt,

741
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,816
I know my mom feels that times a thousand.

742
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,903
I never want another woman
to feel this ever again.

743
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,615
And just to think about us now,
us growing up as young women.

744
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,576
-You think about love a different way.
-Yeah.

745
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,912
A completely different way, because…

746
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,415
To know that you were in love
with somebody who was just using you.

747
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,125
-That hurts.
-[Nykki] That hurts bad.

748
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,335
Like, how do you do that?

749
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,794
-It's crazy.
-Yeah.

750
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:50,049
I'm just happy we still have her mentally,
'cause that can take a toll on somebody.

751
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,676
Especially, like, you know, being in love,

752
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,928
being defrauded.

753
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,972
So to still have her
being the strong woman that she is…

754
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,434
If she can do it,
it kind of gives me hope.

755
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,938
[tense music plays]

756
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,235
[Cecilie] What he's done to this family
is just unforgivable.

757
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,572
They thought they had a father figure,
like what a lot of teenage girls

758
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,282
you know, would want, you know.

759
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,910
It's like he's coming in,
making their mom happy.

760
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,914
Like, "I'm here, we have a future,
we're a proper family unit now."

761
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,709
But it isn't just only one victim,
it's a ripple effect.

762
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,753
It's a huge devastation.

763
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,840
For the people around.
They changed their fucking last name.

764
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,425
And this is what he does?

765
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,805
[music intensifies]

766
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,398
[Brianne] I do not come to Atlanta often,

767
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,694
so… I'm just trying
to navigate these streets.

768
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,865
Dorian told Shareza
that he worked for Emory Hospital.

769
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,703
So, I'm just gonna go to Emory
and see if there's a personnel office,

770
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,912
human resources,

771
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,748
someone who would be
willing to talk to me.

772
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,625
And see if any of that's true.

773
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,047
[background chatter]

774
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,635
[Brianne] I need to verify, like,
an employment status.

775
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,221
I'm a licensed private investigator.

776
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,639
How do I do that here?

777
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,892
-[woman] Let's find a private space.
-[Brianne] Yeah. Let me grab my stuff.

778
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,810
Perfect.

779
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,646
[female] What is this person's name?

780
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,775
[Brianne] His name is Dorian Wilkerson.

781
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,865
[Shareza] When we were
just getting to know one another,

782
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,784
Dorian told me that
he was working at Emory Hospital,

783
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,621
and he was an emergency room doctor.

784
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,124
And when I would go to Atlanta
for a visit,

785
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,461
Dorian would go out to work
at about 10:30 p.m.

786
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,921
and get home at 7:30 a.m.

787
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,966
He had on his medical scrubs,

788
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,554
looked very studious
and very, you know, attractive.

789
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,015
He was very impressive.

790
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,352
At one point

791
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:11,023
Dorian said that President Obama
came to Emory Hospital,

792
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,860
and he just went down the line
shaking their hands.

793
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,945
He was like, "Good job, Doc."

794
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,491
And I was like, "Oh wow."
I said, "That's awesome."

795
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,453
[Brianne] Thank you so much.
I appreciate it. Y'all have a good day.

796
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,830
[line ringing]

797
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,167
-[Brianne sighs]
-[line continues ringing]

798
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,335
[Brianne] All right.

799
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,753
[Cecilie] Hi, Bri.

800
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,129
Hey, Cecilie. So…

801
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,839
I'm at Emory Hospital.

802
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,966
-And guess what I found out.
-What?

803
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,135
So, I got someone to give me information.

804
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:44,098
And turns out they don't have
a record of him at all in their database.

805
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:46,767
[sighs]

806
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,146
These people have never heard
of Dorian Wilkerson at Emory.

807
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,441
Fuck. This is big.

808
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,526
[Brianne] It's huge.

809
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,195
All right. Well, I just wanted
to give you a brief update on that.

810
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,155
-[Cecilie] Sure.
-[Brianne] Okay, bye.

811
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,866
It's not looking good for Dorian.

812
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,081
So Dorian is claiming to be a doctor,

813
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,418
and I wanna dig up
some information into his credentials.

814
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:18,424
[Shareza] When Dorian and I first met,
he seemed very compassionate,

815
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,843
that he wanted to help people,
no matter what.

816
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,430
But after a while,

817
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,433
it really just started changing.

818
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,728
Search.

819
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,980
[Brianne] No records found.

820
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,816
[Shareza] We got into
argument after argument.

821
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:40,195
He became more distant
and just basically disappeared.

822
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,824
Here's something
from the Department of Health.

823
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,492
Oh, this sounds serious.

824
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,622
They issued this guy a cease and desist.

825
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,668
They said that he is not licensed

826
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,796
by the department
or the board of medicine,

827
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,590
and is practicing medicine

828
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,051
and leading the public to believe
