00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,190
[Cecilie] If FBI is on it,
that's a big deal.

00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,900
Yeah, huge deal.

4
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,529
They were investigating her
for some extremely serious fraud.

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,409
They had tracked about $600,000

6
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:38,872
in fraudulent funds
from eight to ten victims.

7
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,584
She pled guilty.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,423
Part of her plea agreement meant
that she had to admit

9
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,675
to all the things that she had lied about.

I found out that she never worked
for the Gates Foundation.

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,768
She had barely gone to any college,

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,896
let alone graduated
from the University of Washington.

14
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,775
She read me like a book.

15
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,321
She figured out exactly the combinations

00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,700
of fancy degrees and impressive accolades

17
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,704
that would get
someone like me to fall for her.

00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,999
But that wasn't even the half of it.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,628
She did not have MS, ever.

[dramatic music plays]

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,552
[Aaron] She had created fraudulent
documents saying that she had MS.

22
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,891
And that was the lie
she kept using for years afterward

23
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,104
'cause that was the lie she invested in,
that she had spread to everyone,

24
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,774
and that she had
based her entire scheme on.

And now the story was all over the news.

28
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,415

was completely fraudulent.

She picked MS
'cause that's what killed my dad's dad.

I never went to any doctor's appointments
with her, and I really, really wish I had.

You know, the appointments were always

She ended up doing some pretty serious
jail time for a first-time offender.

Wow, how long was she in prison for?

38

About 18 months, I believe.

00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,455
At the sentencing hearing,

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,001
I finally got to hear
where a lot of that money went.

41
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,340
She was essentially
using everyone else's money

42
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,343
to live like
she was on vacation every day.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,183
It felt like
the bizarre sense of camaraderie,

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,395
knowing that there were
a bunch of other people out there

45
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,857
that also had been ripped off by Sabrina.

to get some more money.

The grand total ended up being
right around $100,000.

I'm so sorry, Aaron,
that you had to experience this.

As part of her plea agreement,
she has to make an effort

to pay everyone back
over the next few years,

why I wanted to talk to you guys.

They were together for six years.

-What? She lied about that?
-[Cecilie] Yes.

Unfortunately, he never got justice.

He didn't know he was being defrauded
until years later,

85
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,532
so he never went to police at the time.

Most romance scammers are men,

to get him to do what she wanted.

and frustrated, and scared."

who was able to convict Sabrina.

123
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,684
A perfect outcome for this meeting

Thank you so much for agreeing
to meet with me. I really appreciate it.

129
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:19,081
What made this case special
in that it was taken on by the FBI?

130
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,584
Wire fraud, which is
what she was charged with,

131
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,587
is sending a lie
via an email or a text message.

132
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,714
Um, you know, wires cross state lines,

133
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,218
so that would give us jurisdiction
to investigate this.

134
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,554
For some of the victims,
we had years' worth of text messages

135
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,434
where you could see in plain sight
the lies that she was telling,

136
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,396
and then people agreeing
to give her money based on those lies.

137
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,108
So why wasn't Aaron's case
picked up by the FBI?

138
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,488
Problem with Aaron's case
is how old the activity was.

139
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,115
-Okay.
-There's a statute of limitations.

140
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,368
Um, for wire fraud, it's five years.

141
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,872
If the fraud isn't charged
within that five-year period,

142
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,916
we can't charge that anymore.

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,632
He had no idea
he was being defrauded until years later.

144
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,385
Very complicated,
especially with personal relationships.

145
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:17,306
It's unfortunate that, uh, we can't help
everybody get some recovery or justice.

146
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,433
[Brianne] The immediate solution

147
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:24,272
would be to educate people on what to do
if they think they are being defrauded,

148
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,818
and what signs to look for so that
they can avoid it being too late for them.

-…to bring cases like this to justice.

00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,078

that law enforcement has not caught up

don't come to light often for years.

in such a short time frame.

156

This is why we need more victims
to speak out and come forward

will understand what this crime is.

00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,134
Unfortunately, according to the FBI,

168
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,595
you're outside
of the statute of limitations

169
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,764
for them to do anything else with it.

170
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,433
-Right. Thank you.
-[Brianne] I'm so sorry, Aaron.

171
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,938
How can I make a claim if I don't have
the evidence to make the claim?

172
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,943
I appreciate why the statute
of limitations as a concept exists.

173
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,573
And at the same time, I didn't know
I was being defrauded 'cause…

174
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,409
I literally thought she had MS.

175
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,914
I really didn't know for absolute certain
until the case came out.

-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-'Cause things need to change.

177
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,878
The way the laws are,
they don't protect the victims.

They enable the perpetrators.

-Yeah.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

180
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,885
The reason why I'm doing what I'm doing
is to actually create that change.

181
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,389
And the only way that change will happen

182
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:26,560
is if people like you
come forward and bring attention,

183
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,106
and people like us stand behind you
to help you amplify your voice.

00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,274
-[Aaron] Thank you.
-I know how it is.

And how much it takes
to go public in telling your story,

186
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,238
uh, 'cause you never know

187
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,824
what kind of reception,
what will come out from it.

188
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,119
But I really, really can say
from the bottom of my heart

189
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,122
that it's been a big part
of my healing process.

190
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,124
Thank you for saying that.

191
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,212
And I hope that this maybe have helped you
get a sense of closure in this case.

192
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,714
-[Aaron] It really has.
-Yeah.

193
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,966
I'm not gonna let this define me,

194
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,553
and I'm not gonna let her be
the most important part of my life again.

195
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,888
Thank you, Aaron, for doing this.

-[Aaron] Thank you.

198
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,228
Definitely a pleasure meeting you.

199
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,107
[Cecilie] What I learned is that sometimes
justice doesn't look like a courtroom.

200
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,360
It's about reclaiming your voice.
It's about speaking up,

201
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,904
and telling the truth
even though it's hard.

202
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,157
And being listened to and believed

203
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,785
can bring a form of closure
that no legal process ever could.

[Aaron] It was definitely hard
to share my story at first,

206
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,711
but I can't even begin to tell you
how much better life is today.

207

Hi, my name's Lindsay.

215
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,225
I was dating a man,

216
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,019
Christopher Lloyd.

217
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,979
I trusted him.

218
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,983
I gave him over $140,000.

219
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,902

He not only took my money,
but he took my life.

222
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,916
I need help to hold him accountable
for what he's done.

223
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,335
It's time for him to be stopped.

224
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,554
It's heartbreaking.

225
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
She seems super defeated.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,771
She seems very tired,
and I know that feeling.

00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,942

how things got so bad for her

228
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,944

When I first moved to San Diego,
I had never even been here before.

233
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,338
So I was single for a while, you know,
just dating, trying to meet people.

234
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,216
It was hard

I would say,
I was dating more intentionally,

236
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:52,224
trying to actually meet someone
that just makes you feel safe.

237
00:14:53,601 --> 00:15:00,065

that I wasn't looking for casual things,

making sure you're single, not attached.

239
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,699
I don't want there to be any surprises.
When we meet, you know exactly who I am.

00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,160
You know exactly what I'm looking for.

241
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,704
So you try to put that out there, like,

Looks cute, handsome, very attractive.

246

We just started talking, like,
on a regular basis, like daily.

247
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,108
He used to be a pro for the LA Dodgers.

248
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,446
There were videos of him online,
and I was impressed.

249
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,703
But since then, he had retired
and made a ton of money,

250
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,207
and he used that to start
a whole new career as a financial manager.

251
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,587
He told me he was a full-time dad.

I think family values
are extremely important.

253

I'm very close with my family.

254
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,178
So to be able to be, like, present
like that for your kid,

and he lived more in the Long Beach area,
an hour and 20 minutes away,

which isn't, like, terribly far.

I was, like, really excited for us
to, like, finally meet in person.

He was very confident,
and we had chemistry.

I mean, like, we'd had
so many conversations before,

It was very easy, very flowing.

I remember him saying, "People always
ask me why I don't have, like, a house,

284
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,355
in, like, the Hollywood Hills
or something."

"I could be living a more extravagant life
but I'm a very low-key person."

I liked that. I like humble.

00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,367
I remember he paid with,
like, a huge wad of cash,

288
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,080
and he left them, like, a crazy tip.
It was, like, $80 or something.

289
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,045
And then, like, finally, like,
we hugged and, like, kissed

for, like, the first time,
like, passionately, like, romantically.

of, like, "How was your day?"

and how she died.

about my day and how I was feeling.

It was nice to feel like, you know,
someone really cared.

Being the oldest of three kids,

316
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,608
he knew how important it was to me
to be able to help my siblings

317
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,401
because we didn't have our mom anymore.

318

I feel like taking on that role,

especially if it came to money.

320
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,035

he knew tons about investment.

I received my mom's 401K when she died,

325
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:26,266

about, like, "Oh, a 401K is not for you."

"That's not where you want
your money to be. It's a waste."

"I wanna help you better your life
and your family's life."

330
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,905
Like, he would say that.

331
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,699
"And use your mom's money
for something good."

332
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,535
-Did he say that?
-Oh, a hundred percent.

333
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,872
So he mentioned,
"You should invest with my firm."

334
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,541
"We represent this company
called Planet 13."

335
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,127
"It's looking for, like, angel investors."

336
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,671
[curious music plays]

337
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,631
[Lindsay] So at first, I was like, "Meh."

338
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,051
Like, not really sounds like
what I want to do with my money.

339
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,804
And then he brought it up again
in the sense of, like,

340
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:09,268
"Well, you know, they give a 10% payout."
And I was like, "Whoa. Are you serious?"

341
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,229
He was like, "Yeah. The more you invest,
the more you get back."

342
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,608
He said there would be a contract
to help me get my money back

343
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,652
if there was ever a problem.

344
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,282
The agreement was
that I would give him $140K,

345
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,911
and every two months,
I'd just be getting a check for $20,000.

346
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,622
It's a high, you know,

347
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,792
residual payout that you would be getting
for passive income.

348
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,088
He told me after two years,
I'd be making a lot of money.

349
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,509
His mom was invested
with the same company.

350
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,179
So he, like, really, like,
made me feel safe in the investment.

351
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,307
Like, it's risky, but not really.

352
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,392
[soft instrumental music plays]

353
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,519
[chimes]

354
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,148
[Lindsay] We had been talking
consistently every day,

355
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,150
and we had chemistry.

356
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,905
I was really just focused on, like, us,
and, like, building our connection

357
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,575
and whatever business connection
also was happening.

358
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,661
It was, like, two and one
simultaneously happening,

359
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,872
romantic and business.

360
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,374
And he would always say things like,

361
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,585
"You don't have to do this
to have me in your life.

362
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,670
I just simply wanna do it to help you."

363
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:20,922
[chimes]

364
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,386
[Lindsay] I just, you know, thought, like,
"Why do you care so much about my future?"

365
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,142
He would start talking about, like,
"Oh, when you start getting money,

366
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,853
we could take trips
and you can take more time off,

367
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,105
and we can spend more time together."

368
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,232
So I trusted him,

369
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,652
'cause you want us to have a future,
which is really nice.

370
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,825
[Cecilie] Fraudsters often create
the illusion of a shared future.

371
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,080
For me,
it's the ultimate romantic gesture.

372
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,583
"We can be a team and look at what
we're gonna do in the future together."

373
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,628
You're with someone
who wants to make you better.

374
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,382
They know that you might have some money,
and they just want you to grow.

375
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,052
But in reality, it's a calculated move,

376
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,805
designed to earn your trust
and lower your guard.

377
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,265
[curious music plays]

378
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,936
[Lindsay] So I signed my contracts
with him in the beginning of May.

379
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,399
Like, I remember having a call
with my financial advisor,

380
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,736
told her that I wanted to take
the whole entire 401K out.

381
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,863
She was, "I would advise you
not to take all of it."

382
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,741
And I said, "If I'm going to invest,
I wanna make the most out of it."

383
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,785
She's like, "Are you sure?"
And I said, "Yes."

384
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,454
And she said, "Okay.
It's just gonna take some time."

385
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,248
"I have to sell off your stocks."

386
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,543
And it might take a few days,
but, you know, we'll get it done for you."

387
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,461
I remember telling Chris.

388
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,589
He was, you know, stressing out
and stressing me out a little bit.

389
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,342
Like, "We really need
to get, like, something in your account

390
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,969
because they'll close it."

391
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,933
And the money
was taking a little time to come through.

392
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,770
So then he said to me,
"Okay, well, I'll, like, fund it for you."

393
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,688
[chimes]

394
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,400
[Lindsay] I am, like,
a beyond-loyal person.

395
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,903
And so, you know, my whole thing was like,

396
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,531
"Not only are you helping me
with this, like, investment,

397
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,744
but, like, also now you're giving me
this money to fund my account, and…"

398
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
Like, "How could I ever repay you?"
essentially.

399
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,333
So, sure enough, like,
the money comes through a week later.

400
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:25,839
So I wire him the money,
and then it went to his account, direct.

401
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,883
[keyboard clacking]

402
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,676
[Lindsay] $140,000.

403
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,136
Yeah.

404
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,722
-Oh, that's a lot of money.
-[Lindsay] Yeah. It's a lot of money.

405
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,599
[soft music plays]

406
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,938
[Lindsay] One morning, he decided
to come down before I went to work.

407
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,152
It was July 12th,
and time for my first payment.

408
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,114
And that's when he was in his Lexus.

409
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,201
And I remember him
doing, like, this kind of, like,

410
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,953
jumping out of the car, like, excited.

411
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,080
And he was like, "I love payday."

412
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,001
And he gave me a check,
and it was for $20,000.

413
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,921
I was, like, super excited.

414
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,590
I'm like,
"It went through. Like, this is legit."

415
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,009
"Like, I got my money.
Like, great. Amazing."

416
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,223
I was feeling like
life is really about to change for me.

417
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,978
So, basically, after I did the investment,

418
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,148
things kind of started to, like, fizzle.

419
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,025
[tense music plays]

420
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,945
[Lindsay] We stopped talking
as much, and, like,

421
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,532
he wasn't making as much of an effort
to try to come see me.

422
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,992
And I'm like, "Okay, like, what the heck?"

423
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,163
So I messaged him,
and I was like, "Hey,

424
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:44,251
I think that maybe it's better off that
we just have a business relationship

425
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,420
and, like, maybe not do
the romantic part anymore."

426
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,007
So after that, our romantic relationship
was, like, officially, like, done.

427
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:52,968
[chimes]

428
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,225
[Lindsay] Come September,
I was supposed to get my second check.

429
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:05,146
And he's telling me about
this family member that's very ill,

430
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,442
and how he might not
be able to meet me to pay me,

431
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,195
and asked me to set up a PayPal account

432
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,366
so that he could start sending me
my payments in, like, smaller increments.

433
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,909
[foreboding music plays]

434
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,996
[Lindsay] But then he's like,
"I'm having issues with PayPal."

435
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,667
And then from then on,
it was just a complete shit show.

436
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:31,172
Just, like, became, like, this, like,
months and months of, like,

437
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,009
redoing my account
and having to open a new account,

438
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,178
and signing new paperwork
for a year straight.

439
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,349
It just became this whole long,
drawn-out process of not paying me.

440
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,278
I really started to spiral.
I was like, "Why can I only talk to you?"

441
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,323
"Why can't I talk to your boss
or someone else?"

442
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,992
At one point, he said to me,

443
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,621
if I told people, it would just be
more toxic for my mental health

444
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,916
because they wouldn't believe me
or think I was stupid.

445
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,044
So there was eight months

446
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,796
of not speaking to anyone
about what I was dealing with

447
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,008
and just keeping it all to myself.
I didn't tell a single soul.

448
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,135
No one knew.

449
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,096
[Cecilie] Control and isolation

450
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,141
are the silent weapons
in these kind of relationships.

451
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:27,729
If you lost all your money
to this individual, what are you gonna do?

452
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,856
That's the only individual
that can help you.

453
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,234
So it's very isolating
which is exactly what they want.

454
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,619
At this point, I am, like,
in a terrible, like, mental state.

455
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,790
I don't know what's real, what to believe.

456
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,335
And I realized
I wasn't gonna get my money back.

457
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,630
I knew I had to go to the police.

458
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,423
[curious music plays]

459
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,052
[Lindsay] Those are the contracts
that I signed.

460
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,514
I drove
to the Fullerton Police Department,

461
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,973
and they turned me away.

462
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,560
-[Cecilie] On what grounds?
-Um, I gave him my money.

463
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,813
They said that to you? You gave it away.

464
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:15,235
I walked into the police station
with all of this and nothing.

465
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:19,364
-I wouldn't just give away $140,000.
-[Cecilie] No, that is--

466
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,033
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Lindsay] He stole it.

467
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,911
You are dealing with the consequences.
What about him?

468
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,747
Is he dealing with any consequences?
You know, they never do.

469
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,209
That is lighting the anger inside of me
'cause it's just not fucking fair.

470
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,378
It's been a year
since I actually saw him in person,

471
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,296
and that's when he gave me my check.

472
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,592
I need to get my money back.
Like, how am I gonna get my money?

473
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,554
Yeah. I promise you,
we'll do our very best.

474
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,558
[line ringing]

475
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,981
-[Brianne] Hey, Cecilie.
-I have just met up with Lindsay.

476
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,568
-Okay.
-She's lost an incredible amount of money

477
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,696
in an investment romance scam.

478
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,031
Over $140,000.

479
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,491
Oh my God.

480
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,996
Do we have anything we can at least
sink our teeth into with this one?

481
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,997
[Cecilie] Yeah.

482
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,876
Lindsay has been amazing
at actually providing contracts.

483
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,463
Chris said he was linked to a company
called Landmark Associates.

484
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:21,593
The company that she would "supposedly"
have invested in called Planet 13.

485
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:25,263
[Brianne] Okay.
So we need to find out if he lied to her

486
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,182
to get her to make these investments.

487
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,518
I'm gonna start by digging into this guy.

[tense music plays]

489
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:38,860
[Brianne] Early on in the investigation,
it's important to deep dive into the case

490
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,948
to get all the information
that's readily available to you,

491
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,870
whether that's through record searches,
database searches.

492
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,998
You start to collect intel

493
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:57,462
about the perpetrator
and figure out who they really are.

494
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,228
-[Cecilie] What did you find?
-[Brianne] Well.

495
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,980
He had a restraining order
put out against him

496
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,775
from someone named Lauren in Arizona.

497
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,486
[tense music continues]

498
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,740
He had to have been doing
something terrible to her

499
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,243
for her to want
to get this restraining order against him.

500
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,287
So we need to talk
to whoever this Lauren person is.

501
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,456
Could she be another victim?

502
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,292
[Cecilie] I'll see if I can find her.

503

[keyboard clacking]

504
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,675
[Brianne] It's up to us

505
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,554
to prove that
they have defrauded other people.

506
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,682
That it's not a one-time occurrence.

507
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,645
There is a pattern of behavior
that the police need to consider.

[music intensifies]

510
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,872
[Cecilie] So Lauren got back to me
on LinkedIn, which is great.

511
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,209
She's the one who had
the restraining order against Chris,

512
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,547
and I'm just so curious
to hear what happened to her.

513
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,595
A restraining order is a serious charge.

514
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,557
It's not something
the courts grant lightly.

515
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,561
There must have been enough evidence
to believe that Chris posed a real threat.

516
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,567
The question is, what did he do to her?
