-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Lauren. Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,484
[Cecilie] Thank you so much
for speaking to me

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,487
because we found you through
the restraining order that you filed,

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,366
so I'm, like, really curious, like,
what was your relationship to Chris?

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,620
So, I was in a romantic relationship
with him, and I was defrauded.

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,538
Yeah.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:45,253
I've had some bad relationships before,
but nothing to this magnitude.

10
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:52,385
By the end of it, I was terrified because
I have no idea who this person was.

[tense music plays]

12
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,477
So how did you guys meet?

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,813
We connected on Instagram.
So that's kind of where it all started.

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,232
-Did he reach out on Instagram or did it--
-Yes. Yeah.

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,195
He had a lot of pictures of him
just being very active,

16
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:15,158
and I probably talked to him
maybe two, three months on Instagram.

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,037
He said he was an ex-baseball player
for the LA Dodgers.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,497
And I was very impressed with that.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,124
So after two or three months
of just chatting,

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,793
he actually came to visit me,

21
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,462
because he lived in California,
and I lived in Arizona.

[quirky music plays]

23
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,884
[Lauren] The first time I saw him,
I remember thinking he was really tall,

24
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,179
he was really in shape,
and he dressed well.

25
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:41,851
And he just had this charisma about him
where he just carried himself really well.

26
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,731
We spent the whole weekend together,
and it was great.

27
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,526
It was exactly
who I was texting and talking to.

28
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,652
He was attentive.

29
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,073
He opened the car door for me,
opened the restaurant door for me.

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,161
Just the Southern gentleman that
I really saw myself settling down with.

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,917
After that first trip, he texted me
and asked me to be his girlfriend.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,587
At the time, I thought
that was just really romantic and sweet.

33
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,216
I said, "Let's give this a try. Why not?
What's the worst that could happen?"

I just immediately just felt like
he was somebody I had been looking for.

36
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,436
Like, he was just so charismatic,
and persuasive, and intelligent.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,398
Over the course of three months,
he came to visit me four or five times.

[Lauren] I was quite impressed by him.

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,660
He had several years
of being a professional baseball player.

42
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,706
We had a deep friendship.

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,722
[Lauren] One day,
when he came to visit me,

48
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,267
he was complaining
about his accounts being frozen.

49
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,603
It was frozen due to fraud.

50
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,939
I've had fraud happen
several times in my life,

51
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,027
and I've had cards freeze randomly
and didn't think anything of it.

52
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,573
He would go on and on and complain,
"I don't know what I'm going to do."

"I've never been in this position."

"And my rent is past due
because of this account-freezing issue."

55
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,210
I lent him money.

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:35,131
It was little by little,
$800 here, $1,200 there.

57
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:41,554
At the time, I just thought it was just
a great guy that was down on his luck,

59

I said, "Once your accounts are unfrozen,
are you able to pay me everything?"

60
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,395
And he said, "It's not a big deal."

and his responses were just,

tens of thousands of dollars.

I believe he was using my laptop
when I wasn't around,

94
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:44,469
and he was logging on to my online banking
and requesting cash advances.

And as soon as the cash advances
were available in my account,

he was transferring them to his account.

and that's when he lost it.

extremely irate and angry with me.

Very charming to be around.

168
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,933
[Cecilie] Yeah, I've seen videos of him.
He looks good.

169
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,979
The London Rippers
is an independent baseball team.

170
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,608
The lowest rung from Major League
Baseball, let's just say that.

171
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:13,654
He says that he played then
for the Dodgers in the Major League.

172
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,490
-Do you know anything about that?
-That's not true.

173
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,076
-Whoa.
-He played probably 20 games with us.

174
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,620
-Thirteen at bats.
-[Cecilie] Mm.

175
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,496
[Jim] And that's the only experience

176
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,541
that I've known him
to have in professional baseball.

177
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,961
I'm always, you know,
looking at old teammates,

178
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,339
trying to figure out
what they're doing for work.

179
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,383
I only know maybe five or six guys
that made it to the big leagues.

180
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,302
-Out of all the years that I played.
-Whoa.

181
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,723
Chris has been accused of defrauding
two women out of more than $100,000.

182
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,517
You know, it's actually baffling to me.

183
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,562
From what I can remember,
he was just a very likable guy.

184
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,733
But baseball guys in general,
there's a big ego about them.

185
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,861
They all have the same goal, right?
To make it to the big leagues.

186
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,948
All that sacrifice for 20-something years,
and then not reaching the ultimate goal,

187
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,326
it's pretty…
pretty detrimental for somebody.

188
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,411
[gentle music plays]

189
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,872
[Cecilie] We have proven that

190
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,750
he never played
for any major league baseball.

191
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,460
He never played for the Dodgers.

192
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,631
And maybe that's why he was
targeting women outside of LA.

193
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,595
Even though you felt you failed in life

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,598
and you didn't get the life
that you feel like you deserve,

195
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,934
it's not okay
to destroy other people's lives.

196
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,146
Even for Jim, he thought
that Chris was just a friendly guy.

197
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,273
But this is how they are.

198
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,652
These fraudsters, they are likable people.

199
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,445
That's why they're dangerous.

200
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,414
[tense music plays]

201
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,293
[Brianne] We know Chris lied about
being a major league baseball player.

202
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,798
But the way he got money from Lindsay
was through investments.

203
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,302
First, I need to establish

204
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,972
whether Chris Lloyd is
a licensed investment broker

205
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,432
in the state of California.

206
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:11,772
If he is, he should be listed
in the FINRA regulatory agency search.

207
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,524
Let's see if he is.

208
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,527
[Lindsay] He knew tons about banking,

209
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,241
money, credit, loans,
just all sorts of financial knowledge.

210
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,411
Made me feel safe in the investment.

211
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,580
[Brianne] No results.

212
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,001
But maybe he was working independently.

213
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,255
Chris told Lindsay

214
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,718
that he had investment opportunities
for her through Planet 13.

215
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,264
They're an established company,

216
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,058
one of the biggest weed dispensaries
in the US.

217
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,690
But he told Lindsay her check
would be sent from Landmark Associates.

218
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,151
So that's who we need to look into.

219
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:01,614
When he was supposed to pay me,
I asked, "Where's this check coming from?"

220
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,949
And he said, "Landmark Associates."

221
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,202
[Brianne] All right,
so let's call Landmark.

222
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,624
[sighs] No one's available
to take my call.

223
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,001
I couldn't find an email address
on their website.

224
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,711
That doesn't sound right.

225
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,922
I'll definitely have
to dig a bit deeper with this.

226
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,548
This is not making sense.

227
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
[dramatic music plays]

228
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,224
[Brianne] Oh, this is interesting.

229
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,313
A civil lawsuit filed
by a female plaintiff

230
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,400
against both Chris Lloyd
and the Landmark Associates.

231
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,903
The allegation? Fraud.

232
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,241
[intriguing music plays]

233
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:50,496
[Brianne] Hey, Cee, I found a civil suit
of a woman suing Chris for fraud.

234
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,501
She doesn't wanna be identified,
but her lawyer has agreed to meet with me.

235
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,418
Scott?

236
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,754
-Hi, Brianne Joseph, private investigator.
-Scott.

237
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
Nice to meet you.

238
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,219
My partner, Cecilie, and I
are investigating Christopher Lloyd,

239
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,347
and, um, I understand you have
a court case open with him.

240
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,849
Absolutely correct.

241
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,685
So my client knew Christopher Lloyd.

242
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,771
-I believe they met on a dating website.
-[Brianne] Okay.

243
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,440
[Scott] He represented
that he was a broker.

244
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,694
He could take money,
invest it, and give high returns

245
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,823
at a business organization
he called Landmark Associates.

246
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,659
It's funny you mention Landmark

248
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,203
because I've been trying
to get in touch with Landmark.

249
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,164
Do you think it's a legitimate company?
Are they closed? Open?

250
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,541
What do you know about Landmark?

251
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,045
Christopher Lloyd is
a bad person in so many ways.

252
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,089
-[Brianne] Yeah.
-But he can be clever, right?

253
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,757
You can google Landmark Associates

254
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,137
and probably find
a "Landmark Associates" business

255
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,722
in any state.

256
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,058
I looked at the Landmark Associates

257
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,104
at the address that he said
there was a Landmark Associates,

258
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,189
and there just simply wasn't one there.

259
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,945
My client gave to Christopher
about $50,000 to $60,000

260
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,907
with the expectation
that he would return some of that money…

261
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,326
-…with interest as an investment.
-Yeah.

262
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,914
[Scott] But when he could not
pay my client back,

263
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,292
he would say, "Your Venmo is not working."

264
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,252
"Your PayPal is not working."

265
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,337
-So…
-Okay.

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,465
Before I thought
to reach out to Christopher,

267
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,928
I wanted to get all the background I could
on him before making initial contact.

268
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,262
[Brianne] Of course, yeah.

269
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,893
I sent subpoenas
to Zelle, Venmo, and PayPal.

270
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,729
What'd you learn from that information?

271
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,981
[Scott] Between Zelle, Venmo, and PayPal,

272
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:47,237
he had received $300,000 just in one year
from multiple female victims.

273
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,156
That's insane.

274
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,908
[Scott] Yeah.

275
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,870
If we can talk to these victims
and perhaps get statements from them,

276
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,415
that just makes our ability
to present these cases that much stronger.

277
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,335
Hopefully we can give him
some real consequences.

278
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,295
Okay. Thank you so much.

279
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,172
Of course. I hope you get him.

280
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,256
[Brianne] Thank you.

281
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,385
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Brianne] Hey, Cecilie.

282
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:15,057
Guess how much he has taken
from multiple women thus far.

283
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,980
Around $300,000
within a year span, approximately.

284
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,731
This is horrendous.

285
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,654
[Brianne] Can you imagine how much money
in total this man has taken so far?

286
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,449
We need to see if we can contact
these women and get their statements.

288

-[Rhiannon] Oh, hi there.

-[Brianne] Hi, Robin.
-[Robin] Hello.

290
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,713
I'm investigating Chris Lloyd.

291
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,717
[Rhiannon] I met Chris
on an online dating app.

292
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,721
And he was easy to talk to,
and he used to play sports.

293
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,556
Like, very smart.

294
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,975
[Robin] We had this good,
healthy relationship.

295
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,478
He was professional
and had his shit together, basically.

296
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,438
Yeah.

297
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,025
[Rhiannon] He really showed concern
about my future,

298
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,609
like, retirement,

299
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,864
and started talking about, um,
like, a residual dividend account,

300
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,450
something that
I would live off the interest.

301
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,160
You know, he just made it sound so easy.

302
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,204
[Robin] Everything was in writing,
a legal contract.

303
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,917
I was completely convinced this was
my boyfriend at this point. You know?

304
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,836
Yeah, and he looked legitimate.

305
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,672
He seemed to be legitimate
with what his story was.

306
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,842
How much did he scam you out of?

307
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,553
[Robin] Probably $75,000.

308
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,722
Oh my God. That's a lot of money.

309
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,892
[Robin] I filed a police report,
but they didn't do anything.

310
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,812
[Rhiannon] I can't believe
that I gave him $150,000 for investment.

311
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,106
I went to the police,

312
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,817
but, you know, there's still kind of
the shock factor, like,

313
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,985
this happened to me.

314
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,782
Do you have any idea
where he's living at right now?

315
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,075
[Robin] No.

316
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,035
Where do you think he might be?

317
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,829
-[Rhiannon] I don't know. He's slippery.
-No. Mm. Yeah.

318
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,331
He's just a snake.

319
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,128
[Brianne] No one has seen Chris in months.

320
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,965
But if we can't find him,

321
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,469
we've got no chance
of the police taking on Lindsay's case.

322
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,554
[tense music plays]

323
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,935
[Cecilie] We need the guy
to get justice one way or the other.

324
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,855
The heartbreak
that he's leaving all these people,

325
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,692
it's just not right,
and that he can just vanish?

326
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,199
-[female producer] Are you doing okay?
-No, I'm not.

327
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,744
This is very draining for me, you know?

328
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,420
[sobs] It breaks my heart,
you know, all these people

329
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,215
he's taking everything from.

330
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,682
I can only imagine
how difficult it is for her to see

331
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,436
the pain and the hurt that
a lot of these victims are articulating.

332
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,651
I'm pretty sure it makes her
reminisce on the deceit and the lies

333
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:17,239
that she had to witness
and overcome and… and heal from.

334
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,035
I think that's what makes
Cecilie's role in this so powerful

335
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,707
because she knows what they're feeling,
she knows what they're going through,

336
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,336
and she can just
walk them through what's necessary

337
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,007
to get them on the other side of this
and hopefully get them justice.

338
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,968
[exhales heavily]

339
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,056
[music ends]

340
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,310
[somber music plays]

341
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,816
[chimes]

342
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,406
[Cecilie] I have maybe the biggest lead.

343
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,327
I'm in touch with a woman
who believes she's Chris's latest victim.

344
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,663
She's still in contact with him,
trying to get her money back.

345
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,916
-So she's on to him?
-Yeah.

346
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,878
So maybe we can get her
to lure him to, like, a public park.

347
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,922
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-[Brianne] That could work.

348
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,966
[chimes]

349
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,887
[chimes]

350
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,308
[tense music plays]

351
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:32,064
[Brianne] We received information
from one of Chris's latest victims.

352
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,275
And she has, um, set up an opportunity

353
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,779
to potentially lure him
into this park for us.

354
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,907
He thinks he's meeting her in the park,

355
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,785
but it's really a chance for us
to track him down.

356
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,997
It's a big moment
because we could potentially follow him,

357
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,874
figure out where he's living.

358
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,628
He supposedly currently drives
a black Lexus with red interior.

359
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,005
So that's gonna be
the primary car that we're looking for.

360
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,219
We know this guy is very elusive,
he's very shady,

361
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,054
and he's very unpredictable.

362
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,975
Lindsay is here to help positively ID him.

363
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,687
Our local P.I. is gonna help us track him.

364
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,564
We don't know what direction
he might come from,

365
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,025
so we're covering all entrances.

366
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,238
A lot of this is one-shot opportunity.
So we all have to be on our A-game.

367
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,281
[Cecilie] Awesome.

368
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,285
[gasps]

369
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,831
Can anybody see who's in that white car
that slowed down right next to us?

370
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:35,669
-Does that look like it's him?
-I don't have a visual, but it's parking.

371
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
[suspenseful music plays]

372
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,636
That's not Chris.

373
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,430
Oh, come on.

374
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,515
[chimes]

375
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,684
[chimes]

376
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,437
[Cecilie] Fifteen minutes.

377
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,522
That's very close to him.

378
00:21:55,605 --> 00:22:00,736
So if it's 15 minutes to get here,
he must live reasonably close to here.

379
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,612
Hi, Bri, are you there?

380
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,573
Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?

381
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,283
He's just 15 minutes away.

382
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,716
-[Cecilie] Oh!
-Oh, that's him. That's him.

383
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,261
-Oh my God. Just… Right there.
-That's him. That's him right there.

384
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:31,141
-Oh my God. Chris is here. Chris is here.
-[Lindsay] He's here in his black car.

385
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,393
[Brianne] All right, guys, he's here.

386
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,314
[gasps]

387
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,983
-[Lindsay] Oh my God. He's here.
-Oh my God.

388
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,489
[Brianne] He's getting out, guys. Perfect.

389
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,117
[Cecilie] Fuck.

390
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,204
[Lindsay] Ooh, now my heart's beating.

391
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,753
He's moving.

392
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,005
[gasps] Oh God.

393
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,018
[foreboding music plays]

394
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,941
[chimes]

395
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,197
[chimes]

396
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,828
[Anita] He's moving.
He's walking towards his car.

397
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,205
[Brianne] Anita, get ready to follow him.

398
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,584
[music intensifies]

399
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,433
Anita, what's your location?
I'm following.

400
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,146
We're going north
on, uh, State College Boulevard.

401
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,608
[Brianne] This could be our only shot
at figuring out where this guy lives.

402
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,693
Stay with him.

403
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:11,408
It's gonna be difficult following him.
He's looking around and changing lanes.

404
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,244
He's making a left.

405
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,123
I don't wanna go with him
because he's, um…

406
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,419
I'm gonna go maneuver,
see if I can beat him.

407
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,504
[Brianne] Get on the other side.
Wait for him.

408
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,926
[tires screeching]

409
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,808
-Yeah, he's hauling ass now.
-Haul ass with him.

410
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:43,064
[Anita] He's making a right
on Krueger Street, residential.

411
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,691
Okay, keep your eyes on that.

412
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,569
Maybe he's going home.

413
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,448
He's going west on…

414
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,370
Fuck, he disappeared. Um…

415
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,208
I can't find him.

416
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,918
You lost sight of him?

417
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,968
He's probably in one of these units
with the closed garages.

418
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,179
He disappeared quick.

419
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,308
[Brianne] The good news is
that he's still in California,

420
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,268
and we have his license plate number.

421
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,437
He can't run forever.

422
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,732
[gentle music plays]

423
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,484
[Brianne] We've got a solid case.

424
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,571
We know he lied about being
a professional baseball player,

425
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,283
and we know he was never
a registered financial advisor.

426
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,620
And we have other victims
who can corroborate Lindsay's story.

427
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,542
Lindsay claims she lost $140,000.

428
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,460
-Yes.
-Lauren lost over $50,000.

429
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,712
Rhiannon lost over $150,000.

430
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
I think that's what's important with this.

431
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,050
It's just showing
that it's not an isolated incident.

432
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,512
It's time Lindsay presents this
to the authorities.

433
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,724
[Cecilie] Hi, Lindsay.
I've got some good news.

434
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,643
We know that you've struggled

435
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,771
to get the police
to take this case seriously in the past.

436
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,774
But I have been in touch
with a district attorney,

437
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,401
and they've agreed to meet

438
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,821
and might be able to help
get the police to pick up the case.

439
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:19,995
I am now headed to a very important
and exciting meeting with DA Erin West.

440
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,039
And she's one of the leading investigators
in romance fraud,

441
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,459
and she's a deputy district attorney
here in California.

442
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,838
We're both fraud fighters,

443
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,507
so I'm actually
very excited myself personally

444
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,010
to be able to meet her
'cause I kind of look up to her.

445
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,389
So I've become a bit giddy, you know,
'cause I'm gonna meet Erin West.

446
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,349
I'm so sorry, but she is super cool.

447
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,861
-[Cecilie] Hi, Lindsay. Good to see you.
-[Lindsay] Hi.

448
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,572
-[Cecilie] How are you? I'm good.
-[Lindsay] Good, you? Good.

449
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,993
So what I have here
is actually the documentation.

450
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,913
So I feel like you can be the one
to actually bring that in.

451
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,334
-[Lindsay] Awesome. It's important.
-Because it's kind of… It's your work.

452
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,877
-Yeah, for sure.
-Thank you.

453
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,049
-[Lindsay] Hello. Hi, how are you?
-[Erin] Hey! Hey.

454
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,968
-Really nice to see you guys.
-[Lindsay] You too.

455
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,553
Thank you for meeting.

456
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:23,141
Lindsay was defrauded
by Chris Lloyd out of $140,000

457
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,810
in what we believe was an investment scam.

458
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:32,192
It's almost 300 pages from start till end
with evidence of the manipulation.

459
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,737
So we know there are so many more victims.

460
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,157
I am not…
I am one of like maybe a dozen plus.

461
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,533
-Right.
-[Lindsay] That's… yeah.

462
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,536
[Erin] I'm really sorry
this happened to you.

463
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,665
This is the fake contract.

464
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,041
-[Lindsay] Yeah.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

465
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,140
[Erin] I've never seen a case like this.

466
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,687
I have never seen
an in-person romance case like this.

467
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,191
And then when you tell me, "Oh,
it happened to her and her and her…"

468
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,109
Wow.

469
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,987
-I want this case. This is a great case.
-Yeah? Yeah.

470
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,450
I don't like the way you got bounced
around between police departments.

471
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,787
But I can also see how something
like this falls between the cracks.

472
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,418
We need to, like, dig it out of the cracks
and get it seen

473
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,421
because this is a really important case.

474
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,173
I would charge it
as theft by false pretenses.

475
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,300
-Let's shine some light on this. Let's--
-Yeah.

476
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,468
Let's ask some questions.

477
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,470
Let's figure out where things are

478
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,764
and what it would take
to move things forward.

479
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,934
-This game's not over.
-No, okay. That's good to hear.

480
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,894
-Bye.
-[Lindsay] Good to check in with you.

481
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,731
-Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
-'Course. So good to see you.

482
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,483
-So how are you feeling?
-I feel great.

483
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,487
I feel like that was, like,
very productive, very helpful.

484
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,781
-Thank you. Honestly.
-[Cecilie] Have a hug.

485
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,284
Thank you so much for everything, always.

486
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,120
-[Cecilie] What a journey. I know.
-Honestly.

487
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,166
[Cecilie] To even get in the room
with a district attorney is rare.

488
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,210
And for it to be so encouraging
about the case, it's…

489
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,130
It's a one in a million.
Like, it doesn't happen. It just doesn't.

490
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,507
[gentle music plays]

491
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,885
I'm done for the day. [chuckles]

492
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:32,687
Someone like Chris, who's managed
to slip through the cracks somehow,

493
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,399
deserves to finally,
you know, pay for what he's done.

494
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,860
He belongs in jail.

495
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,823
And I'm determined to put this behind me
and move on with my life.

496
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,826
[curious music plays]

497
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,394
[Brianne] I've seen a lot
as an investigator for 15 years.

498
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,106
A lot of times,
the bad guys don't get caught.

499
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,026
And victims don't get justice.

500
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:27,116
So it is refreshing for me to play a part
in balancing the scales a little bit.

501
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:34,415
It's important for us to continue
this fight for justice and help people.

502
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:40,588
[Cecilie] We may not stop every scam,
but we can stop the silence.

503
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,799
There's power in speaking up.

504
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,635
[Shareza] You did a really good job.
You should be proud.

505
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,471
[officer] It's gone past a civil matter
into a criminal matter.

506
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,056
Oh God!

507
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,850
[sobbing]

508
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,311
-[Cecilie] We exposed these fraudsters.
-[Nykki] You've been conning women.

509
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,189
[Cecilie] And shown people
how to hold them accountable.

510
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,902
Do I deserve how you treated me?
Stole from me?

511
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
You're going to jail.

512
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,242
[Cecilie] They fucked with the wrong women
this time around.

513
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,662
[women cheering]

514
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,290
[Cecilie] This is just the beginning.

515
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,583
-Cheers!
-[Brianne] To justice!

516
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,917
[Cecilie] We can't let scammers

517
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,837
destroy one of the most
beautiful things in life.

518
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,380
Love.

519
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,341
