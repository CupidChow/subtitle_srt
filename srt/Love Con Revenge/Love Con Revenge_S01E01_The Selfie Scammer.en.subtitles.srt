My name is Jill Schardein.

00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,491
[Jill] I met a man online, Todd Dean.

54
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,620
We dated for almost a year.

This was the first time
that I'd gone onto a dating site.

I'd been divorced for ten years.
My daughter was 17 years old.

I was very successful in my career
at that point in time,

00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,159
so I was excited
about trying to get into the dating scene.

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,457
I guess I was looking for a family man,

someone with a career that was successful,

79
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:20,635

he checked off every single box.

he's hiking, he's doing yoga.

He's got it all. He's got everything."

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,151
I googled him,
and there were a couple YouTube videos

about his mental health facility.

My name is Todd Dean. I'm the CEO
and founder of Sanjara Wellness.

to see his wellness facility.

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,077
[curious music plays]

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,745
[Jill] For the second date,

170
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,414
he decided that he was gonna take me
to get my nails done.

171
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,625
What girls don't wanna be pampered?

172
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,002
-[Todd] Have you had that color before?
-No.

173
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,797
[Jill] He suggested the green color.

174
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,553
Not anything I would have ever
gotten put on my nails, ever.

175
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,806
-[Todd] You like that color?
-I love it. I absolutely love it.

176
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,561
But he wanted to spend time with me.
He wanted to do things with me and for me.

177
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,187
That made me happy.

178
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:29,110
Early on, he gave me a key
to his condo in downtown Nashville.

179
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,197
The condo matched
Todd's personality to a T.

180
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,657
It was flashy.

181
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:40,454
During the week, I stayed at his condo,
even if he wasn't there.

182
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,749
Essentially, kind of like
we were "playing house," almost.

183
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,918
I was walking on clouds, literally.

184
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,798
It was definitely moving into
what I thought was a relationship.

185
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,638
I was having a blast because he was fun.
He was so much fun to be around.

186
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,682
That's the way it was in the beginning.

187
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,564
Romance fraud comes in many forms,
but there is a playbook.

188
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,775
Fraudsters, they will mirror you.

189
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,071
They pretend
to be the perfect human for you.

190
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,700
They prey on what all of us want in life,
and that is love.

191
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,661
[melancholy music plays]

192
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,083
[Jill] I do remember
we were playing music,

193
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,503
and he was talking more about himself
and about his childhood,

194
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,591
kind of giving me
a little bit more insight to who he was.

195
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,679
It really did feel good
because I felt like he was, you know,

196
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,432
bringing me
into a part of his world, right?

197
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,394
Even though I was a little nervous,

198
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,483
I opened myself up
a little bit to him about my mother.

199
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,904
She had committed suicide in 2016.

200
00:10:55,696 --> 00:11:00,368
And I've struggled with depression
and mental health for years.

201
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,871
I'd been to a trauma facility,

202
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,709
so I still had some traumas
that I hadn't finished working through.

203
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,796
I felt like he could relate.

204
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,800
It felt amazing
because now I'm starting to have feelings.

205
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,720
I'd only known him
for a short amount of time,

206
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
but I was all in.

207
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,518
[music fades]

208
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,313
So when did he ask you
for money for the first time?

209
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,982
-And how did that request come about?
-You knowâ€¦

210
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,319
I mean, a month and a half
into the relationship,

211
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,071
he needed $1,000.

212
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,156
[soft music plays]

213
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,286
[Jill] Todd was telling me that
he needed money for operating expenses

214
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,373
for his wellness facility, Sanjara.

215
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,002
This was gonna be
a high-end wellness retreat.

216
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,841
He's got top-notch doctors.
He's got a top-notch team.

217
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,595
Sanjara would be able
to heal any type of issues,

218
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
whether that ranged
from addiction to trauma.

219
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:11,063
I did wonder why someone
with this $1.8 million property

220
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,982
would even need to ask me for money.

221
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,193
He told me that it's a startup,

222
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,030
and he just needs this help
for finishing Sanjara.

223
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,077
And being that mental health
has always been an area close to my heart,

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,997
it was just something
that I really wanted to help with.

225
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,959
In the very beginning,
he gave me that money back

226
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,378
pretty quickly, plus another 500.

227
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
Like, "Thank you.
Here's a little extra for you."

228
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,095
You know, like, he's just being
this upstanding, great guy.

229
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,684
But as I got more into the relationship,

230
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,938
he really didn't talk about anything else
except for getting money in the door.

231
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,024
[tense music plays]

232
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
[Cecilie] Sometimes a fraudster will ask

233
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,196
for smaller amounts at the start
and then pay them back.

234
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,993
It's just such a smart and simple way
to win the trust of their victims.

235
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,077
But after a while,

236
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,915
they will just ask for bigger sums,
and it will kind of never stop.

237
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,375
All I can think about is money right now.

238
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,543
[cell phone chimes]

239
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,129
[Jill] He would just keep asking,
and I would keep giving.

240
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,887
I was not concerned about him
not paying me back. I really wasn't.

241
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,599
He would always say he had money
coming in within a week or two weeks.

242
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,228
It absolutely felt like
we were building something together.

243
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,814
You know, I thought
there was a bigger picture here.

244
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,149
Ultimately, this will open
and help other people,

245
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
and maybe I can be a part of it.

246
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,280
And then once I was in so deep,
I really didn't know how to get out of it.

247
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,366
[foreboding music plays]

248
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,284
[music fades]

249
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
-I gave him all of the money that I had.
-Wow.

250
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,834
He said, you know,
"Make sure you don't tell anyone."

251
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,796
[sighs] So I was dealing with
this internally,

252
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,507
and I didn't have anyone
to talk to about it.

253
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,884
-It was just complete anxiety.
-Yeah.

254
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,136
That is the same methods

255
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,514
in abusive relationships
you find in romance fraudâ€¦

256
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,724
-â€¦'cause they are taking advantage of you.
-Yeah.

257
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,101
Did you go to the police?

258
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,144
-I contacted the police.
-Yeah?

259
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,357
But at that time,
they just said, this is a civil matter.

260
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,152
This needs to be in civil court.
They wouldn't give me a case number.

261
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,657
What do you want to do about this?

262
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,327
It would really mean a lot if you could
help me get the police involved.

263
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,205
We need to gather
as much evidence as we can.

264
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,958
-Yeah.
-To build the strongest case possible.

265
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,588
I mean, I've tried so many other things.
This is theâ€¦ This is the last thing.

266
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,299
-So let's make it big.
-Yeah.

[tense music plays]

268
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,470
-[Jill] I'll see you soon. Yes.
-[Cecilie] For real. We'll start to work.

269
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,684
It's tough for her, you know?
And she's been so strong. So, yeah.

270
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,313
Oh, emotional. [laughs nervously]

271
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,150
It's heavy. It's kind of heavy for me.

272
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,155
It's just so eerily similar
to my own story.

273
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,701
I just know exactly the pain
that she's sitting with.

274
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,373
Back in 2018,
I met Simon Leviev on Tinder.

275
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,046
He was funny, charming, and handsome.

276
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,800
He told me that he was the CEO
of a big diamond company.

277
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,554
And his life was just extraordinary.

278
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,061
He was flying private jets.
He was wearing designer clothes.

279
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,897
And he was incredibly successful.

280
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,192
He just seemed like my perfect match.

281
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,072
But everything was a lie.
Just to take my money.

282
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,992
The man that I loved was never real.

283
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,414
When it happened to me,
I was incredibly alone.

284
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,334
And I don't want anyone else
to feel that way.

[tense music continues]

00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,548

and give her some answers.

I'm Magnum P.I. or somebody.

Riding around in a Ferrari,
solving crimes left and right.

296
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,470
But a private investigator
is someone who uncovers the truth.

297
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,515
Who reveals the deceit.

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,646
Prosecuting love fraudsters
is very difficult to do.

299
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,444
Police see it as relationship issues
that need to be resolved in civil court.

300
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:14,033
In order to build a case, I need to know
what was the story they told you

301
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,618
that made you give them the money.

302
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,873
And was that story
based on fact or fiction?

303
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,001
It's not easy.

304
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:29,548
But the first phase relies on
getting eyes on the perpetrator.

305
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,260
To find out
if they are who they say they are.

-Hey, how are you doing?
-I'm good.

Look, I need your help with a surveillance
case. Are you available?

-Yeah.
-Awesome.

So, problem is
we have to find this guy first. [laughs]

312
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,241
We don't know where he is.
So you got something to write with?

-I'm ready.
-All right. Perfect.

314
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,662
So his name is Todd Dean.

what we can find on this guy.

When I get a new case in,
my primary goal is discovery.

321
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,769
On LinkedIn he has
over, like, 500-plus connections.

00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,732
[Brianne] I wanna know
everything I possibly can about a suspect.

00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,526
What's their online presence?

324
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,113
Who are their contacts?
Who are their associates?

325
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,158
He has his position
like CEO and founder of Sanjara Wellness.

The charismatic leader

with a tremendous network of friends
and business associates.

"A proven visionary and leader."

-He sounds like a big shot.
-Yeah.

[Brianne] Oh look, we have videos of him.

332
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,551
[Todd] People today are struggling,
with their issues, with their families,

333
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,471
with their jobs, with addictions,
with mental health, with stress.

334
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:05,727
And they're looking for a place
of peace and solutions and results.

335
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,897
Sanjara Experience represents that.

336
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,778
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Fan.

337
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,781
This has been
one of the most amazing experiences.

338
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,034
Eastern philosophies,
some new ways of handling folks,

339
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,703
helping them live their best lives.

340
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,915
The world needs a place like Sanjara.
It will be unlike anything else.

341
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,961
Creating an environment and the curricula.

342
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,381
People's lives are gonna be changed
being a part of it,

343
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,091
so can't wait to be a part.

344
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,259
[Cecilie] Wow.

345
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,471
So many professionals
and doctors and psychologists.

346
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,976
All of these really big people that
are giving these amazing testimonials.

347
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,977
Yeah.

348
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,148
I think for sure we need to talk to some
of these people, figure out who they are.

349
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,400
[line ringing]

350
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,235
Hi, my name is Brianne.

351
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,614
I'm a private investigator,
and I'm investigating Todd Dean.

352
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,659
I am doing an investigation
into Todd Dean and Sanjara Wellness.

353
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,079
I got your name
from a promotional video that I watched,

354
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,374
and I wanted to ask you
a few questions about Sanjara.

355
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,418
[male] Sorry, I think you have
the wrong number.

356
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,921
[Brianne] Give me a call back, please.

357
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,963
Another no hit.

358
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,507
[Cecilie] No one is answering.

359
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,426
-[Brianne] No?
-[Cecilie] It just drops.

360
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,304
[line ringing]

361
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,481
Hi, Josh. My name is Brianne.

362
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:37,152
I'm a private investigator,
and I'm investigating Todd Dean.

363
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,281
I think your company
created the video for Sanjara?

364
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,492
[Josh] Yeah, I shot that back in 2021.

365
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,577
[Brianne] Okay, perfect.

366
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,998
[Josh] The video was really supposed to be
for investors, for funding.

367
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,835
He was, like, more of the CEO type of guy.

368
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,546
He brought the people
to try to make it work.

369
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,633
The professionals,
did they appear really genuine?

370
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,301
[Josh] For the most part, yeah.

371
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,596
Um, they really talked
about their fields of study

372
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,432
and how they would want
to utilize it in Sanjara.

373
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,936
A lot of them, I guess, were just trying
to see how this would work out.

374
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,189
[Brianne] What was your opinion
of Todd Dean when you first met him?

375
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,691
[Josh] He was different.

376
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,738
He was charming, and he was pretty flirty
with quite a few women there.

377
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,494
To be honest, the whole thing was weird.
Like, it really did feel kind of cultish.

378
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,332
Okay, one last question.
How did you get involved in this project?

379
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,085
[Josh] Through Sheena.
She is Todd's assistant.

380
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,630
She reached out to me.
She, like, ran the show.

381
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
[Brianne] Okay.
What was Sheena's last name?

382
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,386
-[Josh] I can't think of it right now.
-You can't remember her last name? Okay.

383
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,305
[Josh] I haven't talked to her since.

384
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,558
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

385
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
Bye.

386
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,893
Finally.

387
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,813
Yes. Finally, somebody's willing to talk.

388
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,273
We need to find Sheena.

389
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,192
She's definitely someone
that we wanna talk to.

390
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,694
[intriguing music plays]

391
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,737
[chimes]

392
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,407
[chimes]

393
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:14,082
[Cecilie] Straight ahead.
Then to the left here.

394
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,919
So, our local P.I., Michael,
has a lead on Todd.

395
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,050
The thing about these leads is that
we have to act on them really quickly

396
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,886
because one minute they're here
and the next minute they're gone.

397
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,309
-[Brianne] Hey, Michael.
-How you doing?

398
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,312
-So, have you found our guy yet?
-We're working on it.

399
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,023
Yeah, there's a couple different things.
Here's his residence.

400
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,192
-[Brianne] It's an apartment complex?
-[Michael] Yeah.

401
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,027
Everyone's saying he lives there.

402
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,488
So, I've watched this residence a lot,

403
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,741
and I have never once seen him
come out of it, driving or walking.

404
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,618
I think, he's underground right now.

405
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,120
-He's avoiding as many people as possible.
-[Brianne] Okay.

406
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,791
[Michael] This picture where
he takes his hat off looks a lot like him,

407
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,085
but just not 100% yet.

408
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,212
So, we're still ironing it out.

409
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,632
It's that we've seen him both,
you know, bald, hairâ€¦

410
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,966
-[Brianne] Yeah.
-With a goatee.

411
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,177
I feel like sometimes
he can be a chameleon almost.

412
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,429
-[Michael] And he mixes it up.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

413
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,807
So, where's our best opportunity
to catch this guy?

414
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,393
[Michael] So, I would say
we need to focus on his poker playing.

415
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,353
We know that he likes to play poker,

416
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,814
but we haven't seen him
at many of the poker locations yet,

417
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,273
so we keep making the rounds.

418
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,819
But we have a tip
that he may be there tonight.

419
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,323
[Brianne] I think it'll be worthwhile
for us to set up some surveillance on him.

420
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,617
All right. Thank you so much.
See you soon, okay?

421
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,702
[tense music plays]

422
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,998
So, we're on this for 4.6 miles.

423
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,458
-[Brianne] Okay.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

424
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,090
-Like kind of to the right. Sorry.
-Continue where? To the right? Okay.

425
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,343
[Brianne] It's important
to get eyes on a perpetrator

426
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,179
because you want to establish
a pattern of behavior.

427
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,931
[Cecilie] Okay, here.

428
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,184
The intention is to get into their world.

429
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,773
Is that him? There? Brianne?

430
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,567
Do you see?

431
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,278
-[Brianne] That's not it. Not it.
-[Cecilie] Not him.

432
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,699
You have to be careful
because you wanna be discreet,

433
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,076
and you don't want your cover blown.

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,744
Maybe. [gasps]

435
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,122
Doesn't look the build.

436
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,668
-No.
-No, they're passing up the Acura.

437
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
[Brianne] Oh, look at that man.
He's looking at us.

438
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,636
-Who? Who?
-[Brianne] That guy. Well, maybe not.

439
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,638
He's curious. He's definitely curious.

440
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,018
Okay. [clears throat]

441
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,979
Is that Todd?

442
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,899
[Brianne] That's him.

443
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,486
-[Cecilie] It's him.
-[Brianne] Oh my God. Let's follow him.

444
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,571
[dramatic music plays]

445
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,286
-[Brianne] Keep your eyes on him.
-[Cecilie] Yeah, he's going.

446
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,538
Right, right, right

447
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,581
and right again.

448
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,957
-Yeah?
-Yep.

449
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,007
[Cecilie] There's the car
directly in front of us now.

450
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
He's driving fast.

451
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,596
-[Brianne] He's two cars in front of you.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

452
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,350
-[Brianne] He is way too far ahead up now.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

453
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,393
[Brianne] You can see his right mirror.

454
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
-See his mirror?
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

455
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,606
-Keep your eye on a piece of his car.
-[Cecilie] Okay.

456
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,109
[Brianne] Keep your eye on that.
We got a visual again, so it's good.

457
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,320
[Cecilie gasps] He's taking off.

458
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,906
-[Brianne] Scottsville, Franklin exit.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

459
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,869
It just looks a lot more countryside.

460
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,665
[Brianne] Keep your eyes on him
'cause I'm losing a blind spot.

461
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,464
[music fades]

462
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,509
[Brianne] I don't have a visual
of him at all. Do you?

463
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
[Cecilie] Yeah, we lost sight of him now.

464
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,268
Oh. [gasps]

465
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,649
[Brianne] What's the numbers on there?

466
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,861
[Cecilie] Yeah, that's him.

467
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
-[Brianne] Okay, look at that.
-[Cecilie] It's Sanjara.

468
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,074
It's Sanjara.

469
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
[soft music plays]

470
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,251
[Jill] We would go to Sanjara
several times a week

471
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,089
because I would help him mow
and do yard work.

472
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,384
We were getting along wonderfully,

473
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:40,765
but thenâ€¦
he completely ended the relationship.

474
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,809
[somber music plays]

475
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,978
[Jill] I mean, I was heartbroken.

476
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,772
I just wasn't expecting it.

477
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,570
I felt like it was the end

478
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:57,907
until he started texting me again
saying, "Come back."

479
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,828
I'm thinking, well,
maybe he's changed his mind.

480
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,790
He just started
the relationship right back up.

481
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
Everything was the same.

482
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,088
Except now I felt like
I was walking on eggshells,

483
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,966
feeling very insecure
and not good about myself.

484
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,803
[Cecilie] They reel you in
with love and attention.

485
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,640
Once you're hooked,
they will unexpectedly pull away.

486
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,059
Suddenly you're the one
chasing their love and affection,

487
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,186
and that's the power shift that they want.

488
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,104
You're not thinking straight.

489
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,190
That's when they can get
even more money from you.

490
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,900
[foreboding music plays]

491
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,069
He wasn't physically abusing me,

492
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,572
but, I mean, there was
some sort of mental abuse going on.

493
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,243
You know you're not acting yourself
with me this morning.

494
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,953
Just saying, something's going on.

495
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:50,293
I think that I was trying to hang on
to any thread of relationship

496
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,711
that there could be there,

497
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,297
which also essentially put me into,

498
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,009
I think, anything that he would ask for,
I would do.

499
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Then, at one point,

500
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,059
he was telling me that he needed money
for the mortgage of Sanjara Wellness.

501
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:10,105
They increased the mortgage this month,
which I didn't realize, so it's, uhâ€¦

502
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,650
The only thing that I could think of
at that time

503
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,611
was taking money out of my retirement,

504
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,490
and I was able to get him $12,500.

505
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,868
[music fades]

506
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,412
His reaction wasâ€¦

507
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,127
You know, he was more so disappointed
that he would have liked to have had more.

508
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,754
[gentle music plays]

509
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,592
I had been dating Todd for almost a year,

510
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,679
and he was getting pretty desperate
for money.

511
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,723
You feel like sending me $25?

512
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,644
But, at that point,
I gave him everything that I had.

513
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,774
I needed to borrow money to pay
my mortgage because I'd given it to Todd.

514
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,154
So he asked if there was any way
I could ask my daughter to give him money,

515
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,905
and at that time she was 17.

516
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,577
[sniffles]

517
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,247
I told him no. [sobs]

518
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,707
Butâ€¦

519
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,586
I didn't have control over it,
and I'm just thankful for that

520
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,505
because I don't know
what I would have done

521
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,550
if I would've been in control of it.

522
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,844
And that scares me.

523
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,434
It just shows to you
that he will take money from anyone.

524
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,482
I realized, "Oh my gosh, I cannot believe
that I've fallen for this man."

525
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,027
Finally, I got to a point
that enough was enough.

526
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,153
And I was done.

527
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,284
That was the end of any type
of communication or relationship

528
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,619
that I had with Todd.

529
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,579
I was finished.

530
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,460
[intriguing music plays]

531
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,215
[Brianne] Now that we've got eyes on Todd,

532
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,677
we need to see if there's anyone else
that could substantiate Jill's claims.

533
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,305
According to Josh,

534
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,266
the cameraman
for Sanjara's promotional video,

535
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,143
there's a woman named Sheena.

536
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,687
She's supposedly his "personal assistant."

537
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,858
We need to find her.
She might have some inside information.

538
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,902
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-[Brianne] Yeah.

539
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
[Brianne] Which one is our Sheena?

540
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,369
Oh, you know, there's a million Sheenas.
Like, really?

541
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,162
[Cecilie] Finding a needle in a haystack.

542
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,872
-[Brianne] Absolutely.
-[Cecilie] Oh yeah.

543
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,129
[phone dialling]

544
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,090
[Brianne] The number is disconnected.

545
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,591
The call failed.

546
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,801
[phone dialling]

547
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,511
[Brianne] Another no-answer.

548
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,014
Oh, look, look, look.

549
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,225
I found her.

550
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,227
I got her.

551
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,480
Yes! Oh, it's absolutely her. Look.

552
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,401
Look. "Executive assistant
at Sanjara Wellness."

553
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,111
[Cecilie] Sanjara Wellness. Yes.

554
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,405
[Brianne] And she's got pictures
at Sanjara.

555
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,406
[Cecilie] Oh, yeah.

556
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,492
[line ringing]

557
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,953
[Brianne clears throat, hums]

558
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,414
[woman] Hi.

559
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,291
Hi, is this Sheena?

560
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,710
[Sheena] It is.

561
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,921
My name is Brianne.
Do you know a Todd Dean?

562
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,548
[Sheena] I do, yeah.

563
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,886
[soft music plays]

564
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,936
Sheena is out of the country.
Good Lord, Sheena.

565
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,568
Oh, looks like
we're approaching something.

566
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,819
[knocks on door]

567
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,989
-Hi. Yes.
-[Brianne] Sheena?

568
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,533
-Hi, I'm Brianne. May I come in?
-It's Brianne?

569
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,035
-Come on in.
-[Brianne] Thank you.

570
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,787
-Oh, you've got a little baby.
-[Sheena] Yes. How are you?

571
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
[Brianne] I'm doing well.

572
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,167
Are these your kids as well?

573
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,713
Yeah, so that'sâ€¦
I have actually three girls and four boys.

574
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,841
Look, I can only imagine
what breakfast looks like around here.

575
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,427
I have two, so I know
my hands are always full with two.

576
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,845
I can't imagine.

577
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,766
Well, thank you again for, um, agreeing
to meet with me on such short notice.

578
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,976
-I really appreciate that.
-My pleasure.

579
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,853
I'm investigating Todd Dean.

580
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,440
And just trying to find out
a little bit more information about him.

581
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,859
-Yeah.
-And Sanjara in general.

582
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,695
-Okay.
-Umâ€¦ How do you know Todd?

583
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,698
I just happened
to be scrolling on Facebook,

584
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,285
and in one of the Nashville groups,
there was a post.

585
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,913
It said,
"I need part-time office assistant."

586
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,999
-[Brianne] Okay.
-And it happened to be Todd Dean.

587
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,001
So I did a phone interview,

588
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,922
and within a couple of hours,
he was like, "I wanna hire you."

589
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,883
-[Brianne] Okay.
-And I was like, "Okay, perfect."

590
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,719
Tell me, what exactly is Sanjara?

591
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,139
What it is and what it's supposed to be
are two different things.

592
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,519
-Okay.
-It was a wellness experience.

593
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:04,190
It's where people would go
to kind of get their bearings back.

594
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:09,112
But when we started talking about
the finances of Sanjara as a business,

595
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,281
that's when I realized
it wasn't exactly what I thought it was.

596
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:16,619
[inhales] I started questioning, like,
how were we gonna pay things

597
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,830
and do things if there's no money?

598
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,207
-Right.
-And so he started showing meâ€¦

599
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,920
"Well, I just get money from investors."
It was like, "What are they investing in?"

600
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,922
And he's like, "Sanjara."

601
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,551
And I was like,
"So they're investing in an idea." Andâ€¦

602
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,761
Don't ever say that to him. He hates that.

603
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,180
-Because to him, Sanjara is real.
-Yeah.

604
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,183
-But it's never opened.
-Oh wow. Okay.

605
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,478
-It seems like scamming is what it is.
-That is scamming.

606
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,439
Especially with a business
that's not even open.

607
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,941
-Where are you spending the money?
-Right.

608
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,194
I did eventually gain access
to bank accounts and stuff like that,

609
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,114
and I would question,
"Well, where is the money going?"

610
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:57,368
-"We had $50,000 four days ago."
-Yeah.

611
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,413
And now we're scrambling
because we have $500.

612
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,125
Yeah. And did you ever get any answers?

613
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,668
We actually had disagreements

614
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:10,757
about personal transactions
going through the business account.

615
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,217
Every penny of that investor money

616
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,012
should be going
into rehabbing the building.

617
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,892
So, obviously,
he was getting money from investors.

618
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,477
Quote, unquote, "Investors."

619
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,857
But what about personal loans
or donations from other people?

620
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,526
Were there just girlfriends, maybe?

621
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,571
Was he getting money
from people like that as well?

622
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,530
Absolutely.

623
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,116
Prior to me coming on board with him,

624
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,745
he had apparently borrowed
some money from mostly women.

625
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,538
And they were private loans.

626
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,125
-So there was, uh, Karen.
-Okay.

627
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,881
And after I came on board with him,
we got Jill.

628
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,593
There was several of them I know of.

629
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,888
-Have you talked to any of these women?
-No.

630
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:04,435
Do you recall, um, like, how much money
he was getting just out of these women?

631
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:10,233
So, we were bringing in
anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 a month.

632
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,443
-Wow. And from investors?
-From investors.

633
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,653
Okay.

634
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,905
Do you have any, like, documents,

635
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,992
or any kind of documentation of any
of these things regarding him financially?

636
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,077
Yeah.

637
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,040
-And so these are the checking accounts.
-Okay.

638
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
-Oh, okay.
-For the business.

639
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,294
So this is one of our bridge loans.

640
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,255
-It's a 50,000.
-Okay.

641
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:39,220
And then we would just have all these,
like, $22, $10, $21, $50, $31.

642
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,597
When he transfers them
to his personal accountâ€¦

643
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,309
Wow. So there are
several transactions like this?

644
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,478
-Mm-hmm.
-[Brianne] Girl, this manâ€¦

645
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,397
[Sheena] "ATM withdrawal, $1,000."

646
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,774
-Yeah, straight to his personal account.
-Yeah.

647
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,569
They were investing
in the promise of helping other people

648
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,028
with mental health wellness.

649
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,282
He always preyed on the people thatâ€¦

650
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,783
-Were vulnerable.
-Yeah.

651
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,166
[Sheena] It felt like he was
turning Sanjara into a hunting ground.

652
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,878
So he could find
all of the vulnerable women

653
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,630
because that's what he was looking for.

654
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,306
[line ringing]

655
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,641
[Cecilie] Hello?

656
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,020
Cecilie, we have the smoking gun.

657
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,482
Sheena thinks Sanjara is a scam.

658
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,490
She thinks that he used Sanjara
to take advantage of vulnerable women.

659
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,453
-To manipulate them and take their money.
-That's disgusting.

660
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,374
We have bank statements
that could potentially show

661
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:55,254
that the money that he received
from Sanjara went straight to his pockets.

662
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm very fucking angry.

663
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,093
[Brianne] Sheena mentioned
someone named Karen from Idaho.

664
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,929
She may be another victim.

665
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,640
I have her details.
I need you to go talk to her.

666
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,726
[Cecilie] I think this is what is needed.

667
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,520
[dramatic music plays]

668
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:16,943
[Cecilie] Hi!

669
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,404
-Hi. Cecilie, hi! I'm Karen.
-Karen. So nice to meet you.

670
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,658
-Can I give you a hug?
-Yes, come on in. I'm holding the door.

671
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,078
-What a place. Yeah.
-Make yourself comfortable. Thank you.

672
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,621
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

673
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,751
So, if you can just take me back then.
I just know that you knew Todd.

674
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,005
When I met him,
it was years before Sanjara.

675
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,219
I was in Sun Valley skiing,
and he jumped on the lift with me.

676
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,513
We chatted.

677
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,809
He asked where I was from
and what did I do and was I married.

678
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,727
And he seemed nice enough.

679
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:57,191
So we finished skiing,
and we walked into the lodge and, um.

680
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,320
Right away it seemed like he knew people.
People were drawn to him.

681
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,824
Yeah. What is it about him?
Kind of like you were justâ€¦

682
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:11,122
He was really charming,
and there's aâ€¦ a charisma there.

683
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,043
He told me that he was from Seattle
and he was an entrepreneur.

684
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,630
He said that he had a house
in Sun Valley right on the river

685
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,590
but he also had his condo in Seattle.

686
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,429
I lived in Sun Valley for a long time
as a second home.

687
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,265
So I knew that was not the kind of place
you would hang out

688
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,641
if you didn't have any money.

689
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,687
-Yeah.
-He seemed to be a successful businessman.

690
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,233
He said he was working on
all these different investment projects.

691
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,697
And that seemed pretty exciting to me.
And so, the first time it was likeâ€¦

692
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,824
Hey, do you wannaâ€¦

693
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,118
-Maybe you wanna get in on this.
-Hmm.

694
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,746
Like, maybe--
Like he was doing me a favor.

695
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,875
-Like, this is not open to everybody butâ€¦
-Wow, that's interesting. That is.

696
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,962
"If you want, I could probably get you in
for maybe, like, $5,000."

697
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,423
-I was like, "Okay, I could do that."
-Mm.

698
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,468
-There were a couple of those projects.
-Okay.

699
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,511
That were really small startups that--

700
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,014
I mean, he wasn't asking me for $100,000.

701
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,640
But they were all little ones.

702
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,809
And they started adding up.

703
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,562
There was a point
that I started feeling like,

704
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:22,693
"This isâ€¦ doesn't smell right to me."
And I started keeping track of everything.

705
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,570
All of a sudden,

706
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,782
you know, all the red flags
that I had pushed down into the sand,

707
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,368
I looked back and all I saw was red.

708
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:35,122
That was when I knew
I had in fact been scammed.

709
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,208
[curious music plays]

710
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,796
[Karen] For some reason,
he agreed to sign this document

711
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,175
that admits and acknowledges
that he owes me the money.

712
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:51,639
Here, there it is. $24,920.

713
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,352
What I think is that he agreed to sign it

714
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,772
because he felt
it would make him look legit.

715
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,901
He did pay a few times. Then he defaulted.

716
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,154
I said to my lawyer, "What do I do?"
He said, "You can either let it go,

717
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,573
or you can now
file the default judgment."

718
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
"Then that's a permanent court record."

719
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,997
As soon as that judgment was filed,
that was when I started getting contacted

720
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,791
by people who were searching him

721
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,420
to see if he was legit,
and that's how it really started.

722
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,922
How many victims are there in this?

723
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,840
There's so many.

724
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,511
What I would love from you,
if you would be willing,

725
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,264
is to give a statement
about your experience.

726
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,516
And put me in touch with the other women.

727
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,559
Of course.

728
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,936

[chimes]

731
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:53,659
[Brianne] The police historically
don't take these cases seriously.

732
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,036
So it's on us to make it airtight.

733
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,168
Our challenge is to prove
that they're not alone

734
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,963
in what they're accusing this person of.

735
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:13,137
If we can corroborate their stories
and show a clear pattern of behavior,

736
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,639
that'll help us prove
that Todd is a fraudster.

737
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,557
Hi.

738
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,976
Hi, there you are.

739
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,436
-Hi.
-My God.

740
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,522
-Hi, wonderful to meet you.
-You too.

741
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,026
We're doing now
an investigation into Todd Dean.

742
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,653
He makes himself look real good, right?

743
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:35,910
Oh, CEO of Sanjara.
Charming, handsome, very professional.

744
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:41,207
He started sending me texts
every single day, multiple times a day.

745
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,920
He flatters you to death,
makes you feel like a million dollars.

746
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,964
"You are so, so beautiful.
You are so, so pretty."

747
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:55,513
He preys on women who are newly
out of a really tough breakup or divorce.

748
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
I had just gotten out of a divorce.

749
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,062
I was in the process
of ending a very toxic relationship.

750
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,358
He'll ask you those questions
about mental health and trauma

751
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,777
to really bring down your guard,

752
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,738
um, and make you
even more vulnerable to him, right?

753
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
He didn't want me to think for myself.

754
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,827
It was more like, I want to control you.

755
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,706
Then he built his trust by grooming them,
and then he asked for the money.

756
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,963
He called me up, like, in desperation,
saying that he needed money.

757
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,632
It was only going to be for like 48 hours.

758
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,386
He texted me in the morning.
I thought, "Oh great, a text from Todd."

759
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,181
Instead it was a request for $10,000.

760
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,310
I wired him $10,000 with the understanding
that he would pay it back.

761
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,062
within 48 hours.

762
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
Never once did he even try to pay me back.

763
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,737
Would you be willing to give a statement
on your experience with him?

764
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,074
Yeah, there's no accountability
that's been placed on him yet.

765
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,951
[Theresa] 100%, yes.

766
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,329
If he is not stopped

767
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,207
by the police, by the judicial system,

768
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,418
he will continue this.

769
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,046
[Brianne] This is serious stuff.
He's done this with so many women.

770
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,549
It's clearly his MO.
This is how he operates.

771
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,430
He needs to be stopped. Like, he can't
keep getting away with this.

772
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,435
[Brianne] Criminals think, "I got away
with it once. I'll do it again."

773
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,854
And they feel untouchable.

774
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,692
So what's helpful in cases like this
is establishing whether or not

775
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,653
the perpetrator is currently engaging

776
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,032
in criminal activity
and defrauding someone.

777
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,870
Because if they are,
the police are more likely to act quickly.

778
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,956
This could really help
make or break a case.

A lot of women did struggle
with self-esteem and self-confidence.
