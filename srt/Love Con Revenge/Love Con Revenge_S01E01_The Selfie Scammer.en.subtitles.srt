[on phone] Hi, Cecilie.
My name is Jill Schardein.

53
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,491
[Jill] I met a man online, Todd Dean.

54
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,620
We dated for almost a year.

and hopefully be a safe space.

[Jill] I met Todd Dean on Facebook Dating.

This was the first time
that I'd gone onto a dating site.

74
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,777
I'd been divorced for ten years.
My daughter was 17 years old.

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,739
I was very successful in my career
at that point in time,

76
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,159
so I was excited
about trying to get into the dating scene.

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,457
I guess I was looking for a family man,

78

someone with a career that was successful,

79
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:20,635
and when I saw Todd Dean's profile,
he checked off every single box.

His pictures, he's skiing,
he's hiking, he's doing yoga.

I mean, it was kind of like, "Wow.
He's got it all. He's got everything."

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,151
I googled him,
and there were a couple YouTube videos

83
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,989
where he was holding a speaking engagement
about his mental health facility.

My name is Todd Dean. I'm the CEO
and founder of Sanjara Wellness.

and happy what he was doing.

and camouflage pants and boots.

We met at the restaurant. I walked in.

cowboy boots as well.

he mentioned if I would ride out with him
to see his wellness facility.

106

he planted a kiss on me.

all throughout the day.

to draw you in and make you feel special.

00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,568
I didn't know about it either.
I just loved love, you know?

-Yeah, right.
-I didn't see it like that.

166
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,989
Yeah. That's exactly what he did.

-Yeah.

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,077
[curious music plays]

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,745
[Jill] For the second date,

170
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,414
he decided that he was gonna take me
to get my nails done.

171
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,625
What girls don't wanna be pampered?

172
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,002
-[Todd] Have you had that color before?
-No.

173
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,797
[Jill] He suggested the green color.

174
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,553
Not anything I would have ever
gotten put on my nails, ever.

175
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,806
-[Todd] You like that color?
-I love it. I absolutely love it.

176
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,561
But he wanted to spend time with me.
He wanted to do things with me and for me.

177
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,187
That made me happy.

178
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:29,110
Early on, he gave me a key
to his condo in downtown Nashville.

179
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,197
The condo matched
Todd's personality to a T.

180
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,657
It was flashy.

181
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:40,454
During the week, I stayed at his condo,
even if he wasn't there.

182
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,749
Essentially, kind of like
we were "playing house," almost.

183
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,918
I was walking on clouds, literally.

184
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,798
It was definitely moving into
what I thought was a relationship.

185
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,638
I was having a blast because he was fun.
He was so much fun to be around.

186
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,682
That's the way it was in the beginning.

187
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,564
Romance fraud comes in many forms,
but there is a playbook.

188
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,775
Fraudsters, they will mirror you.

189
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,071
They pretend
to be the perfect human for you.

190
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,700
They prey on what all of us want in life,
and that is love.

191
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,661
[melancholy music plays]

192
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,083
[Jill] I do remember
we were playing music,

193
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,503
and he was talking more about himself
and about his childhood,

194
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,591
kind of giving me
a little bit more insight to who he was.

195
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,679
It really did feel good
because I felt like he was, you know,

196
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,432
bringing me
into a part of his world, right?

197
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,394
Even though I was a little nervous,

198
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,483
I opened myself up
a little bit to him about my mother.

199
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,904
She had committed suicide in 2016.

200
00:10:55,696 --> 00:11:00,368
And I've struggled with depression
and mental health for years.

201
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,871
I'd been to a trauma facility,

202
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,709
so I still had some traumas
that I hadn't finished working through.

203
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,796
I felt like he could relate.

204
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,800
It felt amazing
because now I'm starting to have feelings.

205
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,720
I'd only known him
for a short amount of time,

206
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
but I was all in.

207
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,518
[music fades]

208
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,313
So when did he ask you
for money for the first time?

209
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,982
-And how did that request come about?
-You know…

210
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,319
I mean, a month and a half
into the relationship,

211
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,071
he needed $1,000.

212
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,156
[soft music plays]

213
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,286
[Jill] Todd was telling me that
he needed money for operating expenses

214
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,373
for his wellness facility, Sanjara.

215
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,002
This was gonna be
a high-end wellness retreat.

216
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,841
He's got top-notch doctors.
He's got a top-notch team.

217
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,595
Sanjara would be able
to heal any type of issues,

218
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
whether that ranged
from addiction to trauma.

219
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:11,063
I did wonder why someone
with this $1.8 million property

220
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,982
would even need to ask me for money.

221
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,193
He told me that it's a startup,

222
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,030
and he just needs this help
for finishing Sanjara.

223
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,077
And being that mental health
has always been an area close to my heart,

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,997
it was just something
that I really wanted to help with.

225
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,959
In the very beginning,
he gave me that money back

226
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,378
pretty quickly, plus another 500.

227
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
Like, "Thank you.
Here's a little extra for you."

228
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,095
You know, like, he's just being
this upstanding, great guy.

229
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,684
But as I got more into the relationship,

230
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,938
he really didn't talk about anything else
except for getting money in the door.

231
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,024
[tense music plays]

232
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
[Cecilie] Sometimes a fraudster will ask

233
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,196
for smaller amounts at the start
and then pay them back.

234
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,993
It's just such a smart and simple way
to win the trust of their victims.

235
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,077
But after a while,

236
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,915
they will just ask for bigger sums,
and it will kind of never stop.

237
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,375
All I can think about is money right now.

238
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,543
[cell phone chimes]

239
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,129
[Jill] He would just keep asking,
and I would keep giving.

240
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,887
I was not concerned about him
not paying me back. I really wasn't.

241
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,599
He would always say he had money
coming in within a week or two weeks.

242
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,228
It absolutely felt like
we were building something together.

243
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,814
You know, I thought
there was a bigger picture here.

244
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,149
Ultimately, this will open
and help other people,

245
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
and maybe I can be a part of it.

246
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,280
And then once I was in so deep,
I really didn't know how to get out of it.

247
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,366
[foreboding music plays]

248
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,284
[music fades]

249
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
-I gave him all of the money that I had.
-Wow.

250
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,834
He said, you know,
"Make sure you don't tell anyone."

251
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,796
[sighs] So I was dealing with
this internally,

252
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,507
and I didn't have anyone
to talk to about it.

253
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,884
-It was just complete anxiety.
-Yeah.

254
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,136
That is the same methods

255
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,514
in abusive relationships
you find in romance fraud…

256
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,724
-…'cause they are taking advantage of you.
-Yeah.

257
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,101
Did you go to the police?

258
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,144
-I contacted the police.
-Yeah?

259
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,357
But at that time,
they just said, this is a civil matter.

260
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,152
This needs to be in civil court.
They wouldn't give me a case number.

261
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,657
What do you want to do about this?

262
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,327
It would really mean a lot if you could
help me get the police involved.

263
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,205
We need to gather
as much evidence as we can.

264
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,958
-Yeah.
-To build the strongest case possible.

265
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,588
I mean, I've tried so many other things.
This is the… This is the last thing.

266
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,299
-So let's make it big.
-Yeah.

267

[tense music plays]

268
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,470
-[Jill] I'll see you soon. Yes.
-[Cecilie] For real. We'll start to work.

269
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,684
It's tough for her, you know?
And she's been so strong. So, yeah.

270
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,313
Oh, emotional. [laughs nervously]

271
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,150
It's heavy. It's kind of heavy for me.

272
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,155
It's just so eerily similar
to my own story.

273
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,701
I just know exactly the pain
that she's sitting with.

274
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,373
Back in 2018,
I met Simon Leviev on Tinder.

275
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,046
He was funny, charming, and handsome.

276
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,800
He told me that he was the CEO
of a big diamond company.

277
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,554
And his life was just extraordinary.

278
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,061
He was flying private jets.
He was wearing designer clothes.

279
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,897
And he was incredibly successful.

280
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,192
He just seemed like my perfect match.

281
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,072
But everything was a lie.
Just to take my money.

282
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,992
The man that I loved was never real.

283
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,414
When it happened to me,
I was incredibly alone.

284
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,334
And I don't want anyone else
to feel that way.

[tense music continues]

286
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,548
And I hope that we can help Jill
and give her some answers.

I'm Magnum P.I. or somebody.

Riding around in a Ferrari,
solving crimes left and right.

296
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,470
But a private investigator
is someone who uncovers the truth.

297
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,515
Who reveals the deceit.

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,646
Prosecuting love fraudsters
is very difficult to do.

299
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,444
Police see it as relationship issues
that need to be resolved in civil court.

300
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:14,033
In order to build a case, I need to know
what was the story they told you

301
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,618
that made you give them the money.

302
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,873
And was that story
based on fact or fiction?

303
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,001
It's not easy.

304
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:29,548
But the first phase relies on
getting eyes on the perpetrator.

305
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,260
To find out
if they are who they say they are.

306

[on phone] Hi, it's Michael.

Hey, Mike, it's Bri.

-Hey, how are you doing?
-I'm good.

Look, I need your help with a surveillance
case. Are you available?

00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,611
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

311
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,363
So, problem is
we have to find this guy first. [laughs]

312
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,241
We don't know where he is.
So you got something to write with?

313
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,785
-I'm ready.
-All right. Perfect.

314
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,662
So his name is Todd Dean.

We have work to do.

what we can find on this guy.

318
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,050

319
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,010
I'll find his Facebook page.

When I get a new case in,
my primary goal is discovery.

321
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,769
On LinkedIn he has
over, like, 500-plus connections.

322
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,732
[Brianne] I wanna know
everything I possibly can about a suspect.

323
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,526
What's their online presence?

324
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,113
Who are their contacts?
Who are their associates?

325
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,158
He has his position
like CEO and founder of Sanjara Wellness.

00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,409
The charismatic leader

327
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,079
with a tremendous network of friends
and business associates.

328
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,081
"A proven visionary and leader."

00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,542
-He sounds like a big shot.
-Yeah.

330
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,211

[Brianne] Oh look, we have videos of him.

332
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,551
[Todd] People today are struggling,
with their issues, with their families,

333
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,471
with their jobs, with addictions,
with mental health, with stress.

334
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:05,727
And they're looking for a place
of peace and solutions and results.

335
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,897
Sanjara Experience represents that.

336
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,778
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Fan.

337
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,781
This has been
one of the most amazing experiences.

338
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,034
Eastern philosophies,
some new ways of handling folks,

339
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,703
helping them live their best lives.

340
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,915
The world needs a place like Sanjara.
It will be unlike anything else.

341
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,961
Creating an environment and the curricula.

342
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,381
People's lives are gonna be changed
being a part of it,

343
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,091
so can't wait to be a part.

344
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,259
[Cecilie] Wow.

345
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,471
So many professionals
and doctors and psychologists.

346
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,976
All of these really big people that
are giving these amazing testimonials.

347
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,977
Yeah.

348
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,148
I think for sure we need to talk to some
of these people, figure out who they are.

349
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,400
[line ringing]

350
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,235
Hi, my name is Brianne.

351
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,614
I'm a private investigator,
and I'm investigating Todd Dean.

352
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,659
I am doing an investigation
into Todd Dean and Sanjara Wellness.

353
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,079
I got your name
from a promotional video that I watched,

354
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,374
and I wanted to ask you
a few questions about Sanjara.

355
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,418
[male] Sorry, I think you have
the wrong number.

356
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,921
[Brianne] Give me a call back, please.

357
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,963
Another no hit.

358
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,507
[Cecilie] No one is answering.

359
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,426
-[Brianne] No?
-[Cecilie] It just drops.

360
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,304
[line ringing]

361
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,481
Hi, Josh. My name is Brianne.

362
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:37,152
I'm a private investigator,
and I'm investigating Todd Dean.

363
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,281
I think your company
created the video for Sanjara?

364
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,492
[Josh] Yeah, I shot that back in 2021.

365
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,577
[Brianne] Okay, perfect.

366
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,998
[Josh] The video was really supposed to be
for investors, for funding.

367
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,835
He was, like, more of the CEO type of guy.

368
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,546
He brought the people
to try to make it work.

369
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,633
The professionals,
did they appear really genuine?

370
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,301
[Josh] For the most part, yeah.

371
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,596
Um, they really talked
about their fields of study

372
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,432
and how they would want
to utilize it in Sanjara.

373
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,936
A lot of them, I guess, were just trying
to see how this would work out.

374
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,189
[Brianne] What was your opinion
of Todd Dean when you first met him?

375
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,691
[Josh] He was different.

376
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,738
He was charming, and he was pretty flirty
with quite a few women there.

377
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,494
To be honest, the whole thing was weird.
Like, it really did feel kind of cultish.

378
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,332
Okay, one last question.
How did you get involved in this project?

379
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,085
[Josh] Through Sheena.
She is Todd's assistant.

380
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,630
She reached out to me.
She, like, ran the show.

381
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
[Brianne] Okay.
What was Sheena's last name?

382
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,386
-[Josh] I can't think of it right now.
-You can't remember her last name? Okay.

383
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,305
[Josh] I haven't talked to her since.

384
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,558
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

385
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
Bye.

386
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,893
Finally.

387
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,813
Yes. Finally, somebody's willing to talk.

388
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,273
We need to find Sheena.

389
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,192
She's definitely someone
that we wanna talk to.

390
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,694
[intriguing music plays]

391
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,737
[chimes]

392
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,407
[chimes]

393
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:14,082
[Cecilie] Straight ahead.
Then to the left here.

394
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,919
So, our local P.I., Michael,
has a lead on Todd.

395
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,050
The thing about these leads is that
we have to act on them really quickly

396
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,886
because one minute they're here
and the next minute they're gone.

397
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,309
-[Brianne] Hey, Michael.
-How you doing?

398
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,312
-So, have you found our guy yet?
-We're working on it.

399
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,023
Yeah, there's a couple different things.
Here's his residence.

400
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,192
-[Brianne] It's an apartment complex?
-[Michael] Yeah.

401
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,027
Everyone's saying he lives there.

402
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,488
So, I've watched this residence a lot,

403
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,741
and I have never once seen him
come out of it, driving or walking.

404
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,618
I think, he's underground right now.

405
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,120
-He's avoiding as many people as possible.
-[Brianne] Okay.

406
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,791
[Michael] This picture where
he takes his hat off looks a lot like him,

407
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,085
but just not 100% yet.

408
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,212
So, we're still ironing it out.

409
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,632
It's that we've seen him both,
you know, bald, hair…

410
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,966
-[Brianne] Yeah.
-With a goatee.

411
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,177
I feel like sometimes
he can be a chameleon almost.

412
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,429
-[Michael] And he mixes it up.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

413
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,807
So, where's our best opportunity
to catch this guy?

414
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,393
[Michael] So, I would say
we need to focus on his poker playing.

415
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,353
We know that he likes to play poker,

416
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,814
but we haven't seen him
at many of the poker locations yet,

417
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,273
so we keep making the rounds.

418
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,819
But we have a tip
that he may be there tonight.

419
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,323
[Brianne] I think it'll be worthwhile
for us to set up some surveillance on him.

420
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,617
All right. Thank you so much.
See you soon, okay?

421
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,702
[tense music plays]

422
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,998
So, we're on this for 4.6 miles.

423
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,458
-[Brianne] Okay.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

424
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,090
-Like kind of to the right. Sorry.
-Continue where? To the right? Okay.

425
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,343
[Brianne] It's important
to get eyes on a perpetrator

426
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,179
because you want to establish
a pattern of behavior.

427
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,931
[Cecilie] Okay, here.

428
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,184
The intention is to get into their world.

429
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,773
Is that him? There? Brianne?

430
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,567
Do you see?

431
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,278
-[Brianne] That's not it. Not it.
-[Cecilie] Not him.

432
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,699
You have to be careful
because you wanna be discreet,

433
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,076
and you don't want your cover blown.

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,744
Maybe. [gasps]

435
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,122
Doesn't look the build.

436
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,668
-No.
-No, they're passing up the Acura.

437
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
[Brianne] Oh, look at that man.
He's looking at us.

438
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,636
-Who? Who?
-[Brianne] That guy. Well, maybe not.

439
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,638
He's curious. He's definitely curious.

440
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,018
Okay. [clears throat]

441
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,979
Is that Todd?

442
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,899
[Brianne] That's him.

443
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,486
-[Cecilie] It's him.
-[Brianne] Oh my God. Let's follow him.

444
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,571
[dramatic music plays]

445
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,286
-[Brianne] Keep your eyes on him.
-[Cecilie] Yeah, he's going.

446
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,538
Right, right, right

447
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,581
and right again.

448
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,957
-Yeah?
-Yep.

449
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,007
[Cecilie] There's the car
directly in front of us now.

450
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
He's driving fast.

451
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,596
-[Brianne] He's two cars in front of you.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

452
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,350
-[Brianne] He is way too far ahead up now.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

453
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,393
[Brianne] You can see his right mirror.

454
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
-See his mirror?
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

455
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,606
-Keep your eye on a piece of his car.
-[Cecilie] Okay.

456
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,109
[Brianne] Keep your eye on that.
We got a visual again, so it's good.

457
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,320
[Cecilie gasps] He's taking off.

458
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,906
-[Brianne] Scottsville, Franklin exit.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

459
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,869
It just looks a lot more countryside.

460
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,665
[Brianne] Keep your eyes on him
'cause I'm losing a blind spot.

461
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,464
[music fades]

462
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,509
[Brianne] I don't have a visual
of him at all. Do you?

463
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
[Cecilie] Yeah, we lost sight of him now.

464
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,268
Oh. [gasps]

465
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,649
[Brianne] What's the numbers on there?

466
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,861
[Cecilie] Yeah, that's him.

467
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
-[Brianne] Okay, look at that.
-[Cecilie] It's Sanjara.

468
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,074
It's Sanjara.

469
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
[soft music plays]

470
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,251
[Jill] We would go to Sanjara
several times a week

471
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,089
because I would help him mow
and do yard work.

472
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,384
We were getting along wonderfully,

473
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:40,765
but then…
he completely ended the relationship.

474
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,809
[somber music plays]

475
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,978
[Jill] I mean, I was heartbroken.

476
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,772
I just wasn't expecting it.

477
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,570
I felt like it was the end

478
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:57,907
until he started texting me again
saying, "Come back."

479
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,828
I'm thinking, well,
maybe he's changed his mind.

480
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,790
He just started
the relationship right back up.

481
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
Everything was the same.

482
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,088
Except now I felt like
I was walking on eggshells,

483
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,966
feeling very insecure
and not good about myself.

484
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,803
[Cecilie] They reel you in
with love and attention.

485
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,640
Once you're hooked,
they will unexpectedly pull away.

486
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,059
Suddenly you're the one
chasing their love and affection,

487
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,186
and that's the power shift that they want.

488
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,104
You're not thinking straight.

489
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,190
That's when they can get
even more money from you.

490
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,900
[foreboding music plays]

491
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,069
He wasn't physically abusing me,

492
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,572
but, I mean, there was
some sort of mental abuse going on.

493
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,243
You know you're not acting yourself
with me this morning.

494
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,953
Just saying, something's going on.

495
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:50,293
I think that I was trying to hang on
to any thread of relationship

496
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,711
that there could be there,

497
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,297
which also essentially put me into,

498
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,009
I think, anything that he would ask for,
I would do.

499
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Then, at one point,

500
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,059
he was telling me that he needed money
for the mortgage of Sanjara Wellness.

501
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:10,105
They increased the mortgage this month,
which I didn't realize, so it's, uh…

502
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,650
The only thing that I could think of
at that time

503
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,611
was taking money out of my retirement,

504
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,490
and I was able to get him $12,500.

505
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,868
[music fades]

506
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,412
His reaction was…

507
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,127
You know, he was more so disappointed
that he would have liked to have had more.

508
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,754
[gentle music plays]

509
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,592
I had been dating Todd for almost a year,

510
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,679
and he was getting pretty desperate
for money.

511
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,723
You feel like sending me $25?

512
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,644
But, at that point,
I gave him everything that I had.

513
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,774
I needed to borrow money to pay
my mortgage because I'd given it to Todd.

514
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,154
So he asked if there was any way
I could ask my daughter to give him money,

515
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,905
and at that time she was 17.

516
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,577
[sniffles]

517
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,247
I told him no. [sobs]

518
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,707
But…

519
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,586
I didn't have control over it,
and I'm just thankful for that

520
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,505
because I don't know
what I would have done

521
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,550
if I would've been in control of it.

522
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,844
And that scares me.

523
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,434
It just shows to you
that he will take money from anyone.

524
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,482
I realized, "Oh my gosh, I cannot believe
that I've fallen for this man."

525
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,027
Finally, I got to a point
that enough was enough.

526
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,153
And I was done.

527
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,284
That was the end of any type
of communication or relationship

528
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,619
that I had with Todd.

529
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,579
I was finished.

530
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,460
[intriguing music plays]

531
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,215
[Brianne] Now that we've got eyes on Todd,

532
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,677
we need to see if there's anyone else
that could substantiate Jill's claims.

533
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,305
According to Josh,

534
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,266
the cameraman
for Sanjara's promotional video,

535
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,143
there's a woman named Sheena.

536
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,687
She's supposedly his "personal assistant."

537
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,858
We need to find her.
She might have some inside information.

538
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,902
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-[Brianne] Yeah.

539
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
[Brianne] Which one is our Sheena?

540
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,369
Oh, you know, there's a million Sheenas.
Like, really?

541
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,162
[Cecilie] Finding a needle in a haystack.

542
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,872
-[Brianne] Absolutely.
-[Cecilie] Oh yeah.

543
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,129
[phone dialling]

544
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,090
[Brianne] The number is disconnected.

545
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,591
The call failed.

546
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,801
[phone dialling]

547
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,511
[Brianne] Another no-answer.

548
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,014
Oh, look, look, look.

549
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,225
I found her.

550
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,227
I got her.

551
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,480
Yes! Oh, it's absolutely her. Look.

552
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,401
Look. "Executive assistant
at Sanjara Wellness."

553
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,111
[Cecilie] Sanjara Wellness. Yes.

554
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,405
[Brianne] And she's got pictures
at Sanjara.

555
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,406
[Cecilie] Oh, yeah.

556
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,492
[line ringing]

557
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,953
[Brianne clears throat, hums]

558
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,414
[woman] Hi.

559
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,291
Hi, is this Sheena?

560
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,710
[Sheena] It is.

561
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,921
My name is Brianne.
Do you know a Todd Dean?

562
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,548
[Sheena] I do, yeah.

563
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,886
[soft music plays]

564
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,936
Sheena is out of the country.
Good Lord, Sheena.

565
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,568
Oh, looks like
we're approaching something.

566
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,819
[knocks on door]

567
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,989
-Hi. Yes.
-[Brianne] Sheena?

568
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,533
-Hi, I'm Brianne. May I come in?
-It's Brianne?

569
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,035
-Come on in.
-[Brianne] Thank you.

570
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,787
-Oh, you've got a little baby.
-[Sheena] Yes. How are you?

571
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
[Brianne] I'm doing well.

572
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,167
Are these your kids as well?

573
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,713
Yeah, so that's…
I have actually three girls and four boys.

574
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,841
Look, I can only imagine
what breakfast looks like around here.

575
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,427
I have two, so I know
my hands are always full with two.

576
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,845
I can't imagine.

577
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,766
Well, thank you again for, um, agreeing
to meet with me on such short notice.

578
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,976
-I really appreciate that.
-My pleasure.

579
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,853
I'm investigating Todd Dean.

580
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,440
And just trying to find out
a little bit more information about him.

581
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,859
-Yeah.
-And Sanjara in general.

582
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,695
-Okay.
-Um… How do you know Todd?

583
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,698
I just happened
to be scrolling on Facebook,

584
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,285
and in one of the Nashville groups,
there was a post.

585
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,913
It said,
"I need part-time office assistant."

586
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,999
-[Brianne] Okay.
-And it happened to be Todd Dean.

587
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,001
So I did a phone interview,

588
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,922
and within a couple of hours,
he was like, "I wanna hire you."

589
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,883
-[Brianne] Okay.
-And I was like, "Okay, perfect."

590
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,719
Tell me, what exactly is Sanjara?

591
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,139
What it is and what it's supposed to be
are two different things.

592
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,519
-Okay.
-It was a wellness experience.

593
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:04,190
It's where people would go
to kind of get their bearings back.

594
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:09,112
But when we started talking about
the finances of Sanjara as a business,

595
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,281
that's when I realized
it wasn't exactly what I thought it was.

596
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:16,619
[inhales] I started questioning, like,
how were we gonna pay things

597
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,830
and do things if there's no money?

598
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,207
-Right.
-And so he started showing me…

599
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,920
"Well, I just get money from investors."
It was like, "What are they investing in?"

600
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,922
And he's like, "Sanjara."

601
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,551
And I was like,
"So they're investing in an idea." And…

602
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,761
Don't ever say that to him. He hates that.

603
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,180
-Because to him, Sanjara is real.
-Yeah.

604
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,183
-But it's never opened.
-Oh wow. Okay.

605
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,478
-It seems like scamming is what it is.
-That is scamming.

606
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,439
Especially with a business
that's not even open.

607
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,941
-Where are you spending the money?
-Right.

608
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,194
I did eventually gain access
to bank accounts and stuff like that,

609
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,114
and I would question,
"Well, where is the money going?"

610
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:57,368
-"We had $50,000 four days ago."
-Yeah.

611
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,413
And now we're scrambling
because we have $500.

612
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,125
Yeah. And did you ever get any answers?

613
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,668
We actually had disagreements

614
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:10,757
about personal transactions
going through the business account.

615
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,217
Every penny of that investor money

616
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,012
should be going
into rehabbing the building.

617
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,892
So, obviously,
he was getting money from investors.

618
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,477
Quote, unquote, "Investors."

619
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,857
But what about personal loans
or donations from other people?

620
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,526
Were there just girlfriends, maybe?

621
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,571
Was he getting money
from people like that as well?

622
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,530
Absolutely.

623
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,116
Prior to me coming on board with him,

624
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,745
he had apparently borrowed
some money from mostly women.

625
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,538
And they were private loans.

626
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,125
-So there was, uh, Karen.
-Okay.

627
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,881
And after I came on board with him,
we got Jill.

628
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,593
There was several of them I know of.

629
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,888
-Have you talked to any of these women?
-No.

630
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:04,435
Do you recall, um, like, how much money
he was getting just out of these women?

631
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:10,233
So, we were bringing in
anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 a month.

632
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,443
-Wow. And from investors?
-From investors.

633
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,653
Okay.

634
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,905
Do you have any, like, documents,

635
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,992
or any kind of documentation of any
of these things regarding him financially?

636
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,077
Yeah.

637
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,040
-And so these are the checking accounts.
-Okay.

638
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
-Oh, okay.
-For the business.

639
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,294
So this is one of our bridge loans.

640
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,255
-It's a 50,000.
-Okay.

641
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:39,220
And then we would just have all these,
like, $22, $10, $21, $50, $31.

642
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,597
When he transfers them
to his personal account…

643
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,309
Wow. So there are
several transactions like this?

644
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,478
-Mm-hmm.
-[Brianne] Girl, this man…

645
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,397
[Sheena] "ATM withdrawal, $1,000."

646
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,774
-Yeah, straight to his personal account.
-Yeah.

647
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,569
They were investing
in the promise of helping other people

648
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,028
with mental health wellness.

649
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,282
He always preyed on the people that…

650
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,783
-Were vulnerable.
-Yeah.

651
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,166
[Sheena] It felt like he was
turning Sanjara into a hunting ground.

652
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,878
So he could find
all of the vulnerable women

653
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,630
because that's what he was looking for.

654
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,306
[line ringing]

655
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,641
[Cecilie] Hello?

656
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,020
Cecilie, we have the smoking gun.

657
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,482
Sheena thinks Sanjara is a scam.

658
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,490
She thinks that he used Sanjara
to take advantage of vulnerable women.

659
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,453
-To manipulate them and take their money.
-That's disgusting.

660
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,374
We have bank statements
that could potentially show

661
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:55,254
that the money that he received
from Sanjara went straight to his pockets.

662
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm very fucking angry.

663
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,093
[Brianne] Sheena mentioned
someone named Karen from Idaho.

664
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,929
She may be another victim.

665
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,640
I have her details.
I need you to go talk to her.

666
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,726
[Cecilie] I think this is what is needed.

667
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,520
[dramatic music plays]

668
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:16,943
[Cecilie] Hi!

669
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,404
-Hi. Cecilie, hi! I'm Karen.
-Karen. So nice to meet you.

670
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,658
-Can I give you a hug?
-Yes, come on in. I'm holding the door.

671
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,078
-What a place. Yeah.
-Make yourself comfortable. Thank you.

672
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,621
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

673
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,751
So, if you can just take me back then.
I just know that you knew Todd.

674
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,005
When I met him,
it was years before Sanjara.

675
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,219
I was in Sun Valley skiing,
and he jumped on the lift with me.

676
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,513
We chatted.

677
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,809
He asked where I was from
and what did I do and was I married.

678
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,727
And he seemed nice enough.

679
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:57,191
So we finished skiing,
and we walked into the lodge and, um.

680
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,320
Right away it seemed like he knew people.
People were drawn to him.

681
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,824
Yeah. What is it about him?
Kind of like you were just…

682
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:11,122
He was really charming,
and there's a… a charisma there.

683
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,043
He told me that he was from Seattle
and he was an entrepreneur.

684
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,630
He said that he had a house
in Sun Valley right on the river

685
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,590
but he also had his condo in Seattle.

686
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,429
I lived in Sun Valley for a long time
as a second home.

687
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,265
So I knew that was not the kind of place
you would hang out

688
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,641
if you didn't have any money.

689
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,687
-Yeah.
-He seemed to be a successful businessman.

690
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,233
He said he was working on
all these different investment projects.

691
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,697
And that seemed pretty exciting to me.
And so, the first time it was like…

692
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,824
Hey, do you wanna…

693
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,118
-Maybe you wanna get in on this.
-Hmm.

694
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,746
Like, maybe--
Like he was doing me a favor.

695
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,875
-Like, this is not open to everybody but…
-Wow, that's interesting. That is.

696
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,962
"If you want, I could probably get you in
for maybe, like, $5,000."

697
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,423
-I was like, "Okay, I could do that."
-Mm.

698
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,468
-There were a couple of those projects.
-Okay.

699
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,511
That were really small startups that--

700
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,014
I mean, he wasn't asking me for $100,000.

701
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,640
But they were all little ones.

702
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,809
And they started adding up.

703
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,562
There was a point
that I started feeling like,

704
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:22,693
"This is… doesn't smell right to me."
And I started keeping track of everything.

705
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,570
All of a sudden,

706
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,782
you know, all the red flags
that I had pushed down into the sand,

707
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,368
I looked back and all I saw was red.

708
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:35,122
That was when I knew
I had in fact been scammed.

709
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,208
[curious music plays]

710
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,796
[Karen] For some reason,
he agreed to sign this document

711
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,175
that admits and acknowledges
that he owes me the money.

712
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:51,639
Here, there it is. $24,920.

713
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,352
What I think is that he agreed to sign it

714
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,772
because he felt
it would make him look legit.

715
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,901
He did pay a few times. Then he defaulted.

716
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,154
I said to my lawyer, "What do I do?"
He said, "You can either let it go,

717
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,573
or you can now
file the default judgment."

718
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
"Then that's a permanent court record."

719
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,997
As soon as that judgment was filed,
that was when I started getting contacted

720
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,791
by people who were searching him

721
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,420
to see if he was legit,
and that's how it really started.

722
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,922
How many victims are there in this?

723
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,840
There's so many.

724
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,511
What I would love from you,
if you would be willing,

725
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,264
is to give a statement
about your experience.

726
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,516
And put me in touch with the other women.

727
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,559
Of course.

728
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,936

[chimes]

731
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:53,659
[Brianne] The police historically
don't take these cases seriously.

732
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,036
So it's on us to make it airtight.

733
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,168
Our challenge is to prove
that they're not alone

734
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,963
in what they're accusing this person of.

735
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:13,137
If we can corroborate their stories
and show a clear pattern of behavior,

736
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,639
that'll help us prove
that Todd is a fraudster.

737
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,557
Hi.

738
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,976
Hi, there you are.

739
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,436
-Hi.
-My God.

740
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,522
-Hi, wonderful to meet you.
-You too.

741
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,026
We're doing now
an investigation into Todd Dean.

742
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,653
He makes himself look real good, right?

743
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:35,910
Oh, CEO of Sanjara.
Charming, handsome, very professional.

744
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:41,207
He started sending me texts
every single day, multiple times a day.

745
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,920
He flatters you to death,
makes you feel like a million dollars.

746
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,964
"You are so, so beautiful.
You are so, so pretty."

747
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:55,513
He preys on women who are newly
out of a really tough breakup or divorce.

748
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
I had just gotten out of a divorce.

749
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,062
I was in the process
of ending a very toxic relationship.

750
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,358
He'll ask you those questions
about mental health and trauma

751
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,777
to really bring down your guard,

752
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,738
um, and make you
even more vulnerable to him, right?

753
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
He didn't want me to think for myself.

754
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,827
It was more like, I want to control you.

755
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,706
Then he built his trust by grooming them,
and then he asked for the money.

756
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,963
He called me up, like, in desperation,
saying that he needed money.

757
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,632
It was only going to be for like 48 hours.

758
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,386
He texted me in the morning.
I thought, "Oh great, a text from Todd."

759
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,181
Instead it was a request for $10,000.

760
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,310
I wired him $10,000 with the understanding
that he would pay it back.

761
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,062
within 48 hours.

762
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
Never once did he even try to pay me back.

763
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,737
Would you be willing to give a statement
on your experience with him?

764
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,074
Yeah, there's no accountability
that's been placed on him yet.

765
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,951
[Theresa] 100%, yes.

766
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,329
If he is not stopped

767
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,207
by the police, by the judicial system,

768
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,418
he will continue this.

769
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,046
[Brianne] This is serious stuff.
He's done this with so many women.

770
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,549
It's clearly his MO.
This is how he operates.

771
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,430
He needs to be stopped. Like, he can't
keep getting away with this.

772
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,435
[Brianne] Criminals think, "I got away
with it once. I'll do it again."

773
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,854
And they feel untouchable.

774
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,692
So what's helpful in cases like this
is establishing whether or not

775
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,653
the perpetrator is currently engaging

776
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,032
in criminal activity
and defrauding someone.

777
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,870
Because if they are,
the police are more likely to act quickly.

778
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,956
This could really help
make or break a case.

that a lot of women were fragile.

A lot of women did struggle
with self-esteem and self-confidence.
