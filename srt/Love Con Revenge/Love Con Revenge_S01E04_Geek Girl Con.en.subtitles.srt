00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,093
[tense music plays]

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,271
I am Dorian Wilkerson,
a doctor in epidemiology.

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:26,067
I am a father,
husband, and a business owner.

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,531
[Cecilie] What impresses people
are occupations that we can trust.

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:37,996
We see time and time again
that fraudsters will then try to pretend

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,458
that they're doctors
or successful businessmen.

7
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,129
The Best U Now is one of the very few

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,340
Black-owned plastic surgery centers
in South Florida.

9
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,510
No one else down in South Florida
that is Black-owned

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,180
with the same type of certifications.

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,685
[Cecilie] These are people that we imagine
to be smart and sophisticated.

12
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,687
"I can trust this person."

13
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,773
And they exploit that.

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,861
[Brianne] So, here's what we know.
He was not a licensed medical doctor.

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,364
We know that there was
a cease and desist put out for him.

16
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,407
That's huge.

17
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,367
This is insanity to me.

18
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,790
It's time to tell Shareza
what we've discovered about Dorian's lies.

19
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,257
Hello. Hi, I'm Brianne Joseph,
private investigator. Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,383
[Shareza] Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,262
This has got to be a very traumatic
experience for you, right?

22
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,389
-It's a lot. It's a lot.
-[Brianne] Yeah.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,267
-Is there anywhere we can sit?
-[Shareza] We can go outside.

24
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,103
[Brianne] We're gonna
just jump right into it.

25
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,898
We've done some digging on Dorian,
and this might be hard for you to hear,

26
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,526
but he was never
a licensed medical doctor.

27
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,362
[Cecilie] We contacted Emory directly.

28
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,989
-It's all a lie.
-What he's put up is a lie.

29
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,158
No. No.

30
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,205
He has degrees. Like, I saw the diplomas.

31
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,667
As a matter of fact,
he has diplomas in the office, in his…

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,503
He would… He had them hung up
in his office on the wall.

33
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,422
Yeah, that's part of the smoke and mirrors
of all of this.

34
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,340
Wow.

35
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:17,846
In 2017, we found out the state of Florida
issued a cease and desist for him.

36
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,472
[melancholy music plays]

37
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,099
Did you know about that?

38
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:26,604
He told me that his ex-girlfriend
called the state of Florida on him.

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,816
-And said he wasn't licensed in Florida.
-Yeah.

40
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,362
There was a lot of things
that she was doing and posting online.

41
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,907
There was, like, a vendetta.
He said it was completely untrue.

42
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,912
When you're in a marriage with someone,
you are going to trust them at their word.

43
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,792
-I didn't think he was lying at that time.
-No.

44
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,378
-[Cecilie] And I think that is…
-[Brianne] Yeah.

45
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,131
…what is terrible about this.

46
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,051
To find out that all this was
just a sham and a lie, and…

47
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,971
-[Brianne] Yeah.
-I feel like, you know, I feel betrayed.

48
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,515
-Absolutely.
-It's really hurtful.

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,351
Like, I was literally sleeping
with the enemy.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,980
Like, I was sleeping next
to someone who I didn't even know.

51
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,857
I feel disgusted.

52
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,109
-'Cause it goes deep.
-[Shareza] Yeah.

53
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,404
-It goes to the consent of a relationship.
-[Shareza] Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,322
It's tough.

55
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,741
You know, if it wasn't for my family
and my close friends,

56
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,284
I don't know where I would be.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,369
[melancholy music continues]

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,041
[Cecilie] A lot of the times we talk
about consent when it comes to intimacy.

59
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:32,128
In these cases, it's like,
do you actually know this person?

60
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,715
And that right to that consent
is being taken away from you.

61
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:40,720
You have no idea who this individual is
'cause they've lied about everything.

62
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,352
I mean, I want him in jail.
I want him in jail.

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,315
I want him to be held accountable
and pay for what he's done.

64
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,776
We will back you 100%.

65
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,071
We are working for you, girl.
We've got your back.

66
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,323
[dramatic music plays]

67
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,412
[Brianne] We wanted proof
Dorian lied to Shareza

68
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,624
to get her to take out the loans,
which we have.

69
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,877
But it's hard
to get these cases investigated,

70
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,506
particularly when you're married
and you run a business together.

71
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,302
We need to find others
who can corroborate Shareza's story,

72
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,887
to help us strengthen the case.

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,973
[keyboard clacking]

74
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,897
I am now looking at different reviews

75
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,650
that has been made on Best U Now.

76
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,991
What I can see from one of the reviews,
it's a doctor mentioned here with Dorian.

77
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,368
They must have worked together
at the clinic.

78
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,248
If this doctor would be willing
to speak to us, that would be amazing.

79
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,835
He may be able to provide
further evidence of Dorian's lies.

80
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,256
[tense music plays]

81
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,184
[Cecilie] Hi, Brianne.
I heard back from Dr. Tim.

82
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,730
He's agreed to talk.
Can you meet me at the hotel?

83
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,567
[Brianne] Hi, Dr. Tim. How are you?

84
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
-Good. How are you today?
-[Brianne] Good.

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:24,073
Can you tell us a bit about when you
started working with the cosmetic clinic?

86
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,784
I was there for about two years.

87
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,996
I left kind of abruptly.
On not-so-great terms.

88
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
What was your impression of Dorian
when you first met him?

89
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,210
Very charming. Very smart guy.

90
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,129
What's your impression of him now?

91
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,589
Worse.

92
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,553
He was very, very keen on cutting costs
and cutting corners everywhere he could,

93
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,432
which is one of the big, uh, problems
I had with him.

94
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,226
I was supposed to be paid on Fridays.

95
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,188
He just frequently…
just never showed up on Fridays.

96
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,522
This wasn't just me.

97
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,693
This was other doctors.
And so this is how he ran his practice.

98
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,363
What was your impression of Shareza?

99
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,240
How much of a part of the clinic was she?

100
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,911
Um, you know,
she was there every once in a while.

101
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,581
But she wasn't primarily involved
with Best U Now.

102
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,376
She fronted the money.
That's what I was told.

103
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,587
Did he do any procedures
on any of the patients himself?

104
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,631
No, no. He didn't go that route.

105
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,509
He wore his lab coat and he wore
his stethoscope around his neck.

106
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
And I can guarantee,
he didn't know which end went in his ears.

107
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,679
What was his job there?

108
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,265
He was the practice manager.

109
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,143
He's the one
who was responsible for hiring and firing.

110
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,021
But he didn't know
how to run a medical practice.

111
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,399
He cut corners
so he could make more money

112
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,860
and, uh, keep his expenses down,
and somebody paid the ultimate price.

113
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,365
-[Tim] After the death of that patient…
-[Brianne] Death? Did you say a death?

114
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,324
[Tim] Death.

115
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,620
A death. An anesthetic-related death.

116
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,290
Patient was being cared for

117
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,627
at the end of the table by somebody
totally unqualified in anesthesia.

118
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,003
And they died.

119
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,174
Oh my God.
I cannot believe somebody actually died.

120
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,634
Oh my God.

121
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,221
These people…

122
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,433
They were not qualified
to do what they were doing.

123
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,396
And now we actual…
We have an actual death there.

124
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,356
-Yeah.
-[Cecilie] That is horrendous.

125
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,608
[Tim] It's infuriating, frustrating.

126
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,320
You know, things were just chaotic
from the top down.

127
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,406
So he's done a lot of bad stuff.

128
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,701
You know, he's a real charmer,
but very much a liar.

129
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,786
[foreboding music plays]

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,998
[Shareza] The death
still kind of haunts me.

131
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,710
It's very difficult to talk about, um…

132
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,632
Because it was Dorian's little cousin.

133
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,179
Like, this young girl was around
the same age as my daughters.

134
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,475
She was a mother.
She had two children. Um…

135
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,937
During her surgery,

136
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,525
there were some complications
that caused her pulse to drop.

137
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:11,616
Um, she was taken to the local hospital
where she was pronounced dead.

138
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,701
[melancholy music plays]

139
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,705
[Shareza] There was an investigation
by the Florida Department of Health.

140
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,209
And they've stated that
the cause was the anesthesia.

141
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:26,797
And the doctor that performed the surgery
was held liable, not the clinic.

142
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,302
This was a doctor
that, um, was hired by Dorian.

143
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,805
And he said,

144
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,767
"Damn, this is really
gonna affect the business now."

145
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:45,107
And I'll never forget that.
Like, it was just so, like, so cold.

146
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,903
He was so unbothered.
You know, he didn't care.

147
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,239
You know, this is family.

148
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,699
And he did not go to the hospital.

149
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,537
All he cared about was losing business.

150
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,874
This is when I really
started questioning my marriage.

151
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,547
That death really impacted me
more than I… thought.

152
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,008
I'm… I'm not over it.
You know, I still think about it.

153
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,678
I still think about, um, her.

154
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
[tense music plays]

155
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,106
[Cecilie] She doesn't even know the man
that she was married to.

156
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,651
It's heartbreaking, you know, for her.

157
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,362
'Cause it's many years that she wasted.

158
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,864
And he took so much from her.

159
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,201
I am so angry.
There's no repercussions, nothing.

160
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,454
I think he really thinks
that he got away now.

161
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,707
We need to find him.

162
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,252
[music intensifies]

163
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,092
[Brianne] We don't know where Dorian is.

164
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,803
It's super important
we get eyes on this guy.

165
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,890
If he's still pretending
to be a medical doctor,

166
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,226
the police might act more urgently.

167
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,065
Mindy is my investigator
that's here on the ground in Atlanta.

168
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,485
I asked her to dig up anything
and everything she could.

169
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,490
Hey, Min, what you got?

170
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,786
[Mindy] So some of the documents,
I was able to find an address.

171
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,330
And it's a home address.

172
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,041
You found a home address on him?

173
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,295
[Mindy] It was as recent as April.
This is good. And this is recent.

174
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,090
[Brianne] Can you send me the address?
I need to see where this guy is at.

175
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,146
Hey, Cee, so I'm gonna explain to you
what we're doing this morning.

176
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,940
We're gonna set up surveillance on Dorian.

177
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,987
The setup is not ideal for me.
There's no street parking here.

178
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,741
So we can't-- We can't get close
to this guy's house at all.

179
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,952
So we're gonna have a spotter to say,
"Hey, he's coming your way."

180
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,622
Then we'll get the heads-up
and get behind him.

181
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,583
Okay. If we then track him,
what's the plan then?

182
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,295
Hopefully, we can follow him
and figure out maybe he's going to work.

183
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,423
-[Cecilie] Yep.
-Maybe he's setting up another scam.

184
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,301
Is he still pretending
to be a medical doctor?

185
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,346
So it's just about us getting intel
about his activities.

186
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,395
[music fades]

187
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,356
[Brianne] Hey, uh, when Dorian leaves, uh,

188
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,567
go ahead and follow behind him
as you give us the heads-up.

189
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,861
[Mindy] Copy that, will do.

190
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,240
[Brianne] We wanna make sure we don't
give him an opportunity to burn us.

191
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,950
[tense music plays]

192
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,870
[Brianne] Surveillance requires
a lot of patience. It's a waiting game.

193
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,999
[Cecilie] I'm just so curious
to what he's up to.

194
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,752
[Brianne] Came all the way to Atlanta
for what?

195
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,671
-[Mindy] I have him.
-[Cecilie] Oh.

196
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,757
[Mindy] Confirmed, it's him.
It's his license plate.

197
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,970
Definitely came
whipping around that corner.

198
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,763
Black Cadillac SUV.

199
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,101
[Brianne] That… That was him.
Copy. He's directly in front of me.

200
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,197
[Cecilie] Oh, he's doing a U-turn.
Does he know he's being followed?

201
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,366
[Brianne] I'm doing a U-turn too.

202
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,202
It's risky, but I can't lose him.

203
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,583
All right, guys.
He's going into Chick-fil-A parking lot.

204
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,295
So just meet us at Chick-fil-A.
He's going through the drive-through.

205
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,632
All right,
he's coming back onto the road, guys.

206
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,970
Shit.

207
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,847
-Go!
-[Cecilie] Go, go, go.

208
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,890
Go, go, go.

209
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,059
[Cecilie] He is driving fast.

210
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,895
-[Brianne] He's very fast.
-[Cecilie] Wow.

211
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,482
[Brianne] He could be speeding
because he's just a speed demon,

212
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,401
or he could be aware
that he's being followed.

213
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,571
He's in the far-left lane.

214
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,033
I'm one car behind him.
Um, can you guys still see me?

215
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,204
-[Mindy] I don't have a visual on you, no.
-[Brianne] Oh shit.

216
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,207
Yeah, he's moving really fast.

217
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,126
You guys are gonna have to hit the gas
to catch up with us.

218
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,922
[Cecilie gasps] Oh no, he's…
He's taking over there.

219
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,342
Yeah, go with him. Go with him.

220
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,344
-[Cecilie] Follow him.
-Go with him. Go with him.

221
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,971
[Brianne] You got eyes on him?

222
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,850
-[Cecilie] Do you have eyes on him?
-[Mindy] I do. He got off on the right.

223
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,977
He almost got in an accident.

224
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,772
[Cecilie] Yeah, that was so dangerous.

225
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,982
[Mindy] Bri, do you copy?

226
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,901
[Brianne] Yeah, go ahead.

227
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,321
[Mindy] I've got him
going into Georgia State University.

228
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,114
Copy that. Thank you.

229
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,951
-He's going to Georgia State University.
-[Cecilie] Wow.

230
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,869
[Brianne] I wonder what he's doing there.

231
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,540
Okay. So, let's see
where his car's parked.

232
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,918
-Oh, I think I see it. It's right here.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

233
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,837
[Brianne] Yeah.
Looks like it's right here.

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,048
-[Brianne] You see it? Yeah, that's him.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

235
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,513
So, I'm gonna go in, take a look around,
and see if I can find him.

236
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,182
And if I do, I'll try to engage him
and see if he'll talk to me,

237
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,934
and see what he's doing in there.

238
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,229
-[Cecilie] Good luck.
-[Brianne] Yes, thank you. All right.

239
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,231
[intriguing music plays]

240
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,358
[Cecilie] Come on, Bri, you can do it.

241
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,121
[Brianne] I can see him.
He's coming this way.

242
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,801
-Hi, you work here?
-[Dorian] I do.

243
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,679
[Brianne] Where's building, um, CA?

244
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,017
-Oh gosh, now that part I don't.
-[Brianne chuckles]

245
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,478
-I thought you said you worked here.
-[Dorian] Yes, but in the math department.

246
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,396
How you like it?

247
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,107
[Brianne] I don't even go here.
I'm just meeting my sister here.

248
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,986
So she said CA. And I'm like,
I don't know where the hell CA is.

249
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,447
[Dorian] Yeah, jeez,
I wish I could help you.

250
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,783
[Brianne] Oh Lord. Oh well.
All right. Well…

251
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,660
[Dorian] Have a good lunch.
Enjoy your sister.

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,913
Dr. Wilkerson,
nice to meet you, and you are?

253
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,164
[Brianne] My name is Kim.

254
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,125
-[Dorian] Kim. Nice to meet you Kim.
-[Brianne] Yeah. It's a pleasure.

255
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,128
-[Dorian] Enjoy. You're beautiful.
-[Brianne] Oh, thank you.

256
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,713
I appreciate that. Bye.

257

[curious music plays]

258
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,142
[Brianne] So Dorian works here.

259
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,894
-Oh my gosh.
-[Brianne] Yes.

260
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,312
Great job, Bri.

261
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,982
I didn't expect him
to be employed at a university.

262
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,195
[Cecilie] It says here he has a PhD
in mathematics from Clark University.

263
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,156
[Brianne] We gotta let Shareza know
that he's here. Yeah.

264
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,742
-We're coming for him. Yeah.
-[Brianne] Absolutely.

265

268

[soft music plays]

269
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,811
-[Cecilie] Hi, Nykki.
-Hi.

270
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,728
-[Cecilie] Hi.
-Hi.

271
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,148
-Good to see you again. How are you?
-[Nykki] You too. I'm good.

272
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,526
[Cecilie] You wanted to talk to us?

273
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,487
[Nykki] Um, yeah.
So with everything that's going on…

274
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,366
We had to sell the house.
I had to go apartment hunting.

275
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,036
After finding some places
that I really liked, I got denied.

276
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,916
And I was like, that's not right.
My credit has plummeted tremendously.

277
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,961
After doing a little bit more research,

278
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,507
I noticed that there were open accounts
and loans that I'd never seen before.

279
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,554
It's my suspicion that
they were opened by my former stepdad.

280
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,808
I actually filed a police report.

281
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,312
And although I didn't get any further,
I have it here for you guys.

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,942
There are two accounts, $80,000,
that are in collections on her credit.

283
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,778
So $80,000 in debt in your name?

284
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah.

285
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,576
I know how he might have
got access to my information.

286
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,287
Um, there was one point
when he was super adamant

287
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,957
about getting all of our information
in one safe place.

288
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,085
And, you know, as a father figure,
as the head of the household…

289
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,504
-…at that time, it made sense.
-You trusted him.

290
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,008
What's crazy about this case now

291
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,802
is that it's like the entire family
he has targeted.

292
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,887
Yeah.

293
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,264
-It's mind-blowing to me.
-[Brianne] It's crazy, yeah.

294
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,727
He thinks I'm too weak
to do anything about it.

295
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,274
So I'd love the opportunity
to come face-to-face with him,

296
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,735
confront him, and get justice.

297
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,528
[ominous music plays]

298
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,909
We can facilitate that for you.

299
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,913
All right. I appreciate that, guys.

[soft music plays]

301
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,291
[Shareza] We are the Wilkersons!

302
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,670
My daughters were
extremely affected by this.

303
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,840
You know,
having their hearts broken as well.

304
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,010
To see them having
to go through this is tough.

305
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,264
That they had to endure this because of

306
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,183
my choice.

307
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,311
The fact that he infiltrated their lives,

308
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,439
is more disappointing
than him infiltrating mine.

309
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,275
Because those are, you know, my babies.

310
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,488
The fact that you now
have hurt my daughters

311
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,281
in this way,

312
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,619
you really need to pay for this.

00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,748
[dramatic music plays]

314
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,418
-[Cecilie] So today's the day.
-[Brianne] Yes.

315
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,381
And we really feel that it's time
for the victims now to speak up.

316
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,383
And I'm very grateful, Nykki,

317
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,554
that you want to meet him
and tell him exactly what he's done.

318
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,266
What exactly
would you like to say to Dorian?

319
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,272
I wanna tell him
that, um, he's been discovered completely.

320
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,484
And I know, we know, exactly who he is

321
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,112
and what his intentions were.

322
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,115
-[Brianne] That's very powerful, honestly.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

323
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,701
[Brianne] So, I did pre-surveillance
on Dorian.

324
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,162
We've already identified his pattern.

325
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:29,960
He typically would go into Building CD,
um, which is where his classes are held.

326
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,714
And he goes
into this building typically after 12:30.

327
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,592
We know what time he comes,
what time leaves.

328
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,011
So we have several opportunities

329
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,806
to put you guys in place to catch him
and say what you need to say to him.

330
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,727
I think it's really amazing
that Nykki's going to do this today.

331
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,813
To just be, you know, an advocate for us.

332
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,025
And not just for me, but getting closure.

333
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,694
Like, he needs to be stopped.
He can never--

334
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,405
We can never
let him do this to anyone else.

335
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,117
[tense music plays]

336
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,871
[Cecilie] How are we feeling?

337
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,498
I don't know. Anxious, angry.

338
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,377
Just ready to do it.

339
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,088
-[Brianne] It's about that time.
-[Cecilie] I know, let's do it.

340
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,970
[Jnyah] Say what you have to say,
and let him go about his business.

341
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,264
-This.
-[Nykki] Oh. Are we sitting here?

342
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,183
-Okay.
-[Jnyah] Be calm.

343
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,066
[music intensifies]

344
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,317
[Brianne] There he is.

345
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,866
-[Nykki] Okay, let's do this.
-[Jnyah] Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

346
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,250
[Nykki] I see him.

347
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,296
[Brianne] Mr. Wilkerson,
you have a minute?

348
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,507
[Cecilie] The girls want
to say something to you.

349
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,467
I just wanna know when it's gonna stop.

350
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,013
[Nykki] You came in our lives.
You came in our lives and destroyed it.

351
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,766
-[Cecilie] You're not an MD.
-[Jnyah] Never have been, never were.

352
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,476
[Cecilie] You're pretending
to be a doctor.

353
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,979
-Listen, this is my job.
-[Nykki] You stole.

354
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,648
I had your last name, and you cried.

355
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,942
[Jnyah] Changed your last name
for exactly what, though?

356
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,903
-That's what my whole thing is.
-[Nykki] Were the tears real?

357
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,864
The degrees were fake,
but were the tears real?

358
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,076
You know what you do.
You've been conning women.

359
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,412
We were the only family you've had.

360
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,040
We loved you genuinely.
You've stolen everything.

361
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,834
[Jnyah] Yeah, we cared about you. We did.

362
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,379
[Nykki] And you cried when we changed
our name. You put things in my credit.

363
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,673
-In your credit? That's a lie.
-[Nykki] Yes, absolutely.

364
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,217
The police-- Listen.
You know you're going to jail, right?

365
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,594
[Jnyah] He's gonna get in the car.
Just get him by the car.

366
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,681
You're going to jail.
I can promise you that.

367
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,226
[Jnyah] Good job.

368
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,687
-[Cecilie] That was amazing, Nykki.
-[Nykki] Oh my God.

369
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,107
[Brianne] No, she's fine.
They're safe. They're safe. It's over.

370
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,985
Let me get her. She's crying.

371
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,570
[Jnyah] Mommy's right here. Come.

372
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:06,325
-[Shareza] It's okay. It's okay.
-[Nykki sobs]

373
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,910
She was amazing. You did a good job.

374
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,412
[Cecilie] They were amazing.

375
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,747
It's okay.

376
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,916
-It's okay. You got the closure.
-You did a good job.

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,628
-[Nykki sniffles]
-We got him to run away like he was…

378
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,629
Like he did.

379
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,423
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

380
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,344
-Did I do good, though? Like…
-You did a great job.

381
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,762
[Brianne] You did amazing.

382
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,098
-My heart was pounding so fast.
-You did a really good job.

383
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,684
-[Brianne] You should be proud.
-Yeah, you did a great job.

384
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,895
[Brianne] That wasn't an easy thing to do.

385
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,397
But you didn't say it and walk away.
You stayed with him.

386
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,191
And you ran his ass off the campus.

387
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,193
-[Jnyah] He didn't know which way to go.
-No.

388
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,155
[melancholy music plays]

389
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,329
[Brianne] Are you ready to go
to the police to present this evidence?

390
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,081
[Nykki] Yes, I am.

391
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,967
[Brianne] I… I really hope
that the police look into this.

392
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,388
-[Cecilie] To have some proper evidence.
-[Brianne] Yeah.

393
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,057
[Cecilie] It's gonna
give her the confidence, you know?

394
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,687
Shareza invested in the business
under false pretenses

395
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,273
because Dorian misrepresented himself
as a doctor

396
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,651
from the very beginning
of their relationship.

397
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:33,286
Once all of this is finalized,
I can put this man 100% behind me.

398
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:38,625
And I can finally move on with my life,
you know, myself and my daughters.

399
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,169
And we can just get our happy back.

400
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,384
[Nykki] Hi. I need to speak to a detective
to file a police report.

401
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,636
[officer 1] Okay, um, what it is it about?

402
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,179
-[Nykki] Fraud.
-[officer 1] Fraud.

403
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,598
[officer 2] All right,
bring me up to speed then.

404
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,856
[melancholy music continues]

405
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,068
-[Brianne] Hi, ladies.
-[Nykki] Hi.

406
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,862
-[Cecilie] Hi.
-[Brianne] How y'all doing?

407
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,030
-[Nykki] Good.
-[Brianne] Good to see you.

408
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,785
-You feeling okay? I know it was a lot.
-Yeah.

409
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,163
But you handled it well.

410
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,748
One hundred percent.
I'm so proud of you guys.

411
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:25,380
I feel like I can officially move on,
after two years of suppressed emotions

412
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:30,093
and not knowing how I would react
encountering him again.

413
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,346
I think today was
the validation I needed to let go.

414
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,473
[Cecilie] Yeah.

415
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:41,146
I think for me, it's really just about
moving on with my life.

416
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,273
You know, closing this out.

417
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,735
But also, it's not just about me.

418
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,279
I pray that those that are afraid to talk,

419
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:54,826
you know, those that are afraid to share
what they've gone through,

420
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,870
understand they don't have to shut up.

421
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,166
[Cecilie] Shareza has been so brave
to share her story.

422
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,501
Even though in this case,

423
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,420
the police didn't take any action
against Dorian,

424
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,173
she has exposed him for what he is.

425
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,759
It's sometimes impossible,

426
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,845
even with an overwhelming
amount of evidence,

427
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,807
to get anyone to go to jail for this.

428
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:24,105
But, there's justice
in getting their faces out,

429
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,691
stopping them in their tracks,
that is what we're doing.

430
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,901
Cheers to you guys.

431
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,861
Yes, cheers.

434
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,176
[newsreader 1] Seattle has been rocked
after a woman, Sabrina Taylor,

435
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,679
has been arrested
for conducting a multi-year fraud scheme.

436
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,015
[newsreader 2] A woman has been
found guilty of scamming people

437
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,850
from the comic book scene in Seattle.

438
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,519
[newsreader 3] Taylor has pleaded guilty

439
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,814
to stealing more than $600,000
from acquaintances.

440
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,150
[dramatic music plays]

441
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,614
I have received a message
from a male victim, and his name is Aaron.

442
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,120
[Aaron] Hi Cecilie, my ex-girlfriend
Sabrina was convicted of fraud by the FBI.

443
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,750
It wasn't until I heard about the case
that I realized the scope of what she did.

444
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,044
She stole more than 100K from me.

445
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,963
She lied to me and deceived me.

446
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,299
It nearly destroyed my life.

447
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,885
Please, can you help me? Aaron.

448
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,974
It's extremely rare
that we have men coming forward

449
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,602
and wanting to speak on their experience.

450
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,150
From a societal standpoint,
a lot of men feel a lot more shame,

451
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,152
or blame themselves even more.

452
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,698
It's not just the financial loss,

453
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,077
it's the hit to their identity,
their pride, and the trust in themselves.

454

[clears throat]

455
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,914
[Cecilie] And because of that,
many stay silent.

456
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,881
Before I met Sabrina,
I was fairly inexperienced dating.

457
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,924
[soft music plays]

458
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,928
[Aaron] I'm a big nerd,
so I went to school to make video games.

459
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:24,726
And there wasn't a lot of options
for dating women.

460
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,648
My biggest thing I was looking for
in a girlfriend at that point,

461
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,984
was someone who was into
a lot of the same things that I was.

462
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,863
Video games, anime, just nerdiness.

463

[curious music plays]

464
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,870
[Aaron] I first met Sabrina

465
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,374
after responding to an online personal ad.

00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,710

468
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,130
[Aaron] Sabrina and I talked
for a few days.

469
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:59,260
And the following weekend,
we ended up having our first date.

470
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,890
I was very attracted to Sabrina
when we first met.

471
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,434
She was very lovely.

472
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,604
Had a big, bright smile.

473
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,482
She was very easy to talk to.

474
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,404
We had a lot in common.

475
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,366
Sabrina was working for anime conventions,

476
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,868
comic book conventions,

477
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,330
and that really cemented
my attraction to her.

478
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,295
When Sabrina and I met,
she was in her last semester or two

479
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,466
at the University of Washington,
finishing her double bachelor's,

480
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,137
and she also had an internship
for the Gates Foundation.

481
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,223
That, to me, was just so impressive.

482
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,353
She also had ambition
to go to med school and be a doctor.

483
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,441
I was extremely excited
to be dating someone with big goals.

484
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,317
She made me happy,

485
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,237
and I wanted to see
these dreams come true.

486
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,115
[music fades]

487
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,537
[doorbell chiming]

488
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,041
-Hi. Aaron, is it?
-[Aaron] Hello.

489
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,960
-[Cecilie] Can I give you a hug?
-Of course.

490
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,712
[Cecilie] Oh, thank you for meeting me.

491
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,381
-Thank you for coming out here.
-[Cecilie] Yeah. Thank you.

492
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:23,636
You're actually the first male victim
that I've ever spoken to in person.

493
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,555
-Really? Wow.
-Yeah.

494
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,099
I have to say,
I'm not super surprised by that.

495
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,268
It can really feel like
your masculinity is undermined

496
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,270
by getting taken advantage of like this.

497
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,523
The betrayal has really affected me
for a very long time.

498
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,525
-It still does, to some degree.
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

499
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,736
Did you fall in love with her quickly,
would you say?

500
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,945
Extremely.

501
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,946
[romantic music plays]

502
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,449
And it felt very soulmate-like.

503
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,450
Mm.

504
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,328
[chiming]

505
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,289
[Aaron] I think the first time
I told her that I loved her

506
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,460
was about a month or so in…
to the relationship.

507
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,961
[camera clicks]

508
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,465
[Aaron] We ended up moving in together
within a couple of months.

509
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,969
The speed at which she moved in
did feel fast at the time,

510
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,305
but I was really in love with her.

511
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,312
So once she moved in,
did things change in the relationship?

512
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,856
[Aaron] Because she was a student,

513
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,609
she wouldn't be able
to, you know, afford her rent.

514
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,278
I wanted to see her go through med school,

515
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,947
see her graduate.

516
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,449
I was covering all the groceries,
all the gas.

517
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,534
-Rent?
-[Aaron] Rent.

518
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,244
-Everything.
-[Aaron] Yeah, everything.

519
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,412
The idea was kind of like, you know, I'm…

520
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,374
I'm gonna support you now,
but the plan is med school.

521
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,085
So obviously, at some point,
you're gonna be able to…

522
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,672
you know, contribute equally,
at the very least.

523
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,716
It's around this time
Sabrina starts bringing up complaints

524
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,637
about back pain and headaches
and just general soreness

525
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,348
that didn't correlate
with an injury or anything.

526
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:56,187
So, it was just kind of out of nowhere
and coalesced into a MS diagnosis.

527
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,522
What?

528
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,357
-[Cecilie] Horrible disease.
-Yeah.

529
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,442
[melancholy music plays]

530
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,405
[Aaron] Sabrina came to me one day
and said that

531
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,032
she'd gotten some
test results from her doctor.

532
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,746
And she held my hand
and looked me in the eyes

533
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,250
and told me
that they had diagnosed her with MS.

534
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,295
That's what killed my dad's dad.

535
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,006
I knew that
it's only gonna get worse over time.

536
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,049
I was extremely upset.

537
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,176
It broke my heart.

538
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,929
But I wanted to do everything I could to…

539
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,225
be strong for her and support her.

540
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:40,106
We had all these hopes and dreams
of med school and…

541
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,568
a house and maybe kids and…

542
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,197
The MS diagnosis really

543
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,618
threw a lot of those dreams
out the window, honestly.

544
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:02,003
And how did that make you feel in regards
to kind of helping supporting her?

545
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,089
It definitely put a lot of pressure
on me, um, because I…

546
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:11,220
You know, I loved her. So I'm gonna…
have to step up even more

547
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,973
'cause we only have
a certain number of years

548
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,100
before this is gonna get really bad.

549
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,062
[suspenseful music plays]

550
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,649
[Aaron] After Sabrina was diagnosed
with MS,

551
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,486
a couple of months later, she lost her job
that was providing her health insurance.

552
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,532
I had to pay out of pocket for stuff,
for medications, for appointments.

553
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,995
I was spending
about 4 or 500 bucks a month,

554
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,580
just on medications.

555
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,833
I would take cash out and give it to her.

556
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:46,714
I asked her to show me the receipts,
but she would just make excuses.

557
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,842
And eventually, I learned to just not ask.

558
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:57,308
Because of the MS diagnosis,
she had difficulty getting a job

559
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,395
because she was
extremely limited physically.

560
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,648
We had newly limited financial means.

561
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,527
I asked her to help contribute
a little more a few times,

562
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,321
and it really didn't go over well.

563
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,785
Basically, you know,
accused of not believing her illnesses

564
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,704
or her limitations on working.

565
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:22,500
So the onus came back on me
to provide everything.

566
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,630
On top of all of the medical stuff,
she was a very impulsive shopper.

567
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:35,805
She would go to high-end makeup stores
and buy hundreds of dollars of makeup.

568
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,307
Clothing stores,

569
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,060
and buy clothes every month.

570
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,982
I was doing whatever I could
to make sure she never felt the pinch

571
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:50,069
'cause she was gonna have
this significantly shorter life.

572
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:56,909
So I wanted to make it as easy
as I could to live with this diagnosis.

573
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,581
So what did you do to make ends meet?

574
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,459
I was borrowing money from my parents,

575
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,461
borrowing from friends. [inhales]

576
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,007
Skipping lunch,
selling everything I owned, basically.

577
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,009
[ominous music plays]

578
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,137
[Aaron] The tactics that Sabrina would use

579
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,515
were life and death of some variety.

580
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,188
Threats of self-harm.

581
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,690
I'm gonna kill myself if you don't get me

582
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,359
this giant chunk of money
that she was depending on.

583
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,490
Someone constantly calling you,

584
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,827
threatening to kill themselves
if you can't get something for them,

585
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,329
is emotional abuse.

586
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:47,001
Phone calls took up
massive portions of my day,

587
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,379
and directly led
to me losing multiple jobs.

588
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,424
'Cause I wasn't getting work done.

589
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,888
If I had to put my anxiety on a ten scale,
I was probably at an eleven.

590
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,309
I definitely had suicidal ideations.

591
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,312
I could kill myself.

592
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,315
My insurance would pay out
to Sabrina and take care of her,

593
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,859
and then I would just be done.

594
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,403
I'd kill two birds with one stone.

595
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,947
She would be taken care of

596
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,324
and I wouldn't have
to deal with it anymore.

[music fades]

598
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,456
Did you understand
that it was abuse that you had endured?

599
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,543
It took me a while
to really label it as abuse.

600
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,088
-Even though that's what it was.
-Mm. Yeah. Did you feel stuck?

601
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,465
-Oh, 100%.
-This is… No? Yeah?

602
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,678
I didn't wanna be the one
that abandoned the sick girl to die.

603
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,804
Yeah.

604
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,306
That probably went on
for about two-and-a-half years of just…

605
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,810
-Two-and-a-half years of pressure.
-I start running out of money.

606

[tense music plays]

607
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,022
At a certain point,
I knew I was being taken advantage of.

608
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,441
I knew that I was being exploited,

609
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,363
and that I was the only one
that could end it, but I also

610
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,449
wasn't strong enough to yet.

611
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,453
The damage she did
to almost every relationship I had.

612
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,997

00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:11,502
My credit. My livelihood. My will to live.

614
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,757
At that point,
I finally got to beyond last resort.

615
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
I couldn't take it.

616
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:25,433
The day I finally ended it with Sabrina,
I called one of my friends over

617
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,978
to be there to make sure
I wouldn't lose my nerve.

618

[melancholy music plays]

619
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:34,275
[Aaron] I sat her down in the living room,
and I told her, "I'm done."

620
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,321
She kind of glumly nodded,

621
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,115
and I think,
she basically just accepted that…

622
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,870
she'd gotten as much out of me
as she was gonna get.

623
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,916
And that was it. It was over.

624
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,335
[Cecilie] That was really brave of you.

625
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,755
Like, walking away is
one of the hardest things we can do.

626
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,341
Did you ever hear
from her again after this?

627
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,845
Not really, but I did get a call
from the FBI after I left her.

628

[frantic music plays]

629
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,937
[Aaron] The FBI told me they were
building a case against Sabrina.

630
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,024
It was so horrifying.

631
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,319
I knew I'd been taken advantage of,

632
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,988
but it was then that I realized
I had been scammed.

633
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,660
The breadth and the scale
of what she had managed to pull off

634
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,203
was dumbfounding.

635
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,457
Almost everything about her
was a carefully constructed

636
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,501
pile of lies.
