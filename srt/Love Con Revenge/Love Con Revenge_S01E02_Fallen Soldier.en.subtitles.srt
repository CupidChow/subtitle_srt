-[Brianne] Hey. Hey.
-Hi.

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,520
[Brianne] So, I wanna go over some photos
from last night.

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,189
-[Cecilie] Okay.
-[Brianne] He's with another woman.

5
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,650
The question is who?

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,028
We don't know
if she's a relative, a friend.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,530
-Or his next victim at this point, so…
-[Cecilie] Yeah.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,283
[Brianne] Why don't you send this to Jill
and see if she knows who she is?

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,326
So that we could potentially help her.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,831
Hi, Jill. We have some pictures

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,668
of Todd with a woman.

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,336
Have you seen her before?

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,505
-Is that an okay way?
-Yeah. Do you know her?

14
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,757
Do you know her? Yeah.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,634
[Cecilie] Oh, she's typing already.
I hope she knows.

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,928
[music ends abruptly]

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,057
-"I do."
-What'd she say? [gasps]

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,975
-Can you come in?
-[Brianne] Yeah.

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,351
-Oh, hi.
-[Jill] Hello.

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,270
-[Brianne] Hi, beautiful.
-[Cecilie] Hi, Jill.

21
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,774
[Cecilie] We would love to know if--
What you know about her.

22
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,442
Her name is Kitt.

23
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,652
[Brianne] Okay.
How'd you come to meet her?

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,781
Todd actually introduced us
at poker one night.

25
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,282
[Brianne] Okay.

26
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,328
From what I know, she's given him
a substantial amount of money.

27
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,538
[Brianne] She is involved with him then.

28
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,041
-Yes. She definitely is.
-[Brianne] Oh, goodness.

29
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,418
[Cecilie] Have you tried to warn her?

30
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,461
-Have you--
-Yes.

31
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,673
We had several conversations
about what I thought was going on,

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,469
and she believes that everything
he's doing is really to benefit others.

33
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,054
[intriguing music plays]

34
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:40,475
Cecilie, maybe if you could speak to her,
then maybe you could make a difference.

35
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,811
Yeah. I'll do my best.

36
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,399
[suspenseful music plays]

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,667
I am on my way to Kitt's house.

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,504
I've written Kitt just a short letter.

39
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,591
I have put
that I'm a victim of romance fraud,

40
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,344
and I believe that
she's the victim of the same crime.

41
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,097
If she wants to reach out,
she can do that.

42
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,143
I want to help her,

43
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:29,065
but also if we can prove
that a crime is actively taking place,

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,402
the police are just
far more likely to prioritize Jill's case.

[Cecilie] I looked inside,
and it's just totally black.

[foreboding music plays]

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,648
[Cecilie] It's a long shot.
She might be in too deep.

50
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,402
When you're in the middle of this, like,

51
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,779
you don't want to believe
that you're being scammed.

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,781
You don't trust
your own instincts anymore,

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,243
so you rely on your abuser
because that's what feels safe.

54
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:28,166
But you know deep down something is wrong.

55
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,376
You can… You can feel it.

56
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,465
In the end,
you have to deal with the truth.

57
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,383
You have to confront your nightmare.

[chimes]

61
00:03:55,818 --> 00:04:00,490
[Brianne] Hey, Cecilie. Okay, so I've been
talking to a woman called Terra,

62
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,495
who Todd approached, apparently,
about remortgaging Sanjara.

63
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,332
She has this secret recording of Todd.

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,584
Now, I don't know what's on it,

65
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,089
but hopefully she'll have some information
that would be valuable to us.

66
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,675
I need you to go and talk to her.

67
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,350
[music fades]

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
Hi. Is it Terra?

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
-Yes. Hi Cecilie.
-Yeah, hi. Cecilie. Hi.

70
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,609
-Very nice to meet you.
-Thank you for meeting up with me.

71
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:41,364
I believe that you might have, um,
some information about Todd Dean.

72
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,282
Yes.

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,909
At the time,
I was in the banking industry,

74
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,706
and he came to us
looking to refinance his property.

75
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,165
And this is Sanjara?

76
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,667
-This is Sanjara Wellness.
-Yeah.

77
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,713
-And there was just a lot of delays.
-Yeah.

78
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:03,052
He would send endless,
endless text messages and selfies.

79
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,848
I've never had another customer
ever send me a selfie.

80
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,476
And so we scheduled a time
to actually meet with him,

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,524
and I thought we were about to start
talking facts, the figures, the numbers.

82
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:21,154
And he said, "Hey, Terra,
would it matter, uh, in getting the refi

83
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,948
if, um,
somebody's filing a suit against me?"

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,370
And he just starts talking
about all these women and the…

85
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,707
the "Todd-hater group"
and all these things that he's done.

86
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm literally just sitting there
in absolute disbelief.

87
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,338
Yeah.

88
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,007
And so,
while he's getting a drink of water,

89
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,803
I just reached in to grab my phone,
and I have a recording.

90
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,100
[Terra] Oh no,
I already poured mine in here.

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,602
Yeah, I poured mine in here.

92
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,440
So let me see if I can remember names.

93
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,400
[intriguing music plays]

94
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,526
[Todd] So.

95
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,114
So I'll give you the short story.
I met a gal by the name of Karen Alpert.

96
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,452
Karen is… is just…
Karen is just mentally deranged.

97
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,373
[Todd inhales] And then Sheena,
who was working for me as my assistant,

98
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,958
wanted things to go her way,
and I said, "I'm the CEO."

99
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,795
"We've gotta do things this way."
She didn't like that.

100
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,006
And Jill and I
went on a couple dates, had sex.

101
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,176
So I'm struggling
to pay bills every month, you know.

102
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,886
If I need $25, she sent me $25.

103
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,305
She needed $100,
I'd send her $100 if I had it.

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,975
So Jill said she gave me $25,000.
She never gave me $25,000.

105
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,603
-Everything added up…
-[Terra] That's a lot of money.

106
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,521
[Todd] Hold on.

107
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,732
They're portraying me like
Todd's this douchebag who's skint.

108
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,402
It's not true. It's so far from the truth.

109
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,029
Tinder Swindler.

110
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,532
-You ever seen that show?
-[Terra] Yeah, Netflix.

111
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,451
[Todd] I watch the movie, and I go,
"God, I can relate to this shit."

112
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,871
[Terra] But if I recall correctly,
the Tinder Swindler,

113
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,666
these guys duped them
out of a lot of money.

114
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,836
[Todd] Because, well,
I'm the… I'm the opposite.

115
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,839
Okay, so I'm not the swindler.

116
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,427
I'm just a guy doing the best I can.
I've been supported by wonderful people.

117
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,095
I pay the bills every month.

118
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:14,767
Somehow, someway, I have been so blessed
with so many friends that have stepped up.

119
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,438
-[Terra] Mm-hmm.
-[Todd] I'm talking $10,000 every month.

120
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,816
-[Terra] These friends give you $10,000?
-[Todd] Every month.

121
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:27,238
There's no swindling.
There's ze-- There's been zero swindling.

122
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,535
And to hear that he said
that he's blessed, it makes me sick.

123
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,829
He admits that for years,

124
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:41,127
he's been receiving tens of thousands
of dollars a month from these "friends."

125
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,591
It felt really horrible for these women
that have been so impacted.

126
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,176
Mm. Yeah.

127
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,178
It was very eye-opening. Very eye-opening.

128
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,972
Yeah. Thank you so much
for meeting up with me,

129
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,559
and I think this will make a real impact.

130
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,061
[tense music plays]

131
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,730
[phone dialing]

132
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,899
[Cecilie] Bri, you won't believe this.

133
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,526
Todd admits getting money
from multiple women,

134
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
and he has no shame about it.

135
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,364
Do you think this will help Jill's case?

136
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,994
[Brianne] Look, I absolutely think
it's gonna help the police investigation.

137
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,579
It's time to expose Todd

138
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:21,417
and make sure he can't use Sanjara
as a tool to scam people any longer.

139
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,216
If you look at the second page,
it was a specific bank statement.

140
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,885
-You have $50,000 here.
-Do you see the large deposits?

141
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,678
-Yeah, those are important.
-Yeah, 50.

142
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,597
We have the statements from these women.

143
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,726
We can show that he's been doing this
for, you know, how many years?

144
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,231
Our job is to say,
"Look, she's not a woman scorned."

145
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:48,027
"She's not the first.
We found others. Listen to all of them."

146
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,196
[Cecilie] The checking account.

147
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,073

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,664
Do you feel that we have enough?

150
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,041
Yeah, I think we do have enough
to move forward.

151
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,043
-Wanna get out the sun?
-Yes.

152
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,127
'Cause…

153
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,966
If we do this right,
the perpetrators could face jail time,

154
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,220
and they could be required to pay
the victims back the money they're owed.

155
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,850
[music fades]

156
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,396
-[Brianne] How are you feeling, Jill?
-[Jill] I feel good.

157
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,814
[Brianne] Okay. Glad to hear that.

158
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,943
I'm excited to hear what, um,
what you all have discovered.

159
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,154
Yeah, yeah. Well, we think we're ready.

160
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,908
Let's see if we can move forward
with potentially prosecuting this guy.

161
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,870
We have statements from multiple women

162
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:45,001
who are willing to talk about, um,
the pattern of behavior that he has.

163
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,339
So we have Karen, $46,000.

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,634
Bridget, $12,000.

165
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,804
Kristi, $8,000.

166
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,808
Theresa, $2,500.

167
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,767
[Jill] Wow.

168
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,728
[Brianne] It's not just you.

169
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,688
And this is significant

170
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,025
because it's gonna show the police
that she's not alone.

171
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,901
This is a serial scammer.

172
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,531
Also, and what I think is kind of
the smoking gun a little bit with this.

173
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,452
We have tangible evidence
that clearly shows

174
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,996
the investor's deposits being deposited

175
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,458
and transactions that show
he's moving them to his personal account.

176
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,796
So do you feel ready now
to go and talk to the police?

177
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,256
I do. I'm a bit anxious,

178
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,551
but with your all's help,
I feel good about it.

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
[suspenseful music plays]

180
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,935
[Jill] The last time
that I reached out to the police,

181
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,731
they said that, no,
there was nothing they could do,

182
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,107
that it was a civil matter.

183
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,610
I was shocked. I was hurt.

184
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,570
I was humiliated.

185
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,531
I'm a little nervous because

186
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,242
I still have the feeling of,

187
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,288
"Are they gonna look at me
like the scorned woman?"

188
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,749
[Brianne] We can change that perspective.

189
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,460
Be okay with the worst-case scenario,
and then you'll be fine.

190
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,545
-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Brianne] Do you know what I mean?

191
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,880
So don't let them do that.

192
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,844
[Cecilie] What has struck me the most
is how difficult it is to get justice.

193
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,015
The police don't know enough
about the crime.

194
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,726
They don't know which laws are applicable.

195
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,148
And they don't have enough resources
to actually go and prosecute the cases.

196
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,110
So, all too often,
they just turn people away.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,154
[Brianne] Y'all ready?

198
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,575
-Where's our paperwork?
-[Cecilie] Here.

199
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,827
[Brianne] Is that everything?

200
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,082
[Cecilie] Everything depends on
if they will take you seriously.

201
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,921
[Jill] I'd like to report a fraud.

202
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,257
I'm not the only victim.

203
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,385
[Brianne] We have a ton of evidence
to support what she's saying.

204
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,388
-[officer] Let me call my sergeant.
-[Jill] Okay.

205
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,682
[officer] Figure out
what we're gonna do on our side.

206
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,143
-[Jill] Okay.
-[officer 2] Are you gonna wait inside?

207
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,063
-Or would you like to wait outside?
-[Jill] We'll wait outside in the vehicle.

208
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,940
[Brianne] So we just have to wait.

209
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,526
Could be five minutes,
could be five hours.

210
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,611
[tense music plays]

211
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,038
[Jill] My nerves are coming back
now that we're sitting here waiting.

212
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
[Cecilie] We need to be confident.

213
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,759
-[Jill] Someone's pulling up.
-[Cecilie] I saw someone.

214
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,219
-[Brianne] Yes, he's coming out. Come on.
-Okay.

215
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,388
-[Cecilie] Hi.
-[officer 3] Jill?

216
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,223
[Cecilie] I'm not Jill.
Jill is coming out,

217
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,642
so say hi to her. [chuckles]

218
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,352
We're just here to support.

219
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,606
-Are you Jill?
-[Jill] I am. Are you Officer Davis?

220
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,775
-I am. It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

221
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,029
[Davis] I was looking at
the total you had.

222
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,741
That alone is breaching
into felony territory.

223
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,702
It's gone past a civil matter
into a criminal matter.

224
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,998
There's a likelihood it could be taken
out of our hands and into federal hands.

225
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,169
What we're gonna have to do is…

226
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:19,298
[sighs] This is basically gonna go in
as a domestic fraud just on your side.

227
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,216
Right.

228
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,718
[Davis] We'll document your side.
A detective will get assigned.

229
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm gonna give you a card.

230
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,514
-That'll be your report number.
-[Jill] Okay.

231
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,768
Within a couple of days,
expect a call from a detective.

232
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,895
Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much.

233
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,357
-[Cecilie] You never give up
-[Jill] Thank you. No.

234
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,528
Thank you for supporting me
and helping and being here.

235
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,072
[Cecilie squeals] Oh God. God.

236
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,658
-[sobs]
-[Brianne] We love you, Jill.

[male newsreader] Women call him
the selfie scammer.

00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
[uplifting music plays]

240
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,342
They say he love-bombed them,
sending selfies of himself,

241
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,053
all while he was asking them for money.

242
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,139
[Jill] Seeing the news clips
of Todd going to court

243
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,600
and publicly being outed as a fraudster

244
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,895
does feel like justice
is finally being served.

245
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,738
Going public on television
has been empowering.

246
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,284
You know, it's getting easier
and easier every day,

247
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,745
I think because of the amount of women
that I feel like we have saved.

248
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,833
With the help and support
of Cecilie and Brianne,

249
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,086
it feels like we're taking him down.

250
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,137
[Cecilie] Getting justice
through the police can be a long process.

251
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
And it's not guaranteed.

252
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
Cheers to teamwork.

253
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,017
-Yeah.
-Yes.

254
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,691
[Brianne] He has gone on
for so long unchecked.

255
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,651
-Yep. Yeah.
-[Brianne] Until now.

256
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,529
You're gonna help
so many women by doing this.

257
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,906
I hope so. I hope so.

258
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,409
[Cecilie] What's been a success
in this case

259
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,496
is that Todd will no longer be able
to use Sanjara to scam people.

260
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,917
And Jill has exposed him,
stopping him in his tracks.

[music fades]

[foreboding music plays]

263
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,982
[Bridget] Hi, Cecilie.
My name is Bridget Phillips.

264
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,903
I've been dating this guy,
Ricky Morrisey, for the past two years.

265
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,201
-[Bridget] Ain't nobody afraid of you.
-[chuckles]

266
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,664
[Bridget] When I met Ricky,
I fell for him immediately.

267
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,210
He was in the military for ten years.

268
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,381
But war had scarred him,
and he had a vulnerability.

269
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,384
-Hey, Zeusie.
-[Bridget] So, like, I wanted to help him.

270
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,303
I had no idea that he was gonna try
to steal everything that I had.

271
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,807
-Bridget, let me in, please.
-[Bridget] No, what are you talking about?

272
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,183
You robbed me!

273
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,768
So I called the police.

274
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,021
But now he's run off,
and I don't know where he is.

275
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,232
I really need your help.

276
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,692
[music ends]

277
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,489
[funky music plays]

278
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,200
When I met Ricky,
I had just been divorced.

279
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,997
I had been single for two years,
and I was ready to start dating again.

280
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,125
We met on Facebook Dating.

281
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,876
I was in my early 30s,

282
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,213
and I just wanted somebody
that was genuine, loyal.

283
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,134
Like, I wanted that person
to, you know, grow old with.

284
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,762
His dating profile had
that he was in the military.

285
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,473
And the picture
with him and his dog, Zeus.

286
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,976
So, I thought
he was a really attractive guy.

287
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,438
And we had a connection
where we both loved dogs.

288
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,232
He said he wanted
a long-term relationship.

289
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,985
He wasn't looking for,
like, a quick fling.

290
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,530
He came off very normal.

291
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,616
Which, in retrospect, he wasn't.

292
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,161
[curious music plays]

293
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,581
[Bridget] We chatted for a little bit,
sending messages back and forth.

294
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,542
And then, I was at work,

295
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,045
and he was like,
"Oh, you wanna go out to dinner tonight?"

296
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,506
I was like, "You know what?
Sure, let's go out to dinner."

297
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,342
I drove an hour to go see him.

298
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,012
He was super attractive.

299
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,014
He wore, like, a nice collared shirt.

300
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,020
He took me to a Brazilian steakhouse.
I had never been to one before.

301
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,483
I was nervous,
and he made me feel comfortable.

302
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,736
He recommended, like,
what wine we drank at first.

303
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,196
He took charge.

304
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,405
It was nice.

305
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,076
It was nice to not have to make those
decisions because I'm very indecisive.

306
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,455
Right after the first restaurant,
we were walking outside, and he kissed me.

307
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,333
Like, just stopped in the parking lot.

308
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,419
But we had a lot of fun.
We went to a couple of different bars.

309
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,882
And by, like, the second bar,
third bar, we were deleting the apps.

310
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,097
I think it was, like, a mutual suggestion
'cause we were a few drinks in.

311
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,473
[laughs quietly]

312
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,309
It felt, like,
I don't need to date anymore.

313
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,269
Like, this is feeling good.

314
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,147
He was, like, the perfect man.

315
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,570
[Cecilie] Hi.

316
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,073
-Is it Bridget? Hi, Cecilie.
-Hi.

317
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,534
-Nice to meet you. Yes,
-Can I give you a hug?

318
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,537
-[Bridget] This is Ricky's dog.
-[Cecilie] Oh wow.

319
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,039
So, Ricky had him.
It was his military dog, actually.

320
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,751
-He was in the army with Zeus.
-[Cecilie] He's gorgeous.

321
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,546
I'm so grateful that you reached out.

322
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,216
So, yeah, tell me, like, what happened?

323
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,220
[Bridget] It felt like we clicked
right away. Like, it was instant.

324
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,222
He was charming.

325
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,807
-[Cecilie] Yeah.
-He was very charming.

326
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,811
I've never dated anyone
from the m-- in the military before,

327
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,605
and I felt like I trusted him.

328
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,526
He just… He gave off that vibe
of, like, you can trust me.

329
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,903
[romantic music plays]

330
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,242
[Bridget] It definitely moved fast
after the first date.

331
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,663
The very next day, he sent me a text,
like, in the morning.

332
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,333
He was saying, "I never connected
with somebody like I am right now"

333
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,211
and "I've never had
these types of feelings before and…"

334
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,382
And then on that third date,
he was, like, "I love you."

335
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:42,139
I didn't say it back,
because I didn't… I didn't want to yet.

336
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,473
But I was f-- I was feeling it.

337
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,560
[gentle music plays]

338
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,020
[Ricky] Easy.

339
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,146
She's drooling.

340
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,023
[Bridget] She's nervous.

341
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,319
He was in the army for, like,
ten years, then he had gotten out.

342
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,486
Easy.

343
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,780
[Bridget] He was a military dog handler.

344
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,575
And Zeus served overseas with him,

345
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,578
and they had gone
on multiple tours together.

346
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,122
He had PTSD.

347
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,959
He said he did have his struggles,
but he was working on them.

348
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,965
I felt really bad for him,
and I wanted to support him

349
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,968
in any way that I could
to make him feel better.

350
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,970
[dog barking]

351
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,306
[Bridget] We were dating three months
when he moved in.

352
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,642
-[dog barking]
-[Ricky] Go. Go play.

353
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,020
[Bridget] He was looking to rent,
and then he was, like, it's expensive,

354
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,941
and so he suggested
that he move in with me.

355
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,275
[dog barking]

356
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,029
It definitely felt like a--
a step forward in the relationship.

357
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,281
[laughs]

358
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,784
[Ricky] Are you videoing?

359
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,703
It was, like,
perfect couple-type relationship.

360
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,663
Like…

361
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,791
His parents had drug problems.

362
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,502
I had family that had drug issues.

363
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:58,548
And we kind of bonded over the fact that
we both kind of had broken family issues.

364
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,429
[Cecilie] Scammers will often find ways
to bond with their victims.

365
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,724
And this is usually
over difficult life experiences.

366
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,437
For a victim, it will feel like,
"Wow, they really get me."

367
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,939
But it is strategic.

368
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,111
[Bridget] I felt like he understood me,
and I understood him.

369
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,614
He was struggling to find a job

370
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,701
because of what he's been through
and his PTSD.

371
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,620
So at the time, like,
I was the one paying for everything.

372
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,873
But he would help me out around the house,

373
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,917
like taking care of the dogs,

374
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:38,422
or he'd, like, mow the lawn,
and he always cooked.

375
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,632
He would try different recipes.

376
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,803
And we'd get, like,
little separate plates for the dogs,

377
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,055
and the dogs would have
a little snack with us.

378
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,183
It was definitely what I was looking for.

379
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:55,439
He knew how to make me feel
like I was the only person in the world.

380
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,108
It felt like
we were gonna be together forever.

381
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,235
[music fades]

382
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,363
But then one day, we had a couple drinks,

383
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:08,327
and we're sharing, you know,
life stories, and he started crying.

384
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,787
-[Cecilie] Did he?
-He, like, tears…

385
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,165
And he was, like, "I wanna explain."

386
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,210
So his best friend died saving his life.

387
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,504
They were, like, clearing a building,

388
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,091
and his friend Clarence
took bullets for him

389
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,386
and ended up passing away.

390
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,347
[somber music plays]

391
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,392
[Bridget] He told me that him and Clarence
grew up together,

392
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,478
had been best friends forever.

393
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,314
He would tell me how guilty he felt.

394
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,817
It was his fault
that Clarence had passed away.

395
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,407
His tattoo on his arm,
he used it as, like, a memorial.

396
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,328
It stands for rest in peace,
Clarence Williams III.

397
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,373
I was shocked.

398
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,750
It's insane
to go through something like that.

399
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,630
So I felt like I could, like,
definitely help him in a way.

400
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,890
He said, you know,
because Clarence saved his life in war,

401
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:16,353
that he felt compelled
to give Clarence's wife and children money

402
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,189
because he doesn't have
that income anymore.

403
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,402
He emphasized that he always
does this because of his guilt

404
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,946
that Clarence died and he didn't.

405
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,199
He struggled to keep a job
since the military,

406
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:33,078
so he would ask for money
to give to Clarence's family.

407
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,704
I didn't wanna say no.

408
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:39,167
"I understand that this is, like,
a traumatic event you went through, and…

409
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,336
this is a man that saved your life."

410
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,256
I was like, "Well, let's figure it out."

411
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,716
[Cecilie] So, if you think back,

412
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,680
like, how much do you think that you,
you know, spent then on Clarence's family?

413
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,848
[Bridget] Altogether…

414
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,812
probably had to go up to,
like, 10,000-ish.

415
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,522
-It could be, like…
-Wow. Yeah.

416
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,858
Between the whole two years
we were together.

417
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,027
[Cecilie] How did the relationship end?

418
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,115
I was checking my bank statements,
and when I was going through it,

419
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,160
I saw all these ATM transactions
and money missing.

[Bridget] We had been together
about 18 months.

422
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,501
I'm paying for everything.
I was losing a lot of money.

423
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,795
I was getting into, like, a lot of debt.

424
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,549
Subconsciously, like, I was like,
something… something doesn't add up.

425
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,303
I started just questioning everything.

426
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,182
And then one day,
I was at home, I was working.

427
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,852
And I looked at my account, and I just saw

428
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,772
tons of ATM withdrawals, $500 at a time.

429
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,274
And I was like, "Oh my God."

[chimes]

431
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,864
Then I'm texting Ricky, and he's like,
"How do you think it happened?"

432
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,492
Like, "How much is gone?"

433
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:59,122
It was over $13,000
that was missing from the account,

434
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,166
and he's telling me he didn't do it.

435
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,838
But deep down, I knew it was him.
I knew he was taking the money out.

436
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,382
I didn't have any, like, solid proof.

437
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,763
I confronted him. He was at my house.
I was like, "You stole from me."

438
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,390
[Bridget] You need to leave
or turn yourself in to the police.

439
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,683
This is insane.

440
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,561
-Bridget, let me in. Please.
-[Bridget] No. No.

441

That's why you're ignoring me.
You don't fucking care.

talking about? You robbed me!

And it was freezing out,
and it was, like, raining out.

454
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:10,235
[Bridget] I never imagined
that he was capable of doing this to me.

-Yeah.

My whole world just blew up on me.

I mean, there was definitely times
where I was just ready to give up,

that he would destroy my life.

So how much are we talking, like,
about how much did he take from her?

473
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,736
In the end, she said, like, $50,000.

474
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,947
So much money
had been taken out from the ATM,

475
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,158
but she has no proof it was him.

476

to the banks about the withdrawals.

that he stole directly from her ATM.

everything Ricky said to Bridget

486
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,779

It's a very short profile. It's not a lot.

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,922
And if you go more in-depth,
there's still nothing here.

493
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,716
[curious music plays]

494
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,260
[Cecilie] But a big part
of his personality,

495
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,929
a big part of Ricky,
is his military career.

496
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,016
And it might have some information there
that I can go after

497
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,352
and see if I can do more of a deep dive.

498
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,858
It looks like there's something here.

499
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,403
I found the Facebook page of his infantry.

500
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,697
And they have pictures, actually,

501
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,161
all the way back to when Ricky
was supposed to be in the army.

502
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,456
It's a long shot,
but I'm just going through the pictures

503
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:15,378
just seeing if any of these men
resembles Ricky.

504
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,923
That is him!

505
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,634
This is great,

506
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,804
because especially
the people around him here,

507
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,183
they would have spent time with Ricky.

508
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,521
And it looks like, yeah,
we would have some names here too.

-Oh, there we go.

515
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,670
Here we are. [chuckles]

516
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,130
Hi, Brad.

517
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,925
-Hi. How are you?
-[Cecilie] Hi. I'm good.

518
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm doing an investigation into Ricky.

519
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,889
What were you doing
in the service with Ricky?

520
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,518
[Tommy] I was a combat medic
deployed to Al-Asad, Iraq.

521
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,770
[Brad] I served in the 3rd platoon.

522
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,105
Ricky was in the same platoon.

523
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,982
What was your impression of Ricky?

524
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,151
Very athletic, good-looking guy.

525
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,861
Smooth talker.

526
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,655
People gravitated to him.

527
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,657
[Cecilie] Was he a good soldier?

528
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,243
[Brad] Ricky had all the potential
to be a great soldier.

529
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:33,164
He just squandered one opportunity,
and then he squandered the second.

530
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,208
He was always a party guy, you know.

531
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,586
You said that he liked to party.
What did you mean by that?

532
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,590
Going to clubs downtown,
getting hammered in the barracks.

533
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,176
I don't wanna say
he was a womanizer, but, uh.

534
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,220
He hit on anything
that would give him attention.

535
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,055
You know, I'll put it that way.

536
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,684
He's been saying that he's had
a military career of ten-plus years.

537
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,644
Um, no, that's a lie.

538
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,981
I'm gonna be completely blunt.
That shit makes me angry.

539
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,818
[Brad] He ended up getting kicked out
for drugs after three years or so.

540
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,820
Yeah.

541
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,904
Wow.

542
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,741
That is a revelation
that is really interesting to hear.

543
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
-[Brad] Yeah.
-Okay.

544
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,830
And, like, do you remember him
having a military working dog?

545
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,915
No, I don't see why he would.

546
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,417
Uh, that's a lie.

547
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,669
That is a lie.

548
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:24,257
People that are in our infantry regiment,
you wouldn't have a military working dog.

549
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,303
I mean, I'm trying not to laugh
because that is garbage.

[curious music plays]

551
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,060
[Cecilie] And do you remember
a guy called Clarence Williams III?

552
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,604
[Tommy] Yeah.

553
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,314
He's from my hometown.

554
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,151
Did you ever see
Clarence and Ricky together, you know?

555
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,903
-[Tommy] I don't know, uh…
-Okay.

556
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,907
Maybe, possibly, um,

557
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,161
but I can't say for sure
if he knew Clarence that way.

558
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,249
Would you be able to put me in contact
with anyone in Clarence's family?

559
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
Let me see what I can do.

560
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:04,047

taking the time. Have a good day.

Hi, Abrill. My name is Brianne Joseph.

570
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,867
I'm investigating a guy who served
in the military with your brother,

571
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,995
and I would love an opportunity

572
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,373
to speak with you
about some claims that he's made.

573
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,210
[Abrill] Yes, ma'am.
I-- I'm willing to meet.

574
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,921
[curious music plays]

575
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,341
[Bridget] A lot of our relationship
revolved around Clarence.

576
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,260
He would talk about Clarence all the time.

577
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,430
Anytime it came up to be, um,

578
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:59,227
like, Memorial Day, Clarence's birthday,
he would get really emotional.

579
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,606
It was always like,
you know, "I wanna help out his family."

580
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,109
"I always gave
Clarence's wife and kids money."

581
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,863
You know, he's like, "If we wanna spend
time together, I need you to help me out."

582
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:15,493
"As, like, a team we need to do this,
and, you know, I'll pay you back."

583
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,579
I looked up everything.

584
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,748
I would google,
like, the story behind Clarence,

585
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,294
and I could tell he was a real person
and that he had died in battle.

586
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,887
[Brianne] Ricky clearly has exaggerated
a lot about his military experience,

587
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,931
but that doesn't make him a criminal.

588
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,855
We have to prove that he had an intention
to, uh, defraud her.

589
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,985
-[Brianne] Hi.
-Hi.

590
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,487
I'm Brianne Joseph.
We spoke over the phone.

591
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,989
Oh yes. How are you?

592
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,615
-[Brianne] I'm good.
-My name's Abrill.

This is the keepsake trunk
that we received from Afghanistan.

This is the uniform
that he had left behind.

595
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,799
And this is the day we brought him

596
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,345
to Tampa Air Force Base.

597
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,472
[melancholy music plays]

598
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,849
[Talisa] That's all of us
standing out waiting

599
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,143
to welcome him back.

600
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,112
[Brianne] So, how long did he serve?

601
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,032
[Talisa] He was only in for two years.

602
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,410
That was his first tour to go overseas.

603
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,329
-To Afghanistan.
-[Brianne] Okay.

604
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,040
Was he in contact with you guys often?

605
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:48,419
He and I talked a lot, um,
sometimes two and three times a day.

606
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,089
He told me from day one
he was getting shot at

607
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,965
and bombed at from day one.

608
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,095
[Bridget] Ricky explained to me that

609
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,971
they were going in
and clearing a building.

610
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,559
And that he went right,
but he should have went left.

611
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,646
And he made the mistake and the…

612
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,732
like, the terrorists came
and were shooting at them

613
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,985
and that Clarence stepped in front of him
and saved his life.

614
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,489
He took several bullets for him.

615
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,785
And then he died right in front of Ricky.

616
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,373
So, you know, when he lost Clarence,
it was devastating for him.

617
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,460
[Brianne] So, if you don't mind me asking,

618
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,713
what were the circumstances
of him passing away?

619
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,175
[Abrill] It was him
and five other soldiers.

620
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,428
-[Talisa] Got killed, one that survived.
-[Abrill] One survived.

621
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,682
In the vehicle that they were in.

622
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,684
And, um…

623
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,228
[gentle music plays]

624
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,400
Clarence's vehicle
was the one that did get hit.

625
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,652
[Brianne] Mmm. I'm so sorry to hear that.

626
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,532
The reason that I'm here

627
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,702
is because I'm trying
to get a little insight

628
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:08,082
on one of Clarence's really close friends,
Ricky Morrisey.

629
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,502
He claimed
that Clarence took a bullet for him.

630
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:17,300
-No, ma'am. That's not… That's incorrect.
-[Abrill] No. Clarence passed by…

631
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:21,470
Passed away due to an IED,
improvised explosive device.

632
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,348
[tense music plays]

633
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,310
He also claimed

634
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,189
that he was
sending money to Clarence's family.

635
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,356
-No.
-[Talisa] No.

636
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,195
If I'm not mistaken,
it was to Clarence's kids?

637
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,739
-Clarence doesn't have any kids.
-No kids at all.

638
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,952
Do you know Ricky?

639
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,665
You know, we… we've pretty much met
all of Clarence's friends.

640
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,252
The soldiers would call me Mama Williams.

641
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,172
-That's the type of relationship we have.
-[Brianne] Wow.

642
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,842
And, um, I've never heard of a Ricky.

643
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,595
[music fades]

644
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,683
Anytime, like, we had
a disagreement or argument,

645
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,269
it was, "I swear on Clarence's life."

646
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,733
Ricky was always crying
and he was breaking down in front of me.

647
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,443
It was awkward.

648
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,781
But it felt genuine.

649
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,367
It felt like he was sharing,
like, a part of him.

650
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:29,038
His tattoo on his arm takes up, like,
the whole bottom part of his forearm.

651
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,292
It was just so crazy for me to think
that somebody could lie about

652
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,087
a tattoo on your arm
of somebody's name that you don't know.

653
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,844
[Talisa] Clarence's name
does not deserve this.

654
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,266
I feel if he gets away with it,
he's gonna continue to do it.

655
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,017
[melancholy music plays]

656
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,191
[Brianne] I hope you guys
enjoy the rest of your day as well.

657
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,110
-[Abrill] You too.

Clarence's family has never heard of him.

665
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,179
It's all a scam.

666
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:32,059
It was all intentional
to deceive Bridget to get her money.

I have to say, it's evil.
He knows so well what he's doing too.

[Cecilie] There are so many levels
to Ricky's deceit.

00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,126
His military career,

674
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,129

the lengths that fraudsters will go.

677
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,724
And for them, nothing is off limits.

678
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,522
[Bridget] Any time
I would question something,

679
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,358
he'd either get angry and be like,

680
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,778
"How dare you ask me
these types of questions?"

681
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,656
Or he would turn it around
so that I was, like, the bad person.

682
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,038
One time, I had, like, a $10 random charge
on my debit card.

683
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,083
I think I had texted him during the day,
like, "Hey, did you do this?"

684
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,462
And he was like, "No, I didn't do it."

685
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,965
And then I got home from work,

686
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,134
and, like, on the kitchen table
was a suicide note.

[suspenseful music plays]

688
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,473
He had, like, set up this whole thing
in the basement.

00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,184
And he had a gun to his head.

690
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,479
He made sure I knew it was loaded.

691
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,400
And he was crying,
and he was, like, upset.

692
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,112
And I was just trying to,
like, get that gun out of his hand.

693
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,864
I was terrified.
I didn't know what he was gonna do.

694
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,327
And he finally put it down.

695
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,332
But he had been to war
and I didn't want to traumatize him more.

696
