[Episode 24]

3
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,920
I already have gray hair.

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,239
I'm really getting old.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,880
Your Highness, you've been worrying over
state affairs day and night.

6
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,039
This is merely
a momentary sign of fatigue.

7
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,280
In my eyes,

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Your Highness is as graceful as ever,

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
without a trace of aging.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,560
Shaman, you really do know

11
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,760
how to sweet-talk me.

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,800
Those are my true feelings—

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,130
no flattery in it at all.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,360
Once the wedding is complete tomorrow

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520
and the position of Queen of Mocheng
changes hands,

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,920
Your Highness can truly rule the realm

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,320
in peace.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,850
Unfortunately,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,020
the Tiger Tally remains unfound.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
No matter how perfect the plan,

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,560
without military authority to back it,

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,970
it's nothing more than
a castle in the air.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,800
I've sent people to infiltrate
the Bai Residence,

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
but there's no sign of the Tiger Tally

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
found on Feng Li.

26
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,170
It seems I'll have to

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,680
take matters into my own hands.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
So Bai Yu has taken good care of you, Li.

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,240
After only a few days here,

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
even your complexion has improved.

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
How much longer do you plan

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,460
to keep up this act?

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
Li,

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm running out of patience.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,900
Hand over the Tiger Tally.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,280
It'll benefit us both.

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,460
What are you doing?

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
Li's already in this state!

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Why are you still forcing her?

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,380
All of you, get out!

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
I can't bring myself to lay a hand on her,

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,079
but that doesn't mean I would spare you.

43
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,760
Do it!

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
Li,

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,980
hand over the Tiger Tally.

46
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,960
Otherwise,

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,079
his other hand

48
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,410
won't be spared either.

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Li,

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,200
don't listen to her!

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,120
Ignore her!

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,960
I didn't expect you to be this cold, Li.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,160
Lu Ran.

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,280
Do it again.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,240
Do you intend to

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
keep silent

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
until he's dead?

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Your Highness,

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
the Xiqi delegation
has entered the imperial city

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,540
and is waiting at the palace gate
to be summoned.

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,600
At such a critical time?

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,460
Your Highness,

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
since we've got her in our custody,

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
getting the Tiger Tally is only
a matter of time.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,640
Let it be for now.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,240
The wedding tomorrow

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
is what matters most.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,280
Li,

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,480
be wise.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
I'll be back.

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I hope that by then,

72
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,079
you'll have thought it through.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Li,

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,650
don't be afraid.

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,380
As long as you stay with me,

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
everything will pass.

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,800
Please rest here for the moment,
Your Excellency.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Everyone else has also been
properly accommodated.

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
To ensure the safety
of the Xiqi delegation,

80
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,570
the palace will assign guards
to escort you at all times.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,600
Escort?

82
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,690
This is clearly surveillance.

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
Who's there?

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,120
Hold on.

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,440
Hold on.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
It's me,

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,440
Feng Ling'er.

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Feng Ling'er?

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Princess Ling of Mocheng?

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
Why are you here?

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,700
This is your sister Xin Miao's token.

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,840
She asked me to come find you

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,100
to coordinate tomorrow's wedding plan.

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,080
She can't get out right now.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,020
We can only rely on ourselves.

96
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
How is Xin Miao doing?

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
Do you know what the plan is?

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
Rest assured.

99
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,490
She's staying safely at my residence.

100
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
As for the plan,

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,300
I don't have time to explain it
to you now.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Once you leave here,

103
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
go meet Xin Miao.

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,010
She'll go over everything
with you in detail.

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
What's this about?

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,600
What do you think?

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,330
Changing clothes, obviously.

108
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,320
You put on my dress,

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
and I'll stay here in your place.

110
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
How else are you supposed to get out?

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
You're a grown man.

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
Why are you being so fussy?

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
Are all Xiqi men like this?

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
You rude woman.

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,520
You...

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Turn around already.

117
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,760
This outfit actually

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
suits you quite well.

119
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,200
Look at

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,180
our reflection in the mirror.

121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,280
Don't we look just like

122
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,140
an ordinary mother and daughter?

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
My obedient daughter,

124
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
so well-behaved,

125
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,810
never making a fuss,

126
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
letting me dress her up

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,409
and sending her off to get married.

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
What a pity—

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
you're not her after all.

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,160
No blood ties, no memories,

131
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,850
just an identical face.

132
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
Perhaps it's for the best
that you aren't her.

133
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
Tomorrow,

134
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
you'll don Feng Li's wedding dress,

135
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
take her place at the wedding,

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
and then

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,080
die in her stead.

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,930
Why did you put yourself through this?

139
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,640
You are Feng Li?

140
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,679
So...

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,840
So it was all a lie.

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
You never

143
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,880
belonged to me.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
Bai!

145
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,810
You're afraid of dying,

146
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,740
aren't you?

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,530
Then help me finish this final act,

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
and everything will be yours.

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm afraid there are ominous signs.

153
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
This marriage is ill-fated.

154
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,450
The heavens are warning us!

155
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,890
When mortals deceive their ruler,

156
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,330
Heaven and Earth will not tolerate it!

157
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
Calamity has befallen us

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,600
all because someone
is impersonating another

159
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,920
at this wedding!

160
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,050
The Young Master of Xiqi is,

161
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,340
in truth, a woman in disguise.

162
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
This is Xiqi deceiving our Mocheng!

163
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,040
What? It's fake?

164
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,920
How could that be?

165
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,250
Stop talking nonsense!

166
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,480
Xiqi sincerely wishes

167
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,240
to ally with Mocheng.

168
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,480
How could we possibly hide or deceive?

169
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
If it's true,

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
why not take off that mask in public?

171
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
That's right.

172
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,280
Exactly.

173
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,360
Young Master!

174
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,240
The Mocheng troops

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
have surrounded the black jade

176
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,240
we brought from Xiqi,

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
claiming they were ordered to guard it

178
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,210
and that no one is to touch it
without permission!

179
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Li and I are deeply in love
and of one mind.

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
She would never act this way.

181
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
It was my order.

Greetings, Your Highness.

184
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,620
What's your intention in this,
Princess Royal?

185
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
If you truly wish to wed,

186
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,410
then take off your mask.

187
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
If you've got nothing to hide,

188
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,970
why fear showing your face?

189
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Mocheng has mobilized troops to besiege
our delegation without telling us.

190
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
Is this how you treat

191
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,660
your guests from Xiqi?

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,280
You clearly committed wrongdoing first,

193
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
and now you try to deny it?

194
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,810
This Queen in front of us

195
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,080
is an impostor.

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,760
Since she returned from Xiqi,

197
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,120
she has remained silent and acted timidly,

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,450
failing to display the dignity of a ruler.

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,680
Clearly, it was a scheme by Xiqi

200
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
to replace our Queen of Mocheng

201
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,840
with an impostor.

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,880
A mute woman has been impersonating
our Queen,

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
using the pretense of marriage alliance

204
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
to scheme against
the foundations of our state.

205
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,680
Both the Queen herself

206
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,240
and her carefully plotted actions

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,560
reveal her treacherous intentions!

208
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,000
That's right.

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,060
But she looks exactly like the Queen.

210
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,560
This...

211
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,720
Enough!

212
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,280
Meng Wu.

213
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
That thing you want

214
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
is in my hands.

215
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,400
This grand play

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,560
has finally reached its climax.

217
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
You've plotted for years

218
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
for this final battle.

219
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
I'll grant your wish.

220
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
I played along with your scheme

221
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
just to see

222
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,640
how low you could actually sink.

223
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,480
Stay calm.

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,930
We still have a chance for revenge.

225
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Dongli's loyalists still obey my commands.

226
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,880
They'll create chaos when the time comes,

227
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,640
and I'll have them escort you
out of the palace first.

228
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,240
As long as we're still alive,

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
the game is not over.

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Your Highness.

231
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
Now that we've learned the truth,

232
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,000
we swear to follow you to the death,

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
Your Highness!

234
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
How dare you betray me!

235
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,290
It was you who betrayed Dongli.

236
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
You conspired with Meng Wu,

237
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
murdered my parents,
and seized my kingdom.

238
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,960
Today,

239
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,160
I'll make you pay for it in blood!

240
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
Here.

241
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,160
Guards.

242
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Strip Meng Wu of her title
as Princess Royal

243
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,760
and imprison her in
the Imperial Ancestral Temple

244
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,560
to reflect on her sins.
She shall never leave without permission.

245
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
This play

246
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,620
has finally come to an end.

247
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,840
I once believed

248
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,280
that fighting against heaven,

249
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,210
against people,

250
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,680
and against the injustice

251
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,440
imposed upon women in this world

252
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
was victory.

253
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
But when I ascended to the throne

254
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
and held power over life and death,

255
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
I finally realized

256
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,400
that power knows no gender—

257
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
only right and wrong.

258
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
What I've wanted to see

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
is not a world turned upside down,

260
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,760
but one where everyone can

261
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
live with dignity

262
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,520
and be true to themselves.
