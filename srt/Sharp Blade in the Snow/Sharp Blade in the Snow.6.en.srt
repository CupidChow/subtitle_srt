00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:50,960
[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,010
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,570
What's this for?

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,080
It's the rule on Flower Street.

5
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,140
Once you enter Flower Street,
you have to wear a flower.

6
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,970
You seem pretty familiar with
the rules around here.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,289
I heard about them back at Slave House.

8
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,840
The courtesans here

9
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
are said to possess
all kinds of rare treasures—

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,289
there might even be black jade.

11
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Stop right there.

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,440
Flower Street only serves
regular customers.

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,960
You two look

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,360
unfamiliar.

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
Our Flower Street

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,720
doesn't belong in the open.

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,440
Do you think

18
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
you can just walk in here?

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Who are you really?

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,280
Let me see—

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,020
which heartless man is it,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,520
bringing a pretty young lady here

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,440
to collect a debt?

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,160
What's this?

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,260
The rule on Flower Street:

26
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,890
for anyone who barges in,

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
there's only one chance—

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
Tea of Oblivion.

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,840
This tea induces hallucinations.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
It will trap you in an illusion

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,079
drawn from your most painful memories,

32
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,200
leaving you unable to escape.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,280
Very few

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,540
survive the illusion.

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,400
I must get back

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,440
what I want.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,280
No one comes unprompted.

38
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,880
Surely you didn't come this time

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,160
with no purpose in mind, either,

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,180
right, Stone King of Hell?

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,240
This pendant is the only keepsake

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
my mother left me.

43
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,360
Mother said it would keep me safe.

44
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,680
Now I'm passing that protection to you.

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,480
We must both survive.

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,970
It's my fault for not protecting you well.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,130
I should have taken you with me.

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,440
Where are you going?

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,200
Brother Stone, look!

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
I knew you wanted to kill me.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,840
Yun Zhan.

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,400
Everyone you care about will die,

53
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
and she's no exception.

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
That won't happen.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,250
You were the one who abandoned her.

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,240
She froze to death long ago—

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
torn apart by the wolves and wild dogs

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
in the mountains…

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,120
Li.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,680
Mother?

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,160
Mother.

62
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,080
I didn't kill my father.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
How could I have given birth to

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
such a wicked child like you?

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,080
You deserve to die.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,400
Mother...

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Die!

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,520
Die.

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,440
Die!

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Go to hell!

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
Die!

72
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,240
You deserve to die!

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Just die!

74
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Die!

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Wake up.

76
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,440
Alright, that's enough.

77
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
How could I bear to let you two

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,320
die here on my Flower Street?

79
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Does it hurt?

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,320
I

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
pity delicate young ladies

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,920
like you the most.

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,370
Dragging a body that's barely half alive,

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,160
you still forced your way into
my Flower Street of the underworld.

85
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
What is it that you seek?

86
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
Is it

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
life extension?

88
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,610
It's black jade.

89
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Black jade?

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720
Well, black jade is

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,320
a rare and precious thing.

92
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,880
What could you possibly offer

93
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,200
in exchange?

94
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,280
My remaining half‑life.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
If you've got the nerve
to soak for one night

96
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,880
in my Crimson Cold Pool—

97
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,000
a place of extreme yin energy
and bitter cold—

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
and still walk out alive,

99
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,680
the black jade in this box

100
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,480
will be yours.

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,960
It's a deal.

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,960
In your current condition,

103
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,680
you're hardly fit for such bravado.

104
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Are you truly not afraid of dying here?

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
I am,

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,280
but I want to truly live even more—

107
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
even if it's only for one day.

108
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Where's Yun Zhan?

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
If I make it out alive,

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
he must leave with me.

111
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Yun Zhan?

112
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Well, I'll have to give that
some serious thought.

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,480
You know the rules

114
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
of our Flower Street.

115
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,970
One thing in exchange for another.

116
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,500
If you want something,

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,040
you must offer something in exchange.

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,320
Just name it.

119
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Seems you really care about

120
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
that young lady.

121
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Tell me,

122
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,920
what do you seek by coming here this time?

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,220
To cure her poison.

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,410
I can't let her die here.

125
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,600
Just name

126
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
your price.

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,660
And you'd be willing to pay it,

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,880
no matter what, Stone King of Hell?

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Of course.

130
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
You...

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Naturally, a new love

132
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,000
comes at the price of the old.

133
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,280
The water in this pool
is bitterly cold indeed.

134
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,320
The water

135
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
seeps into every inch of my skin,

136
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
sharp as countless needles.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
Why are you here?

138
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,480
You are my life.

139
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,530
Revenge is my only purpose for living.

140
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Before I discover the truth,

141
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,170
Your Majesty Queen of Mocheng,

142
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,680
you must survive.

143
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,200
You must survive.

144
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
We must both survive.

145
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
We'll both survive.

146
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Even if I must climb mountains of blades

147
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
or descend into seas of fire,
I will pursue you—

148
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
until I personally put an end to you,

149
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,920
the last remnant of Mocheng.

150
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,450
Aren't you afraid of death?

151
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,500
Are you afraid, Your Majesty?

152
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
Like a phoenix reborn from the ashes,

153
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,490
to face death is to be born anew.

154
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
What do I have to fear?

155
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,480
Your Majesty,

156
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,360
but your condition...

157
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,400
I know what condition

158
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
my body is in.

159
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,290
The drink you take daily...

160
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,060
That so‑called calming potion
is my death warrant.

161
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
I knew it.

162
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I don't care.

163
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,490
So you've been aware

164
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,960
of everything all along, Your Majesty.

165
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
Yet I still

166
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,160
can't see through you.

167
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,250
Then, Your Majesty,

168
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,540
how would you like to see me more clearly?

169
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,930
What exactly are you after?

170
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
Burning bridges now

171
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
isn't a good idea.

172
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,720
I wonder if Li's journey

173
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,780
has been going well

174
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,250
and when she'll return.

175
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,810
What should I do?

176
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,570
What should I do now?

177
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,840
Li,

178
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
I recently acquired

179
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,280
some blood swiftlet nest

180
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,210
and made it into sweet soup for you.

181
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
Heavy guards outside,

182
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,680
yet silence within—

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,660
could this be some sort of
empty-fort trick?

184
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
Your Majesty, why do you

185
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
only favor Yun Zhan so much?

186
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,770
It truly breaks our hearts!

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
So they're having a jealous quarrel.

188
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,960
Your Highness,

189
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,840
shall we come back another day?

190
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,800
You and I have been childhood sweethearts,

191
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,880
and I dare say
my feelings for you are sincere.

192
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
