00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,980
[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,020
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,600
General Lu, I thought

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
you had faked have death
on the road to Xiqi

5
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
and dared not return.

6
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,040
Ten years ago,

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,840
I gave my word

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,100
to help Your Highness fulfill yuor wish.

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,400
Your Highness' great cause is unfinished.

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,330
How could I abandon Your Highness?

11
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,210
I have heard

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,000
that Feng Li not only made the journey

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,039
to Xiqi safely,

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,160
but will soon return

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,420
to the city with the young master of Xiqi.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,000
If Feng Li brings helpers back with her,

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
how would I still have any good days?

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,720
So this is how you help me?

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
That girl is extremely cunning.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,680
This time,

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,289
I will make sure she never returns.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,840
Feng Li still cannot die.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,160
What?

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Have you grown reluctant again?

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,200
Feng Ling'er said

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,120
the Tiger Tally was taken away by Feng Li.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Without the Tiger Tally,

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,170
how can the Phoenix Seal be opened?

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
And how could I

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
ever become the Lord of Mocheng?

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Then what will you do?

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,039
Feng Li

33
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,040
must be planning to use
the affair of Xiqi to strike back

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,720
and wipe us all out.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,970
She must be forced to return to Mocheng

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,970
yet must not be allowed
to return to the court.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,760
You must

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,770
think of a solution carefully.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
I have already thought
of a foolproof plan.

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,650
When the time comes,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,200
the Phoenix Seal goes to you,

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,860
and the Tiger Tally goes to me.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,720
Mocheng and Dongli
will no longer stand divided.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
The two of us

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,880
will enjoy together

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,079
the days of peace and ease.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,680
General Lu, what you consider

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,410
has always been this thorough.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
With you,

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm truly very lucky.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,560
-Father, Mother.
-Mother.

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,200
Yao, Miao.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,680
Mother.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,800
We have come today to bid our farewell.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,960
The Queen of Mocheng has agreed
that 3 days from now,

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,560
she will go to Mocheng
with my sister to be married.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,079
And under the name
of escorting Xiqi's wedding tribute,

58
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,040
the Mo Stone,

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,160
elite soldiers will be taken to Mocheng.

60
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,880
On this journey,

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,720
first, it is to help the Queen
set her household in order,

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,520
and even more so
to ensure our city's peace and harmony.

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Mother.

64
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
On this trip to Mocheng,

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,320
Yao and I

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,600
will seize the opportunity
to switch back our identities.

67
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,680
When that time comes,

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
everything will return

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,970
to its original course.

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,640
Your father suffered a stroke to this day,

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
his health has not improved.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
These past years,

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
the situation in Xiqi

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,960
has truly been hard on you two children.

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,970
You have accompanied me
and endured it together.

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Miao.

77
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,000
If for a lifetime

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,480
you are unable to openly and rightfully

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,520
be a woman,

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
if your identity cannot be made public,

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
would you feel wronged?

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
I do not feel wronged.

83
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,240
Everything I have done
has been done willingly.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,920
Xiqi has always established
the eldest son as heir.

85
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
My brother and I share the same mother.

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
My brother is physically weak,

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,040
yet he has strategy and ability.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
If what Feng Li says is true,

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,360
that this Phoenix Incense

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,090
can cure my brother's illness,

91
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,250
though this journey carries risk,

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,040
it is worth trying.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
The women of Mocheng can wear armor,

94
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
yet the princess of Xiqi

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,920
can only live and die

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
under a man's identity.

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,220
Mother, rest assured.

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
If this attempt succeeds,

99
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,360
I will switch identities with Miao,

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,200
and rightfully inherit the throne.

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
In Xiqi, men and women
will be treated equally.

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,640
Miao may be a woman by birth,

103
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,840
but she is brave and formidable in battle

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,320
and has won countless military merits.

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,560
I will see to it

106
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,840
that her identity and honor
are restored openly and rightfully.

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
The two of you

108
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
must stay safe.

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,560
Father.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,620
Father and Mother, rest assured.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,120
No one knows
the appearances of the two of us.

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
And in daily life,
you use ventriloquism with a male voice.

113
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
If danger arises,

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,840
remove the mask
and return to a female voice,

115
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,680
and you will simply be
an innocent girl
with no knowledge of anything.

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,720
You must never risk your life.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Staying alive is what matters most.

118
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Understood.

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
During the last assassination attempt,

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,260
so many brothers died.

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Yet we never even caught a glimpse

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,860
of that Demon Lord of Mocheng.

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Who knows how things
will turn out this time?

124
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,400
I hope we won't be toyed with
by that Demon Lord again.

125
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Indeed.

126
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,920
General.

127
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,409
Are you all frightened?

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,720
That Demon Lord is truly cunning.

129
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,000
But this time, we are fully prepared.

130
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,290
There will be absolutely no mistakes.

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,800
Come in.

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,520
Stop.

133
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,680
What is it?

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,370
Let us rest for a moment.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,520
Get down.

136
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,970
Sitting in this carriage
has made my back ache terribly.

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,400
Take a short rest.

138
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
We will soon reach
the imperial city of Mocheng.

139
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,380
Have some water first.

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
It is empty.

141
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,560
Pass through that forest,

142
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,640
I remember there is a lake there.

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,100
Let us go fetch some water.

144
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Young Master.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
Please give me and the Queen
a little more time alone.

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
After all, once we return to Mocheng,

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,730
it will not be easy for us to meet again.

148
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,810
Let's go.

149
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Careful.

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Are you all right?

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,080
With you here,
what is there for me to fear?

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,810
You trust me so completely now?

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Is that not exactly what you wished for?

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,340
Your Highness.

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,080
Your performance

157
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,760
of unwavering loyalty unto death

158
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,090
has indeed earned the Demon Lord's trust.

159
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,000
This time we did not lose a single soldier

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,330
and captured her alive.

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
It is all thanks to Your Highness.

162
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,040
General Lu, you sent messages
by carrier pigeon

163
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
and personally laid the ambush.

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,280
Your contribution is also indispensable.

165
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,980
If I may be so bold as to ask,

166
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
how should Feng Li be dealt with?

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
As long as Your Highness

168
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,400
and Lord Lu give the word,

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
we can end her life

170
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
on the spot

171
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,200
and remove all future trouble.

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,050
Kill her!

173
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,640
Kill her!

174
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,030
Kill her!

175
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,640
Kill her!

176
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,320
After all, she is

177
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
an important bargaining chip in our hands.

178
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,400
There are many in Mocheng

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
who want her dead.

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,240
She has an even greater use.

181
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,570
Lord Lu, it seems

182
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,740
you've long had a plan in mind.

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
I have endured years in Mocheng.

184
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
As Mocheng's shaman,

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,320
I know its affairs inside and out.

186
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,240
With just this bowl
of soul-bewitching draught,

187
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
we can trade
a mountain pheasant for a phoenix,

188
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
and no one will ever know.

189
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
The real Feng Li and the fake

190
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,920
look exactly the same.

191
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,250
They are indeed impossible to tell apart.

192
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,400
The fake Queen

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,520
can then openly and legitimately

194
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
return to Mocheng

195
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
and take control of the Phoenix Seal.

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,380
With the puppet Queen in Mocheng,

197
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Mocheng itself

198
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
can be stirred into complete chaos.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Mocheng

200
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
will be within our grasp.

201
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Our great vendetta will soon be avenged.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,520
We must make Mocheng,
that betrayer of trust and righteousness,

203
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,400
pay the price.

204
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,480
Yes.

205
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,980
This matter

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,200
cannot be delayed.

207
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
The longer we drag it out,

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
the more likely Xiqi will grow suspicious.

209
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,980
As for this matter,

210
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,370
I ask that Your Highness
take action personally.

211
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
You really do look

212
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,970
exactly like me.

213
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,640
Who are you?

214
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
You are actually mute.

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,420
They want to use you to replace me?

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Do you like it?

217
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,770
How about this outfit I'm wearing?

218
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
Come here.

219
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,820
I want to say something to you.

220
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,090
Don't be afraid.

221
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Come closer.

222
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Stop struggling.

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
You'll suffer less if you cooperate.

224
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,560
Open your mouth.
