Stone King of Hell, congratulations

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
for gaining the Demon Lord's trust.

5
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,770
If it weren't for
Jiang Zimo's interference,

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
I'd have already
killed that Demon Lord by now.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
Stone King of Hell, don't forget,

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,920
your mission

9
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,480
is to gain her trust.

10

Obtain what Princess Royal wants,

11
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,400
and only then will her life
be at your disposal.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Trust?

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,600
You're connecting me with Princess Royal.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Aren't you afraid

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,640
that Demon Lord
will take my life directly?

within a hundred paces.

19
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,880
I'm only afraid

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,240
that with just a little too much force,

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,520
you might snap the Queen's neck.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,620
I'll give you ten days.

23

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,600

Princess Royal forbids you
from entering the temple to pay respects.

63
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,130
It's truly outrageous.

64
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,960

65
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,370
not to allow me to set foot
in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
She naturally went along with it.

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,240
Princess Royal is deeply calculating.

68
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,440
She could have quietly

ended your life in the wasteland.

Yet now she welcomes you
to succeed the throne.

It's truly suspicious.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
She hasn't obtained the formula

Your guess was indeed correct.

eliminate all the assassins,

why go to such lengths?

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,760

100

to take such risks for me.

I'll definitely uncover
the true culprit who killed Father

132

and protect Mocheng's century-old legacy.

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,200
You will surely bless me, right?

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
apply my makeup.

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,280
Help me see

137
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,780
if it looks like

139
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,680
In my heart,

140
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,770
you're the most beautiful.

141
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
We are twin sisters,

142
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
so we should look exactly alike.

143
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
Born of the same mother,

144
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,840
just because she was
the legitimate daughter,

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,200
she could inherit the royal surname,

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
while I

147
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,800
could only follow Father's surname, Meng.

148
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
However,

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,450
once I get the Phoenix Incense's formula,

150
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
which controls people's minds,

151
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
and the Phoenix Seal from your

152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,170
precious daughter,

153
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
I'll send her to reunite with you
in the afterlife.

154
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,680
But

155
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,480
then,

156
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
wouldn't I be too lonely?

157
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
I will always stay by your side.

158
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,720
How could you be lonely?

159
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
It's all that damned girl's fault.

160
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
But she has been drinking

161
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,480
the medicine brewed from datura recently.

162
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
Before long,

163
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,840
she will become dizzy, vomit blood,

164
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,100
and die from weakness.

165
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
It seems

166
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880

I will serve you tonight.

169
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,760
Come.

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,440
The manager of the Slave House

171
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,800
asked me to deliver this to you.

172
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,720
Do you know why this soil is red?

173
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know.

This red soil

175
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,050

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,280
Come catch me.

191
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
Your Majesty.

192
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,520
Your Majesty.

193
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,900
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty...

194
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,560
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

195
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,480
What's happening?

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,940
Quickly, go see what to do.

197
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,320
What happened to Her Majesty?

198
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Go check quickly.

199
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,880
What's wrong?

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
What...

201
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
What should we do?

202
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Will Her Majesty be alright?

203
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,480
She should be fine.
