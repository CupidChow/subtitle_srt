[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,060
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,560
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,450
why are you barefoot again?

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,760
It's you.

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,289
Who did you think it was?

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,620
You won't feel any remorse

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
for executing Yun Zhan,

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,080
the assassin

10
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,650
who's been lurking by
your side all this time?

11
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,080
Don't talk nonsense.

12
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm only unsettled

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,520
about the decision

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,850
I have to make tomorrow.

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,080
The Spirit Lord committed a grave offense,

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,610
and Xiqi is closing in on us.

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
She is also

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,560
of your own blood,

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,840
and she still holds

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,759
the Tiger Tally of the Imperial Guard
left behind by her late mother.

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,420
No matter how this is handled,

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,500
it puts us in an impossible position.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Bai,

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,460
you don't need to bring

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,160
the mung bean cakes anymore.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Your Majesty,
have you grown tired of them?

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,079
Then I'll change the ingredients tomorrow.

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,720
How about yam?

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,320
Bai,

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,760
the road ahead is dangerous.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
You have a bright future.

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,780
I don't want to
pull you any deeper into this.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Your Majesty,

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,260
I'm not afraid.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,600
As long as you're willing,

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,400
I beg you to decree our marriage.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,079
I'm not doing this for myself alone.

38
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,140
The entire Bai clan

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
will stand behind you,

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,960
ready to

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
live and die with you.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,120
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Watch out!

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,810
Get away!

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,810
Don't touch me with your filthy hands.

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,320
Just got kicked out by the Queen,

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,050
now you're throwing a tantrum?

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
You dare eavesdrop out here?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
I serve the Queen.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,760
I belong in her hall.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,579
Isn't that exactly where I should be?

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,480
Filth like you doesn't deserve to be here.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Filth?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
The Queen happens to

55
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,720
like filth like us.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
If you were humble enough to ask,

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,600
I might even share a few tricks.

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,760
At least

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,520
then you'd still have a place

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
serving in the Queen's chambers,
wouldn't you?

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
You!

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,660
Since when did a low slave like you

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
get to humiliate me?

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
The bond between Li and me

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
is none of your business!

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,519
Please stop, Mr. Bai!

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,899
I really

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,200
didn't see anything.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,930
I didn't hear anything either.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
No.

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
You saw it.

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
Those eyes of yours

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,080
are far too sharp.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,440
The auspicious time has arrived.

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
If the noble lady from Mocheng
meant for this marriage alliance

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,690
still hasn't appeared,

77
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
then we'll be taking our leave.

78
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,000
And we'll report to
the Young Master of Xiqi

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
that Mocheng

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,560
looks down on our land.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
What should we do now?

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,770
Prime Minister Bai.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Wait a little longer.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
Go check the Fengling Palace

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,100
and the Fengxi Palace.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,560
Yes.

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
So this is how Mocheng treats its guests.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,010
Such humiliation and neglect.

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Let's go.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,720
Stop!

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,520
I will go to Xiqi myself

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,560
and marry the young lord.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,520
What?

95
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,760
Can this work?

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,720
Xiqi insists on a marriage alliance.

97
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
The bride

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,370
must be an eligible woman
of the Feng clan.

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
There's no rule

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
that says the Queen can't be one.

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Ridiculous!

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,280
What?

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Do you think the Young Master

104
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,360
is beneath me?

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,840
You already keep 3,000 slaves.

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,440
How could you possibly join Xiqi

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
and become a lady of our court?

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
You're mistaken.

109
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
This is indeed a marriage alliance,

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,440
but

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,080
but it will be forged on Mocheng's terms.

112
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,440
I've heard the Young Master of Xiqi

113
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,760
kills without mercy,

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,960
leaving rivers of blood wherever he goes.

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,200
That sounds like a perfect match for me.

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Those are nothing more than
rumors from the Central Plains.

117
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,900
Whether they're true or not
doesn't concern me.

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,520
Today,

119
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,740
I will personally
see this alliance fulfilled.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
This...

121
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,810
How can this be acceptable?

122
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,640
Your Majesty,

123
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,040
Xiqi is a barbarous land.

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,800
How can you possibly take such a risk?

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,730
The Phoenix Seal

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,240
will remain with
Prime Minister Bai for now.

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,570
If I have not returned
within half a month,

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
Prime Minister Bai may use this seal

129
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
to convene the court

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,090
and choose a new sovereign.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm going to Xiqi

132
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
to demand an answer

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,740
for Mocheng's late ruler.

134
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
So you

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,500
truly leave yourself no way back?

136
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,220
There has never been
a way back in this world.

137
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
The Phoenix Incense formula

138
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,840
is still missing a crucial catalyst.

139
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
I've heard

140
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,970
a black jade mine
was recently discovered in southern Xiqi.

141
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
In half a month,

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
I will return to Mocheng

143
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,840
with the Young Master of Xiqi

144
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
and the dowry.

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
May you remain safe

146
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,480
and return soon.

147
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,570
We respectfully see Your Majesty off.

148
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,880
Come, drink.

149
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Look, what's that?

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Someone's on the horse.

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,360
Be careful.

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,890
Alright.

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,080
It's His Highness.

154
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,940
Your Highness.

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Hurry!

156
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,560
General Lu.

157
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,200
General Lu,

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
His Highness is back.

159
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,250
Your Highness, you've finally returned.

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,680
We were worried sick.

161
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
That Demon Lord

162
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,330
has tortured you into such a state.

163
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,960
I failed to rescue you.

164
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,600
Please punish me.

165
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,980
General Lu,

166
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
that's too harsh.

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,640
Please rise.

168
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,040
Now

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
there's an important matter

170
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,540
that needs your preparation.

171
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,880
Please give your orders, Your Highness.

172
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,740
That Demon Lord

173
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,920
will depart from
the old southwestern isles,

174
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,770
cross the border a day from now,

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
and within three days

176
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
will pass through

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
the woods near Luo­wu Bridge.

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,380
Our chance to strike has come.

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Indeed, this is a rare opportunity.

180
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
We must eliminate her in one strike.

181
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,880
She was responsible for
the fall of Dongli,

182
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
and now she dares
seek an alliance with Xiqi.

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,040
She's heartless.

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,220
She should have been killed long ago.

185
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,720
Kill her!

186
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,590
Kill her!

187
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,520
Kill her!

188
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,550
Kill her!

189
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,440
Kill her!

190
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,340
Kill her!

191
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Kill her!

192
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,360
Kill her!

193
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,230
Kill her!

194
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,390
Kill her!

195
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,520
Kill her!

196
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
The Queen of Mocheng was
never decent to begin with.

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,600
She dares to come to Xiqi herself

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,330
with such shameless audacity.

199
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,220
Now it's us
she's put in an impossible position.

200
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,000
But the Queen of Mocheng

201
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,560
is indeed

202
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
an unmarried woman of the Feng clan.

203
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,100
Xiqi can hardly go back
on its word in public.

204
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
A so-called royal marriage.

205
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
No dowry, no political backing.

206
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,960
She's worth less
than even Feng Ling'er,
just a minor member of the clan.

207
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
I've come here

208
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
to form an alliance through marriage

209
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
with your Young Master

210
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,960
and

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,130
to plot greater designs together.

212
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,000
I am the Queen of a country.

213
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Since I've personally entered Xiqi
to claim the marriage,

214
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,850
it means I am here
to take your Young Master as my consort.

215
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,960
Please hurry back and report.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Tell him

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
to prepare his dowry and belongings

218
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,970
and marry into Mocheng.

219
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,960
I spare your life

220
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,820
only because you are an envoy.

221
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,480
But if another word of disrespect

222
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
reaches my ears

223
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
we'll see whether my future husband

224
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
is willing to spare yours.

225
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,520
Send word immediately.

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,180
Tell Young Master to prepare.

227
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes.

228
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,040
The journey to Xiqi

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,380
is uncertain, and danger lies ahead.

230
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
For Mocheng,

231
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,120
I have no choice
but to stake everything on this gamble.

232
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,280
I only hope mother

233
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,800
will bless me to survive this ordeal.

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
I suppose by now

235
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,160
he should be safe.

236
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Mr. Bai, please take a rest.

237
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,780
Your mother is here to see you.

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Mother, you came just in time.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please help me see

240
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
if the Queen would like these pastries.

241
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
She's grown tired of

242
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,520
the osmanthus mung-bean cakes
she usually eats.

243
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
These are all new recipes I've made.

244
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
When she returns,

245
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,770
I want her to try something new.

246
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,760
How much longer are you going to
busy yourself

247
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,290
with these useless things?

248
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,570
The Queen's trip this time…

249
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,720
I fear

250
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,880
she may never return.

251
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,450
She said it herself.

252
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,960
She said my mung-bean cakes
were her favorite.

253
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
She said she would come back.

254
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
She is the Queen.

255
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,880
She won't break her promise.

256
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
Come back?

257
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
Do you even know

258
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,200
what kind of savage land Xiqi is?

259
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,720
And that Young Master of theirs

260
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,450
is infamous for his brutality.

261
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Even if the Queen returns alive,

262
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
the title of future consort

263
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
will belong to that Xiqi barbarian.

264
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,650
What are you still clinging to?

265
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,000
By the Queen's side,

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
you'll have no place there.

267
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
Must my son

268
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,720
be destined to nothing more
than a secondary consort?

269
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
I don't care!

270
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
As long as she comes back…

271
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,960
As long as I can see her,

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm willing.

273
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,730
I'm willing to be a consort.

274
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Yu,

275
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
let it go.

276
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,300
If she doesn't return,

277
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,680
at worst,

278
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,540
I'll go to Xiqi to find her myself.

279
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Young master.

280
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,000
Keep an eye on the young master.

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,060
Without my orders,

282
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
he is not to leave the mansion at all.

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
Whoever kills the Demon Lord

284
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,840
will be richly rewarded.

285
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Your Highness,

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,400
what are you waiting for?

287
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,080
Your Highness!
