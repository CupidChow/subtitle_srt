[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,950
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,650
Yun Zhan has been
serving you quite attentively.

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Although Yun Zhan
has a willful temperament,

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,340
he wouldn't dare
neglect Your Majesty's order.

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,880
Is this wound new?

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,880
It was me who stole Your Majesty's favor,

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,640
so Yun Zhan resents me.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,360
Whatever beating or scolding I receive
is deserved.

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,320
I only hope

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,200
Attendant Yun

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,860
doesn't resent Your Majesty.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,120
Your Majesty,

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,560
this is freshly brewed calming decoction.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I heard you couldn't sleep at night,

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
so I brought this specially for you.

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,440
You're a new court lady?

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Yes.

19
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm Ruo, just transferred
to serve at the Fengxi Palace.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,039
I only arrived today.

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,479
I am apprehensive but honored

22
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,200
to have this duty.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,420
this decoction...

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
was prepared for you.

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
I pity his severe injuries.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,200
What's wrong with
granting him this bowl of soup?

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,820
The injury is on your body,

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,700
but the pain is in my heart.

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Here,

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,960
quickly,

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,200
drink it,

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,860
so you can sleep well tonight.

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
I don't deserve this.

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
This is poison.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,320
What should I do?

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
The little girl you've been
thinking of day and night,

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
whom you feel so indebted to,

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,840
is actually me.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I recognized you long ago.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,170
Never mind just a bowl of tonic,

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
once we acknowledge each other,

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
even the position of Imperial Consort
could be yours.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,320
do you mean it?

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Of course.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,640
Alright.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
I'll risk it.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
One bowl of medicine
for the position of Imperial Consort.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Worth it.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,400
I've been searching for you
so desperately.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,320
From now on,

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
I will never leave your side,

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
not even half a step.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Demon Lord!

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,140
Prepare to die!

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Watch out!

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,840
I never thought you would

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,700
sacrifice yourself to shield me.

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,650
Don't worry,

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,440
I won't leave you behind.

63
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,880
Your Majesty.

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
Are you treating my words

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,900
like they're nothing but air?

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,000
Just a mere male concubine.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
Who do you think you are?

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,540
Your Highness,

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,410
by what authority are you ordering me?

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Ridiculous.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,880
Let me go.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Let me go!

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,400
You love me so much.

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,280
Since we cannot share a bed in life,

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,720
perhaps we can share a grave in death.

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,780
Wouldn't that fulfill your wish too?

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,880
Every debt has its debtor.

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
She's the one you want to kill.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
It has nothing to do with me.

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,560
How could you say such heartless words?

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,660
Have you forgotten

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
the times we shared hardships
in our youth?

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
Does the Demon Lord
still hope for genuine feelings?

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
How pathetic.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
You, who willingly debase yourself,

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,400
have shamed

87
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,960
those in the underworld...

88
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Attendant Yun,

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
please put in a good word for me.

90
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
I knew you would come.

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Guards!

92
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
There's an assassin.

94
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
The assassin disguised as a court lady

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
and conspired with Yun Zhan

96
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
to assassinate me.

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,720
Arrest him

98
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
and take him to the death cell.

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,840
What did you say?

100
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,280
Yes.

101
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,000
Move!

102
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,690
[Wutong Palace]

103
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,860
Last night's incident

104
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,240
has left me heartbroken beyond words.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Attendant Xiao Ze

106
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
was truly my beloved.

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
He died in my chamber

108
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
protecting me.

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
My condolences, Your Majesty.

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,200
Attendant Xiao's loyalty and bravery
are evident.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
He died with honor.

112
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,159
Prime Minister Bai is right.

113
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,500
The brave and loyal

114
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,840
shall be recorded in our nation's history.

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
I will never forget this.

116
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Your Majesty,

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,720
according to our investigation,

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,600
the palace token
used by last night's assassin

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
came from the Fengling Palace.

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
Nonsense!

121
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Ling'er is my closest kin.

122
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,160
Someone must be framing her.

123
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,640
Your Majesty cares deeply for your sister,

124
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,400
but Princess Ling

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,060
has repeatedly
spoken disrespectfully to you.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Who else in Mocheng would dare be so bold?

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,490
We implore Your Majesty

128
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,200
not to aid the wicked.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,280
But the day after tomorrow

130
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,600
is the day when the Xiqi delegation
comes to receive the bride.

131
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,799
What shall we do?

132
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,640
You all make valid points.

133
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,289
Allow me some time to think.

134
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
For now, seal off the Fengling Palace,

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
guard it strictly,

136
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
and await the investigation's results.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Yes.

138
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,200
My Lord,

139
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,880
His Highness has been imprisoned

140
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
on charges of attempting
to assassinate the Queen.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,320
His life is in grave danger.

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
If they truly intend to kill him,

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
once His Highness loses his life,

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,520
the bloodline of Dongli

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,840
will end in Mocheng.

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Shall we raid the prison

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
and rescue His Highness?

148
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
Do not act rashly.

149
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Mocheng is heavily guarded.

150
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
His Highness is now
the personally designated rebel

151
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,800
by the Queen of Mocheng.

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,860
Do you really think

153
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,490
he could escape from there?

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,080
But if something happens to His Highness,

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
wouldn't our decade of planning
collapse overnight?

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,660
You think I don't want to save him?

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,240
He's the Crown Prince of Dongli,

158
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,760
the bloodline
I would protect with my life.

159
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
But now

160
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,700
is not the time for us to make our move.

161
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
If we move recklessly

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,210
and alert the palace defenses,

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,120
do you want to see
our decade of infiltration

164
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,780
and the sacrifice of hundreds

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,610
all exposed in a single day?

166
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
Yun Zhan is the Crown Prince.

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,210
He should understand what's at stake.

168
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,760
If the Queen wanted him dead,

169
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,620
she could have done it yesterday.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,260
The fact that she hasn't acted yet

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,440
suggests she might still
harbor some feelings for him.

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
This is our last chance.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,250
If the Queen shows no mercy
to His Highness...

174
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,530
Then he can only rely on himself

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
to find a way to survive.

176
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
From now on,

177
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,240
everyone proceeds as planned.

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,640
No rash actions.

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,560
If the Queen truly intends to kill him,

180
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,280
only then

181
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,760
will be the time for us to act.

182
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,680
As you command, Lord Lu.

183
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,380
It's the first time
I've seen you so dispirited.

184
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,360
How have you been lately?

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,720
Interesting.

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,730
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

187
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,800
The poison in your body...

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Don't worry.

189
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,540
I grabted all those

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,260
medicinal soup to Xiao Ze.

191
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
Not a single drop was wasted.

192
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
You knew it was poison,

193
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,960
and he was your old acquaintance.

194
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,020
Old acquaintance?

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,530
He was nothing but a coward.

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,410
When we parted at the wasteland years ago,

197
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
he didn't even leave me
a word of explanation,

198
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
just abandoned me.

199
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
His return

200
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,840
was merely to pay his debt.

201
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,720
So

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
you hated him,

203
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,720
toyed with him,

204
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
then killed him with your own hands.

205
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,960
Those who betray me

206
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
have only one fate.

207
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
Death.

208
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,360
So that's it.

209
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Your Majesty,

210
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,760
the envoy from Xiqi
has arrived at the palace gate,

211
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,160
requesting an audience.

212
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,480
Also,

213
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,890
it's time to send him on his way.

214
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,280
I see.

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,360
You have indeed
shaken my heart several times.

216
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,400
After we part today,

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,490
we shall never meet again in this life.

218
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,360
[Wutong Palace]

219
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,920
Announce the Xiqi envoy for an audience.

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
Your Majesty,

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
you've been delaying our departure

222
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,640
and now imprisoned Feng Ling'er.

223
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,960
Feng Ling'er
is the future Princess of our state.

224
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,800
This marriage alliance

225
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
concerns diplomatic relations
between our two states.

226
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,050
Your Majesty's actions

227
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,360
are clearly deliberate delays.

228
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,200
Moreover,

229
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,160
isn't this all too calculated?

230
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
Princess Ling is suspected of
colluding with assassins

231
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,360
and is now detained
by the Justice Department awaiting trial.

232
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,920
You demand her release.

233
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Are you trying to shelter a rebel,

234
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,720
colluding with Princess Ling

235
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,240
to take my life

236
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,360
and then get Mocheng

237
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,440
as a dowry to your Xiqi?

238
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Xiqi wants a marriage alliance,

239
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,480
not interference
in governance or accusations.

240
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,040
If you refuse the marriage alliance,
you'll be breaking our agreement,

241
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
showing complete disregard for Xiqi.

242
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,640
You'd better consider

243
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,300
the consequences carefully, Your Majesty.

244
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,950
[Liuyun Palace]

245
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,760
It looks as beautiful
as Sister's back then.

246
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
It's exactly the same,

247
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,520
yet why don't I feel

248
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,840
as happy as Sister did back then?

249
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,200
What's still missing?

250
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,320
A child.

251
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,560
Li.

252
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,320
Your Highness, please spare Li.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,280
You and the late Queen were twin sisters.

254
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,120
Li shares

255
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,640
the same blood

256
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,960
as you.

257
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,240
Yu,

258
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,290
you're being too careless.

259
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,720
Does it hurt?

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,560
Li isn't like Sister.

261
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,700
She's more like me.

262
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,880
She's arrogant, ruthless,

263
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,480
and extremely calculating.

264
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
I love her deeply,

265
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
so how could I let her disappear?

266
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
I just want

267
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,840
the Phoenix Incense's formula
and the Phoenix Seal.

268
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
I want to experience

269
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,800
everything Sister once had.

270
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,180
Do you understand?

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm giving you another chance.

272
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,880
Be her Imperial Consort.

273
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,720
After marriage,
the Queen and her Imperial Consort

274
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,560
will jointly hold the formula.

275
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,200
Are you willing to join her

276
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,040
in this beautiful union?

277
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,840
I...

278
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,400
May I?

279
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,140
But Her Majesty...

280
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
You love her so much.

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,020
Of course I will find a way to help you.

282
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

283
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,960
But now,

284
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,720
you need to help me with one thing.

285
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,920
What is it?

286
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,920
My man

287
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,280
is still missing a pair of eyes.
