[Wutong Palace]

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,480
You're here.

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
your heart meridian has just stabilized.

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,539
Don't force yourself.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
The matter of making the incense

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,210
can wait for a while.

10
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,560
Although I have the formula,

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,690
I've never personally made it before.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,039
Currently, the Slave House case
remains unsolved.

13
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,240
Only by making this incense
as soon as possible

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,800
can we silence the gossip.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,330
It's strange to say,

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,280
but after I ate

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,920
the pastries you delivered yesterday,

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
I felt much more at ease.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,759
Really?

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,009
If you like them,

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,210
I'll deliver them to you every day.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Why isn't there any rice wine today?

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
I...

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,880
still want more.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,400
You...

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,330
drank that wine yesterday?

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,500
How much did you drink?

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
Did you feel any discomfort?

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,700
I only had a couple of sips.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
I accidentally spilt it.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
What a pity.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
It was my oversight yesterday.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,600
You haven't fully recovered yet,

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
and I still brought the wine.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,880
Once you're better,

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,540
I'll drink heartily with you.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Okay.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
You eat too.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,690
Use the Phoenix Incense's formula

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,180
to exchange for the antidote for Feng Li.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Among all the court officials,

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,010
you're the only one I can trust.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
Only with you here

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,920
do I feel most at ease.

45

Your Majesty.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
For the road ahead,

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,560
you must also stay by my side
and walk it with me.

This is...

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
This is the Phoenix Incense's formula?

Bai,

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,170
you're the only one I trust.

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
With 2 ingredients missing,

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,120
it'll be an incomplete incense formula.

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
It should be enough to humor Meng Wu.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Li,

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,460
don't blame me.

For the restoration of Dongli,

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,140
this minor injury is nothing.

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,040
Once we succeed,

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I will surely crush all her fingers.

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
Young Master, your hand...

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,120
It's nothing.

You've worked undercover
in Mocheng's imperial palace for years.

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
You understand the situation

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,420
in the palace better than I do.

74
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,170
And you have more connections.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,120
Have you heard of anything

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,650
about the Slave House case?

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
This is internal strife within Mocheng.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
Your Highness, if you intervene

79
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
for Mocheng's queen,

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,530
it might arouse suspicion.

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,140
I have my own plans.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Everything must serve the bigger picture.

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,980
I've overstepped the bounds.

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,240
If you want to continue
to investigate the Slave House case,

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,100
you might find clues at one place.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,120

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
The Yueying Cave.

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,460
Your Highness,

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,860
What have you done to Her Majesty?

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
It seems Jiang Zimo

96
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,640
is indeed loyal to her.

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't worry.

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240

you deserve your reputation.

103

You actually disguised yourself
as a gardener

104
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,130
and found your way here.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,320
Looks like

106
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,820
this is Princess Royal's territory.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,640
What happened at the Slave House
was your doing.

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
So what if it was?

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,420
Stone King of Hell,

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,440
you shouldn't be here.

Princess Royal and I

112
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
already reached an agreement.

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,400
But the agreement

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
doesn't state

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,820
you can trespass into the forbidden area

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,970
to pry into Princess Royal's secrets.

117
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,760

Concealing your identity,

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,280
intentionally approaching Her Majesty,

121
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,210
what exactly are your intentions?

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Naturally, the same as mine:

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,600
to take Her Majesty's life.

124
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Rao Jun, you guilty official,

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
stop it now.

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,800
How dare you address Her Majesty
by her name directly?

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
You're so bold,

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,680
secretly establishing a forbidden area
in the palace.

130
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Feng Li,

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,050
do you really think you've won?

132
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
Even though you've discovered this place,

133
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,840
it's all in vain.

134
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Rao Jun, how insolent!

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
You're still defiant even at death's door!

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
How dare you commit such cruel acts!

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,700
With so much blood in this blood pool,

138
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
besides the slave case,

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,520
you must've been directed by someone else.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Tell us the truth!

141
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,840
Who ordered you?

142
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,559
I just killed some slaves.

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't be anxious.

144
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,280
Next will be you all!

145
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,540
Your Majesty, be careful!

146
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,450
I've had enough of those filthy slaves

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,050
and you, the debauched
and unprincipled Demon Lord!

148

Feng Li,

149
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,200
you're a disgrace to Mocheng.

150
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
What right do you have to be the queen?

151
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
You're even willing to burn yourself

152
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
in order to protect her.

153
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
Is it worth it?

154
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Everything was done by me alone.

155
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,660
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

156
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Now...

157
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
I want all of you to die with me!

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Majesty, go!

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,500
Your Majesty, the fire is too strong!

160
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,120
Your Majesty, please leave!

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Jiang Zimo!

162
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,570
Yun Zhan!

163
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,720
Your Majesty, don't!

164
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
Come out, both of you!

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
How laughable!

166
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Feng Li,

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,240
do you really think your lover

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
is a good person?

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,320
He is

170
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
the one in this world

171
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,920
who wants to kill you the most!

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,240
Your Majesty, go!

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,480
Your Majesty, go now!

174
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,200
What a touching scene of mutual devotion.

175
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,680
I'd like to see

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,760
how long you can

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
keep this act up.

In the netherworld,

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,050
I'll be waiting for you.

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Feng Li,

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,010
at this life-or-death moment,

183
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
are you really not going to call my name?

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,680
Yun Zhan.

185
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,550
Your Majesty.

186
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,640
Your Majesty!

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,520
Hurry!

188
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Put out the fire!

189
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,400
Hurry!

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Don't worry. I won't leave you.

191
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
We must survive together.

192
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,500
Give this to me!

193
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Be careful!

194
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,880
Hurry!

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
The fire is too strong!
We need more water!

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,200
Those who hurt or abandoned me
all deserve to die.

197
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Your Majesty,

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,820
the big fire in the Yueying Cave
has been extinguished.

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,020
Have you found the bodies?

200
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Your Majesty, my condolences.
