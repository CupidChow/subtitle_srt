[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,000
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
How insolent!

4
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,020
Since you're so eager, Young Master,

5
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
I definitely won't let you down.

6
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,570
Hiding and covering up to this extent—

7
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
could it be that Young Master,

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
your face is hideous

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,560
and you're worried I might mock you?

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Young Master, you played with me

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
in the water just now,

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,340
yet you didn't get wet.

13
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,040
You're wearing a mask.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
So this mask is...

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
It seems this is the real

16
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
Young Master Yao.

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
You.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,120
Take off your mask.

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Or else...

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,160
Both of your similarly handsome faces

21
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,920
please me.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,620
Those who have seen our true faces

23
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
cannot leave alive.

24
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,140
I wasn't planning on leaving anyway.

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Assassin! Catch the assassin!

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,720
Assassin!

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
After them! Catch the assassin!

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
Anyone trespassing into
Young Master's Mansion

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,480
shall die!

30
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
What audacity!

31
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,210
How dare you trespass into my mansion?

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Hand over Feng Li to me.

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
Interesting.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,079
It was already rare enough
that the Queen of Mocheng

35
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,200
would offer herself willingly.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
Yet now, some brazen madman

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
dares to intercept my wedding with her.

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Daring to steal someone from me—

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
I'd like to see

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
if you really have what it takes.

41
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,220
Quite impressive skills.

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,450
But you're both injured and poisoned.

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,460
You can't possibly defeat me.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
No matter what,

45
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I still

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,640
have to try.

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Since you've ruined the auspicious hour

48
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
of our wedding night,

49
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,280
I'll execute you

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,159
and then take your head

51
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,360
to ask the Queen

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,490
exactly who you are.

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,780
Young Master, why go to such trouble?

54
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
I'm right here.

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
If you have something to ask,

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,440
just go ahead.

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,920
He's just a male concubine

58
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
I once favored.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Leave with me.

60
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Leave?

61
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
Where to?

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
The groom and I

63
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,650
are deeply in love at this very moment.

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
It's our wedding night,

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,480
so I'll spare your miserable life.

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
Leave at once,

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,060
before you embarrass yourself further.

68
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
Well said.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Our wedding night
is too precious to waste.

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,640
If he still refuses to leave,

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,560
-then let him stay outside the door
-Leave.

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,880
and listen for himself

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,080
just how loving and blissful
the Queen and I are together.

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Feng Li!

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,480
Young Master wasn't fooled by that Queen.

76
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,360
Right now,

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,560
he's surely got her pinned beneath him.

78
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
You truly are quite devoted,

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,970
yet you ended up getting cast aside
like a worn‑out shoe.

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
If it were me,

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,640
I'd have been too ashamed
to still be here.

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
Shut up.

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,500
How dare you talk back?

84
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,600
You think this is Mocheng?

85
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Who do you think you are,

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
coveting our Young Master's woman?

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
We, King of Hell's servants,

88
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
await Your Highness's command.

89
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Dispose of them completely.

90
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,200
Why are you here?

91
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
I told you

92
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,860
I'd never leave you again.

93
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Is doing all this for me really worth it?

94
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
I've failed you once.

95
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,900
I won't fail you again.

96
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,400
Those who stand in my way

97
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
shall die.

98
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,560
So what if I stop you?

99
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
You...

100
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,420
Couldn't you be a little gentler?

101
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,480
You are...

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
You are...

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,740
You are the Stone King of Hell?

104
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,480
Stone King of Hell?

105
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,240
The Stone King of Hell and his Rakshasas

106
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,040
are famous chivalrous bandits

107
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
who take only the heads of evildoers

108
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,120
and have never failed.

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,620
They once roamed the borders of Xiqi,

110
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
righting wrongs and punishing the wicked,

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,440
appearing without a trace
and vanishing like shadows.

112
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,370
I only knew you were quite capable.

113
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,730
I never expected

114
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,200
you to be a bandit leader

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,460
with a sense of honor and righteousness.

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,010
Enough about me.

117
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,160
Tell me

118
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
what really is going on

119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,820
between you and these two masked people.

120
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
Young Master Yao of Xiqi

121
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,450
is skilled in martial arts,

122
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,970
while Young Master Miao

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
is frail and often ill,
unable to take care of himself.

124
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
So he is the real Yao.

125
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,580
You're right, Stone King of Hell.

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,820
The Young Master of Xiqi
is actually a princess?

127
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,520
What's really going on here?

128
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,600
Yao.

129
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,250
Are you alright?

130
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
No wonder you two siblings

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,640
have always worn masks in public

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,960
and claimed to be sick since childhood.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,360
I knew something's off.

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
I never expected

135
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,720
that my husband would
turn out to be a princess.

136
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,530
Since you already had your suspicions

137
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,620
yet still dared to come to Xiqi alone,

138
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,160
you must have had a plan in mind.

139
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,360
Knowing this secret

140
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
does put my life at risk.

141
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,720
Killing me would be easy,

142
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
but you siblings' secret

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,920
will inevitably come to light one day.

144
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,960
My husband, can you really kill everyone

145
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
in the world to keep it hidden?

146
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,960
I came to Xiqi

147
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
to make a deal.

148
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Since I was willing to come in person
for this political marriage,

149
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,160
it proves that

150
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
whether my husband

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
is a man or a woman,

152
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,360
we are in the same boat.

153
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
My two husbands,

154
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,280
why not hear out
the bargaining chip I have?

155
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
It may just be enough

156
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,140
to save all three of our lives.

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,680
Miao, let's hear

158
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,800
what the Queen of Mocheng has to say.

159
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,380
It won't be too late to decide afterward.

160
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,650
Then I'll have to trouble you, my husband,

161
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
to put on an act with me.

162
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,800
What kind of act?

163
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,480
The wedding night.
