00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,940
[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,560
Help!

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,160
The Princess has killed someone!

4
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,800
Help!

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
Blood

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,000
is not hot anymore.

7
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,550
[Episode 1]

8
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,020
The late ruler died suddenly.

9
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:39,760
[Mocheng, slave, Jiang Zimo]

10
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
This new empress could
let the Princess Royal

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,680
go against everyone's objections

12
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,740
to bring her back from the wasteland.

13
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,420
She must be quite formidable.

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,680
We've been selected
as her male concubines.

15
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,079
I wonder whether it's
a blessing or a curse.

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Fate is in heaven's hands.

17
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,920
[Mocheng, slave, Yun Zhan]

18
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,840
For now,

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,160
you should worry about whether you can

20
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,579
catch the Queen's eye.

21
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,790
[Feng Li, Queen of Mocheng]

22
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,079
You're freaked out
by some chicken blood.

23
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,920
How dare you claim to be premium goods

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,120
carefully selected by the Slave House?

25
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
Is there not a single

26
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
strong and brave man

27
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
in Mocheng?

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
Your Majesty, why do you
treat us like animals

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
and mock us?

30
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,280
[Bai Yu, son of Prime Minister Bai]

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,079
Humans and animals are the same.

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Both are driven by desire.

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
That was just the appetizer.

34
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,560
Tonight,

35
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
you are the main course.

36
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,480
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,880
You!

38
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Bai.

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Missed.

40
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,300
Don't rush, Your Majesty.

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,770
The one who remains tonight

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,680
will enjoy wealth and glory.

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,040
Unfortunately,

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
there can only be one.

45
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,480
Witch!

46
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,610
You killed your own father.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,220
And now,

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,480
on your late mother's death anniversary,

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
you're being ruthlessly cruel.

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,760
We will

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
kill you even if it costs us our lives.

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,520
On the path to the underworld,

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,800
you won't have peace.

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
Bai!

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Got it!

56
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Why aren't you fighting?

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,500
Are you waiting for death?

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Bai.

59
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,520
Is my archery posture correct?

60
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,410
Your Majesty, you could raise it
a bit higher.

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,480
My archery skills are terrible.

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
When aiming at prey,

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
you need to balance your strength

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,650
and nock the arrow with composure.

66
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Only then can you achieve perfect form.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
What's your name?

68
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Yun Zhan.

69
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,960
Yun Zhan?

70
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,320
You're the slave chosen
by the Princess Royal?

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,180
How can this be?

72
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Everyone else refers
to themselves as servants.

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Why didn't you?

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Aren't you afraid of me?

75
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,100
I am indeed the man
chosen by Princess Royal.

76
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Her Highness is
the regent of Mocheng

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,320
and Your Majesty's aunt.

78
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
If you're not afraid of her,

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,660
what should I be afraid of?

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Interesting.

81
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Come closer.

82
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
Dare you offend me?

83
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,490
Your Majesty, don't you prefer

84
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,820
someone different from the rest?

85
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
On the late ruler's death anniversary,

86
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
she is being so depraved.

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,680
I truly don't understand

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
why Your Highness went against
everyone's wishes

89
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
to make her Queen.

90
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,320
According to the laws of Mocheng,

91
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,000
the legitimate daughter takes precedence.

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
No matter how great
Feng Li's mistakes are,

93
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
[Meng Wu, Princess Royal of Mocheng]

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,120
this position

95
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,960
belongs to her.

96
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,280
[Rao Jun,
the Princess Royal's trusted subordinate]

97
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,720
But if she dies,

98
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,860
I won't have to follow
this stupid rule anymore.

99
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,940
I haven't obtained
the formula of Phoenix Incense yet.

100
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
Behave yourself.

101
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,120
Your Highness.

102
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
Your slave, Yun Zhan,

103
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,980
has been taken by Her Majesty…

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Yun Zhan.

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,160
Where are you from?

106
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,290
Once I entered the Slave House,

107
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,460
I have become a person without roots.

108
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,500
Where I came from doesn't matter.

109
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,200
It's weird.

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
There are no slaves

111
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,690
with such good martial skills
in the Slave House.

112
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
You are from Dongli?

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
Ten years ago,

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,680
Dongli lost to Mocheng

115
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
and became a vassal state.

116
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,800
The emperor and his son were killed.

117
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
People from Dongli dream of killing

118
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
the Queen of Mocheng.

119
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,140
I don't believe you don't hate me.

120
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
You're right.

121
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,400
I am indeed from Dongli.

122
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,680
You want to kill me?

123
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,800
No.

124
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I want to live.

125
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
I want to live with dignity.

126
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
The hairpin is sharp.

127
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,770
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

128
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
In Dongli,

129
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
not everyone

130
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,640
is

131
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,260
a desperate rebel
trying to restore their country.

132
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,160
Interesting.

133
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,420
Then you have to

134
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,720
serve me well.
