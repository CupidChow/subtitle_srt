[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,880
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
It wasn't easy for me

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,650
to bring you back alive.

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Why don't you cherish it?

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,460
I wish you well, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,080
If you haven't seen enough, Your Majesty,

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,140
you can come closer

9
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,000
for a better look.

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
Perhaps I should.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,160
You're someone

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,260
I can't quite see through.

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,850
Why did you save Jiang Zimo?

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
He works for you.

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Do you think I would believe

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
you saved him for my sake?

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
Then how am I supposed to treat you?

18
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,079
It wasn't easy for me

19
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,960
to bring you back alive.

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,490
If you don't believe me,

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
I can

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,300
disappear from your sight

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,720
forever.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
The fire last night was huge,

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,740
burning fiercely.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,420
At that moment,

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,260
I was just thinking

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
that if Jiang Zimo died,

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,980
you'd surely be heartbroken.

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,360
I can't bear to see you

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
grieve over another man.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,290
If this was some ploy to gain sympathy,

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,880
it worked.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,120
Does it hurt?

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Your Majesty.

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Jiang Zimo is awake.

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,930
I'll be right there.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Guard Jiang has burns all over his body,

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,480
and his throat has inhaled too much smoke.

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,340
He's temporarily lost his voice.

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,160
As long as he's alive.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
Can he still move?

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,440
Well...

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,079
Besides the burns on his body,

45
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,720
Guard Jiang also bears injuries
from torture.

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Right now, even moving a finger

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
is difficult for him.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,570
He'll need time to recuperate.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
That venomous woman Rao Jun—

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
letting her die like that

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
was too merciful.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
It's all my fault

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,490
that you ended up like this.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,580
Your Majesty, please don't blame yourself.

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
The one who harmed him was Rao Jun,

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,760
and whoever was behind her.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,880
Why are you here?

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
You took so long to come back.

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,610
I'm also a patient who needs your care.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,160
Since you didn't come back to me,

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
I had to come find you.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,640
What's wrong?

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,120
Are you in pain somewhere?

64
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
Perhaps his wounds are too painful.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
I'll brew some soothing medicine

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
to help him feel better.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Okay.

68
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,960
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,850
It seems Guard Jiang

70
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,360
isn't feeling well.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,060
Maybe we should go back

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
and leave him to rest.

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
That's not a bad idea.

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,280
Rest well.

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,020
I'll come see you another day.

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's go.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Let's go.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
You're awake.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,520
I've brought you some medicine.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
This medicine

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,320
should be taken while it's still warm.

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
You're with them.

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,020
Why did you save me?

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm not taking

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,440
this medicine.

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
I only saved you

87
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,810
because I didn't want her to be sad.

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Drink this.

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
It's better for both of us

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,820
if you can't speak.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Come on,

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,690
open your mouth.

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,370
Open your mouth!

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,580
Your Highness.

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Feng Li...

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
She's not what she seems.

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,460
Your Highness, please be extra careful.

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Of course.

99
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,520
She's my sister's child—

100
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
she carries the same blood as I do.

101
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
She did…

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Well.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I...

104
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I, Rao Jun,

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,740
can't keep you company anymore, Sister.

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
Rao Jun, you're the only one

107
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
who calls me sister.

108
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm very pleased.

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,840
It's just...

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
I care for you,

111
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,780
so I want to release you from suffering
as soon as possible.

112
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
Good girl.

113
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
Rest in peace.

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
You don't deserve to call me sister.

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,820
Your Highness.

116
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,760
What's this?

117
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,200
This is the key to the Queen's heart.

118
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,600
Keep it safe.

119
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,360
Li,

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,680
you'll like my grand gift.

121
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,490
Meng Wu, receive the imperial decree.

122
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,520
Princess Royal's personal maid,

123
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,080
Rao Jun,

124
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
established illegal prisons,

125
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
harmed loyal and upright officials,

126
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,560
and slaughtered the innocent.

127
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,600
Her crimes are unforgivable
and deserve death.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Princess Royal, Meng Wu, has failed to
govern those under her authority,

129
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,320
bringing disorder to the inner palace.

130
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,330
She's hereby sentenced to
3 months of confinement.

131
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,640
[Imperial Decree]

132
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,040
Without imperial summons,
she is not to leave her residence.

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,000
Prime Minister Bai, you truly
deserve your reputation

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
as a veteran of three reigns,
even coming in person

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,680
for such a trivial matter
as delivering a decree.

136
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
Without loyal officials like you,

137
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Mocheng's foundation
would surely be shaken.

138
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm merely doing my duty.

139
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm just concerned for you.

140
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,600
The imperial court is a perilous place.

141
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,240
Do you truly believe that
clinging to these rules

142
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
will guarantee you
a lifetime of safety and honor?

143
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,360
I act justly and stand upright,

144
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,320
with nothing to answer for
before heaven and earth.

145
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
What is there to fear?

146
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
The shaman once divined

147
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,640
that Mocheng would one day
face a great calamity.

148
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,520
I wonder

149
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,820
where this calamity will strike.

150
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Rao Jun's crimes are severe,

151
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,400
and she's Your Highness's trusted maid.

152
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,960
Her Majesty shows great virtue
in honoring familial bonds.

153
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,890
I hope Your Highness can
choose your words with care.

154
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,570
[Imperial Decree]

155
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
My dear Li,

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
you've truly grown capable.

157
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,010
Now that you've given me
such a grand gift,

158
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
how should I properly repay you?

159
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,460
Lift your head.

160
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Your appearance is quite pleasing.

161
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
Take him away!

162
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,920
Tonight, you'll learn

163
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,640
how to wag your tail.

164
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm merely a wanderer from the wasteland,

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,160
of lowly birth.

166
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,520
I...

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm unworthy to meet a noble gaze.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
Besides, my heart has long been
spoken for.

169
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,480
You dare refuse me?

170
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Then I'll rip

171
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,300
that heart of yours out

172
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,610
and see exactly whom it belongs to.

173
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,040
Someone!

174
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
Strip him of his clothes!

175
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
So much for that pretty face—

176
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,120
turns out there's such an ugly scar
on his back.

177
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,920
Indeed.

178
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,680
All shine on the surface, decay within.

179
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
My stone!

180
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Trying to escape?

181
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,180
What's this worthless thing?

182
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,400
What a grand display.

183
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,980
Greetings, Your Majesty!

184
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,320
Was stealing Aunt's slave
not enough for you?

185
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Now you want to take the one

186
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
I've set my sights on as well?

187
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,160
If that's what I want,

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,330
won't you let me have it?

189
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,040
Does it still hurt?

190
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,480
It's all my fault

191
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,400
for causing you to be left with

192
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,060
such a large, ugly scar

193
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,680
for the rest of your life.

194
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,760
That's not true.

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Look—

196
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,220
doesn't it look just like
the moon in the sky?

197
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
That's really something, you know?

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,480
Perhaps one day,

199
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,960
I'll rise to the heavens
and become an immortal.

200
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,920
And what if you just soar away?

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,840
I'll grab you and take you with me.
