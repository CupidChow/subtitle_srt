[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,070
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,770
Yun Zhan is the crown prince of Dongli.

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,320
Lu Ran was originally his subordinate

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,250
and infiltrated Mocheng long ago.

6
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,519
Under the banner
of restoring their country,

7
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,250
he had lurked for so many years.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,200
Now, Lu Ran has betrayed Yun Zhan
and colluded with Meng Wu.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
They persuaded Feng Li
to marry far away to Xiqi,

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
but they replaced her during the journey.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
The real Feng Li

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,039
has already fallen into their hands.

13
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm afraid her life is in danger.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,720
No wonder her eyes looked different.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
She didn't curse me

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,480
and didn't talk back.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,810
She isn't Feng Li at all.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,160
What should I do?

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,210
Meng Wu now has the Phoenix Seal

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
and has Lu Ran's assistance.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,160
And I guess most of the court officials
have already taken sides.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,820
With what power can I save her?

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Me, a royal woman alone?

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,610
And half of the Tiger Tally?

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,280
Feng Ling'er,

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,009
calm down and think carefully.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,080
There must be a way

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
to save Feng Li.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,039
I'm alone and weak,

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,479
but Xin Yao is the young master of Xiqi

31
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
and once formed an alliance with Feng Li.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,039
Perhaps

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,280
he is the only help

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,410
I can find right now.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,020
Feng Li hasn't been eating
or sleeping well lately.

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,810
She needs some medicinal tonic
to regulate her body.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,560
It's poisoned.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
This is bad.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,480
Princess Royal actually made a move
against Xin Yao.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,410
What should I do?

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,760
A-Aunt.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
Ling'er,

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,900
strolling in the garden at this hour,

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
aren't you afraid of seeing something

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
you shouldn't?

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Aunt,

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,760
I...

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,300
I didn't see anything.

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Really.

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
I just came out for some fresh air.

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,970
I had no idea... I'd bump into someone.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Ling'er,

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,880
don't be afraid.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm just teasing you.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,400
Even if you saw something, it's fine.

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,240
Haven't you always felt

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Feng Li is so high and mighty,

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,000
looking down on you?

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,160
I know you feel wronged.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,640
Your bloodline

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
is just as noble as hers.

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
It's time

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,210
for someone to fight for the justice
you deserve.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,720
Aunt,

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

66
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,840
On the wedding day,

67
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I will make sure you obtain

68
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,680
the honor you deserve

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,480
and become the true Princess Ling.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
Thank you, Aunt.

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
I won't let you down.

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
What I like most about you

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
is that you are sensible.

74
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,800
[Liuyun Palace]

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Lu Ran.

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,800
Remove his mask.

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,760
He has quite a handsome face.

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,800
Check again

79
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,820
if there's anything
that can prove his identity.

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,940
[Token]

82
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,020
Your Highness,

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,800
this token...

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,280
[Token]

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,610
is the credential of Xiqi's young master.

86
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,560
There is no second one like it.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm 100% sure.

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,810
So he truly is the young master of Xiqi.

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,130
I just searched the entire body

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,860
and found something suspicious.

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,600
This young master of Xiqi...

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
is a woman.

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
This person...

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
is actually a woman.

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,400
No wonder the young master of Xiqi

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
has worn a mask since childhood.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
So that's why.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,480
Xiqi's young master is a woman.

99
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,840
The young master of a state is actually
a woman disguised as a man,

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,240
hiding in the court.

101
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,520
If this is revealed to the world,

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,380
Xiqi will surely fall into chaos.

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
Once Xiqi is in chaos,

104
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,760
it will be the perfect time
for Mocheng to annex it.

105
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,760
A heaven-sent opportunity.

106
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,240
Aunt, clearly you're blessed by Heaven.

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,280
Xiqi

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
will be the next Dongli.

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Ling'er,

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,040
as long as you obey me,

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,610
a share of this world

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
will surely be yours.

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,520
As for this person,

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,520
before the wedding ceremony,

115
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
let her continue her act.

116
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Once the ceremony is over,

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,040
after we obtain the Phoenix Incense
and the puppet wood,

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,080
we can expose her identity.

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
Aunt,

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,920
she once spoke disrespectfully to me.

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,580
I've held a grudge ever since.

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,370
Why don't you...

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,120
leave her to me?

124
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,560
I'll ensure she won't cause any trouble.

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Okay, Ling'er.

126
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,890
Since that's what you want,

127
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
I feel quite reassured.

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,800
But you must remember:

129
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
don't harm her life.

130
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,200
Don't ruin

131
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
my perfect plan.

132
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
I understand.

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
I won't disappoint you.

134
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,060
Young Master of Xiqi,
you're finally awake.

135
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
This appearance of yours

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,320
is truly a rare sight.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
You removed my mask?

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Has the smoke addled your brain?

139
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,760
You were taken away by Meng Wu and Lu Ran.

140
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
They discovered your identity.

141
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
Out of kindness,

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
I asked them for you.

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,180
Otherwise,

144
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,080
you would've been tortured to death
by Lu Ran by now.

145
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,120
What... is this place?

146
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
My territory, of course.

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,260
The Fengling Hall.

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,560
Of course,

149
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,480
you're now

150
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
in my hands.

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Xin...

152
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Yao?

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,000
I am not Xin Yao.

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,180
My name is Xin Miao.

155
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,760
I apologize for offending you before,

156
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,220
especially in the palace.

157
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
For my rudeness,

158
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,320
I apologize. I was reckless.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm not that petty.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,159
But if you truly feel

161
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,200
guilty toward me,

162
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,080
after listening to what I have to say,

163
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,680
just cooperate obediently.

164
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,210
Last night, I went to the prison

165
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
and saw Yun Zhan.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
How is he?

167
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Is he still alive?

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,860
We agreed before entering the palace

169
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
that he would enter as a criminal slave

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
and then find a way to escape

171
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
to reunite with us.

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
But now there hasn't been any news.

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,400
He was tricked by Lu Ran.

174
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
Originally, they were on the same side,

175
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,919
but Lu Ran betrayed him long ago.

176
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,690
Now he's colluded with Meng Wu,

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,809
planning to take Feng Li's life

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,460
and seize power in the Wutong Palace.

179
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,080
Yun Zhan told me to come to you.

180
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
He said only you can save Feng Li now.

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
The real Feng Li...

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,920
was already replaced by Lu Ran

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
during your journey back to Mocheng.

184
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
The one waiting

185
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,160
for your wedding in the palace now

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
is an impostor.

187
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
No wonder.

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,520
I always felt something was off.

189
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,080
Where is Feng Li now?

190
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,140
Is she still alive?

191
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,820
I think she's still alive,

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,360
but I'm afraid
she won't hold on much longer.

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Lu Ran and Meng Wu will make their move
sooner or later.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Or perhaps...

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,560
they'll simply end everything

196
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,620
on the wedding day.

197
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,120
If you truly want to save her,

198
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
do as I say.

199
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Go to the Apricot Blossom Study
in the west of the city,

200
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,810
and embed a stone in a crack in the wall.

201
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,760
If my brother sees it,

202
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,200
he'll know I'm sending a message.

203
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
Your brother?

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
The real Xin Yao?

205
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,320
That's right.

206
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,600
Before coming to Mocheng,

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
we agreed

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,520
I would appear openly in male disguise,

209
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
while he'd remain hidden.

210
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,010
If danger arises, he would save us.

211
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,720
He's a skilled strategist.

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,400
We might

213
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,460
be able to solve this problem.

214
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,260
Princess Ling,

215
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,400
now we can only rely on you.

216
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,250
Greetings, Your Highness.

217
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,900
Your Highness.

218
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,920
Li's big day is approaching.

219
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
What a pity.

220
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
Sister,

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,560
you won't be able to see it.

222
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,880
[In Memory of The Late Queen of Mocheng]

223
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
Sister,

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
look.

225
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,360
The last time the palace was this lively

226
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
was during your wedding.

227
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,760
Now,

228
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,560
it is finally awash in red again.

229
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,760
You were the legitimate daughter
of the Feng family.

230
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,200
You were the queen revered by all.

231
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,400
While I was

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480
merely a shadow.

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,000
All those years,

234
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,800
I learned to walk like you

235
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,290
and imitated your way of speaking.

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Every single detail about you—

237
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,280
no one knows better than I do.

238
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,520
When you smiled,

239
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,840
the entire palace rejoiced.

240
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,880
But when I shed tears,

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,200
no one even bothered to ask.

242
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
Soon,

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,360
someone

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
will put on the wedding dress
that should have belonged

245
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,040
to your daughter.

246
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,800
She will take Feng Li's throne,

247
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
her husband,

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
and everything else.

249
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
Just like me back then,

250
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,240
she'll become

251
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,520
a shadow that no one...

252
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,640
cares about.

253
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
Sister,

254
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
this is my revenge against you.

255
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,160
This time,

256
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,440
I won't lose again.
