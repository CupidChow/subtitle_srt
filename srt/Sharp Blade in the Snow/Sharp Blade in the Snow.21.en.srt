[Episode 21]

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,240
Yun Zhan!

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,760
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,280
Yun Zhan!

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,800
Your Majesty!

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,260
-Yun Zhan!
-Your Majesty!

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,920
Yun Zhan!

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,720
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,690
Yun Zhan!

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,850
Yun Zhan!

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,250
Hurry up!

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
Search the eastern area again.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,520
They couldn't have gone far.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,280
Yes!

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
Young Master,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
we've searched all surrounding woods

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
but found no trace of them.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,450
Keep searching!

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes!

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,560
Someone's by the river!

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,760
It's... Her Majesty!

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,160
What happened?

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,490
We were ambushed

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,980
by assassins on the way

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,210
and unfortunately fell into the lake.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm glad you're fine.

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,720
Let's carry Her Majesty to the carriage

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,080
and take her to the nearest post station.

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,960
-Okay.
-Guards!

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,520
Hurry!

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,360
Careful.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,050
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
Wake up.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,880
Wake up.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,140
Feng Li, you're awake.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,690
Are you feeling unwell?

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Don't be afraid.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm here with you.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,930
No one will harm you.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,690
She doesn't look right.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,620
What's wrong with her?

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,290
Her pulse is rapid,
with blood flowing backward.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
She must have

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,480
fallen into water, caught a chill,
and been frightened.

47
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Her vocal cords are damaged

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,079
and she's lost her voice.

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,900
Lost her voice?

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
What should we do?

51
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
We'll leave for Mocheng immediately

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
to find the best doctor to treat you.

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,800
A long delay may cause trouble.

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,560
We'll rest briefly

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,880
and then set out for Mocheng at once.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,740
As you command.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
We'll soon reach Mocheng.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,900
Stone King of Hell,

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm afraid you'll have to endure
some hardships once we reach there.

60
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,480
It's all for Her Majesty.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
No matter what happens,

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,490
proceed according to plan.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
Faster!

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,370
Don't delay
Princess Royal's important matter.

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,050
Mission accomplished.

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Your Highness,
I've brought the Queen for you.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,080
Li,

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
you're finally back.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Take a look.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
This little thing

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
has finally reached my hands.

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,340
What's wrong with her?

73
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,240
She was fed a bowl of bewildering soup

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,370
and has temporarily lost her mind.

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,800
If she becomes a fool,

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,460
how will I get the Tiger Tally?

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
This is only temporary.

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
Within a few days,

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,810
she'll gradually regain consciousness.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
Li,

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,440
will you give the Tiger Tally
and Phoenix Incense formula

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
to me?

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,730
You won't tell me, will you?

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,120
Let me try.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
Fingers are very sensitive.

86
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,490
One prick with the knife...

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
Even if she doesn't speak,

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,680
she could still write something down.

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,040
She's my own niece.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,100
How could I let you harm her in any way?

91
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Li, you've been obedient since young

92
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,050
and have always listened to me.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,840
You just haven't figured it out yet.

94
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
Everything I do

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,840
is for your own good.

96
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,480
Once you understand,

97
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,340
you'll hand over
the Tiger Tally naturally.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,680
Princess Royal, a report from the front:

99
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Young Master of Xiqi
will return to the palace

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,730
with Her Majesty tomorrow.

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,360
We have guests coming.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Come.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
My sweetheart,

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,040
you need to hide for a while.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,600
I care for you so much.

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll find the most suitable place

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
to keep you hidden.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
Don't worry.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
I'll find someone

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,600
who will love you dearly

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,320
to play with you every day.

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,280
Alright?

113
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Li?

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Li.

115
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Li!

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,490
It's really you.

117
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Li,

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
you're back!

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
You're back.

120
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry, Li.

121
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,640
I offended you.

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,130
Don't be afraid.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,890
I won't touch you again.

124
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,159
I'm just

125
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,200
so happy you're back.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,260
What's wrong with you?

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Why aren't you speaking?

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,050
Are you feeling unwell?

129
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
What happened to your throat?

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
Who did this to you?

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,700
What did they do to you?

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Was it Meng Wu?

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Tell me.

134
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,520
Was it Meng Wu?

135
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,480
Was it her?

136
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm not blaming you.

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
I was just so afraid.

139
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
So afraid that...

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,840
you would never come back.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
It's okay.

142
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,159
This is fine too.

143
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,240
This way you won't run away.

144
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,799
If you don't speak,

145
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,520
you can't argue with me.

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,800
You'll never run off to

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
places where I can't see you.

148
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,920
You finally

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,640
belong only to me now.

150
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
My sweetheart,

151
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,520
how did you come back from Xiqi

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,120
so thin?

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,840
Your voice is damaged too.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
It really breaks my heart.

155
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,520
Li,

156
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,120
I've brought

157
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,440
your favorite pastries.

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,160
Here.

159
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
Try this.

160
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Take your time.

161
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,480
I heard you two were inseparable in Xiqi,

162
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,940
and you accompanied her
on the journey back.

163
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,040
Now Li's ended up like this.

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,400
Is this how your Xiqi

165
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,640
treats the guests?

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,600
Her Majesty and I get along very well.

167
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,440
Everyone in Xiqi treats Her Majesty
with the utmost respect.

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,360
However, on our way back,

169
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
there was an accident.

170
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,280
Her Majesty accidentally
fell into the water

171
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
and lost her voice due to the cold.

172
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,600
Who was so careless

173
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,360
to let Li suffer such harm?

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
Are your guards in Xiqi

175
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
just for show?

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
The culprit responsible

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,400
for Her Majesty's fall into the water

178
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
has already been sent back to the capital.

179
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,610
Bring him in.

180
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,840
So it's you,

181
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
Yun Zhan.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
You, a lowly male concubine,

183
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
secretly followed the Queen to Xiqi.

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
How incredibly loyal

185
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
and devoted of you.

186
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,360
I always keep my promise.

187
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,240
Your memory serves you well.

188
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
You speak of promises,

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,720
but who knows
what you've promised to whom.

190
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Your Highness,

191
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
you're still so forgetful.

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,810
If you've truly forgotten,

193
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
I don't mind refreshing your memory.

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Take him away!

195
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,810
Don't be afraid, Li.

196
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,770
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
If anyone makes you suffer,

198
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,970
I will have them torn to pieces.

199
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,520
This man is yours to deal with.

200
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
As you command.

201
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
Don't let him die too quickly.

202
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
I've just met that Queen.

203
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,760
I don't know where you found her,

204
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,440
but she looks remarkably similar.

205
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
If her temperament wasn't so different,

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,040
even I'd have been fooled for a moment.

207
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,400
She's just a village woman

208
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,680
who happens to have a useful face.

209
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
Being of even a little help
to Your Highness

210
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,440
is her greatest honor.

211
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,280
This plan is brilliant.

212
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,160
That mute woman

213
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,320
has now become my obedient niece.

214
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,800
I've also found the person you wanted.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,040
You must keep your promise.

216
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
Rest assured, Your Highness.

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,120
I will do my utmost.

218
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
By the way,

219
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,840
that Young Master of Xiqi is elegant,

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,880
but he has never removed his mask.

221
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,440
Do you think under that mask

222
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,000
is the real Young Master?

223
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,340
I've had my doubts as well.

224
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,840
It's said the Young Master of Xiqi
has been frail since childhood

225
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,800
and must wear a mask to ward off evil.

226
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
He does the same in Xiqi.

227
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,320
Few have seen his true face.

228
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Go investigate.

229
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,660
If he truly is the Young Master of Xiqi

230
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,000
and falls into our hands,

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,930
he'd certainly be a valuable pawn.

232
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,460
If we can take advantage and secure Xiqi,

233
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
then Mocheng and Xiqi

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,280
will truly become one family.

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,640
As you command.

236
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,320
I will thoroughly investigate

237
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
the identity of the Young Master of Xiqi

238
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
and won't miss any useful weakness.

239
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
What do you mean, Feng Li?

240
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
You came back without telling me

241
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,680
and even dared to lock me in the mansion.

242
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
I heard you were sick

243
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,160
and became mute.

244
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,970
Well, I won't go easy on you.

245
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm here to scold you,

246
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,480
not to apologize.

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,940
These days when you were away,

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,130
Aunt came to my place every day.

249
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,840
Now it's just the two of us here.

250
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
No one can hear us.

251
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Stop pretending.

252
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,040
Why are you acting?

253
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,960
You're mute,

254
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
not an idiot!

255
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,760
Why are you so cowardly?

256
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,260
Who are you really?

257
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Did you put on a human skin mask

258
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
to impersonate Feng Li?

259
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Feng Ling'er!

260
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,900
Have you had enough of this nonsense?

261
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,520
So what if I'm making a scene?

262
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,800
She's the one
who came back with an attitude,

263
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,960
playing the victim.

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I just hate her.

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,170
Princess Ling,
time to return to your residence.

266
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,930
If you continue this behavior,

267
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,780
the consequences
will be worse than just house arrest.

268
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,840
Aunt, go ahead and protect her.

269
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,200
One day,

270
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
I'll make her beg me on her knees.
