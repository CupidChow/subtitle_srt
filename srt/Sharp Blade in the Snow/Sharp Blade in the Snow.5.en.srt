[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,070
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,520
[Princess of Mocheng, Feng Ling'er]

4
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Feng Li,

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,960
Yun Zhan is the slave Aunt chose!

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,220
What right do you have to possess him?

7
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,520
It's you, Ling'er.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
It's been many years,

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,560
and you're still as rash

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
as ever.

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
This slave truly has some skills.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
No wonder Princess Royal likes him.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,130
Would you like to try, Ling'er?

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
Feng Li!

15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,680
You...

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,490
You're ridiculous!

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Now Mocheng's Queen

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
is me.

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,560
Not to mention one slave,

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,759
even if I wanted 10

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,060
or even 100 slaves,

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,370
Princess Royal
would have to obediently give them to me.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,930
Even Aunt didn't say anything.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,040
Who do you think you are?

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,680
How dare you come
to my palace to ask for him?

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
You...

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
Just you wait!

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
Yun Zhan.

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,420
You really are Princess Royal's man.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
A man too beautiful

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
is indeed a jinx.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
I heard Feng Ling'er

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
barged into Wutong Palace recently

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
to stand up for you.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
And she had a fierce argument
with that wretched girl.

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,240
Now everyone in the palace knows

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,100
that the new ruler is ridiculous.

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
She even took her aunt's slave.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Now,

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,120
people will trust even less

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
this wild girl who was exiled for years.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
Sister,

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
in your heart,

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,920
who

45
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,650
was the most important person?

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,440
Besides the nation and the people,

47
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,840
did I, your own sister,

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,860
hold even the slightest place

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,800
in your heart?

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,600
They all said

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,940
that the one you loved most...

52
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,720
was him.

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,060
Your Highness.

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
They look so much alike.

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,240
Look

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,720
who I am.

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Master.

58
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,480
Sister.

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Look,

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,080
I also have

61
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
what you had.

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,960
Be careful.

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
These precious medicinal herbs

64
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,620
are all to be delivered to the palace.

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
If there's even one tael missing,

66
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
I'll dig out your hearts!

67
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,640
The nobles don't like you,

68
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,840
so you're only fit for hard labor.

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm talking about you!

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,000
You slave, how dare you defy me?

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
It seems
you haven't tasted enough of the whip!

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
Let me go!

73
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Trying to escape?

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,240
Men's blood isn't pure enough.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Only women's blood

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,200
is the holy essence for nourishing men.

77
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,560
We must achieve

78
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,240
killing two birds with one stone.

79
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,750
[Slave House]

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,620
Murder!

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,990
Murder!

82
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,040
[Blossoming in Fraternal Glory]

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Those slaves

84
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,120
are utterly treasonous!

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,200
They actually brutally slaughtered

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
all the female officials in charge.

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,160
And now their whereabouts are unknown.

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,400
We should control all men

89
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
with the Phoenix Incense.

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
But since the former ruler,

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,120
this incense has never been made again.

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
During the heavy rain 10 years ago,

93
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
the Incense Pavilion
was struck by lightning.

94
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,720
All the incense has been corrupted.

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,560
It is now completely ineffective.

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,280
Yes.

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,000
The Phoenix Incense is passed down
through generations of queens.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,320
Your Majesty, you must prepare in advance

99
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,250
to guard against any eventuality.

100
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,000
Now, everyone fears to go out,

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,460
terrified of the rioters.

102
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,080
For the peace of Mocheng,

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,140
Your Majesty,
you should make preparations early.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
According to Mocheng's ancestral rules,

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,640
we should worship our ancestors
and select an auspicious day

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,970
before making incense.

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Lord Diviner.

108
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,960
I have performed the divination.

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
The hexagrams indicate

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,800
that three days from now

111
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,440
will be an auspicious day.

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
Your Highness,
you're in such high spirits today.

113
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
Do you want us

114
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,690
to devise some new diversions for you?

115
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,400
I heard

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,440
you are the most robust men

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,280
in the Slave House.

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Only you are qualified

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,050
to play this interesting game with me.

120
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
We

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,500
will not disappoint you, Your Highness.

122
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,360
Do you know who you are

123
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,440
and where you are now?

124
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
Now,

125
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
I want you to turn around

126
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
and stab each other.

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,220
Your Highness,

128
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,810
looks like we've succeeded in developing

129
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,360
our own Phoenix Incense.

130
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
It seems

131
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,800
it still isn't time for Feng Li to die.

132
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
I have researched for years,

133
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,920
but have never been able to figure out

134
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,720
the Phoenix Incense's formula.

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,280
The effects of these imitations
can't last long.

136
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
Before long,

137
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,800
these men's dispositions

138
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,400
will become out of control.

139
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,640
Sister,

140
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
you said

141
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,920
you'd share everything with me.

142
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,480
But you kept the incense formula from me.

143
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
You liar.

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
Be patient, Your Highness.

145
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,360
Soon enough,

146
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
Feng Li
will hand over the Phoenix Incense.

147
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,530
By that time,

148
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,140
the entire Mocheng

149
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
will be yours.

150
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,440
Li,

151
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
the Phoenix Incense they kept mentioning—

152
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,720
what exactly is it?

153
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,290
The Phoenix Incense...

154
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
It's said it's a type

155
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,890
of evil incense developed by an ancestor.

156
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Evil incense?

157
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,280
In the past, in Mocheng,

158
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
women were bullied and humiliated by men,

159
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,810
without dignity or status,

160
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
living in deep misery.

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,940
The ancestor was good at making incense.

162
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,700
So she used the black jade,

163
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,520
which grows in the dark,
deep places of Dongli,

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,450
as the catalyst,

165
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,480
and accidentally developed

166
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,280
a type of medicinal incense

167
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,340
that can control and manipulate men.

168
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,840
It's said this incense
has many wondrous effects.

169
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,600
Therefore,

170
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,840
it's passed down
only to successive rulers.

171
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,200
Then is the incense's formula

172
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,840
in your hands?

173
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,080
When I was a kid,

174
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,410
my mother made me memorize it thoroughly.

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,370
Actually,
the difficult part isn't the formula,

176
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
but rather

177
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,320
the catalyst called black jade.

178
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
Its properties are peculiar.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,480
It easily catches fire
when exposed to flames.

180
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,640
Many years ago,

181
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,240
during the war between Dongli and Mocheng,

182
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
a massive fire

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,260
burned all the black jade in the mines

184
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
into ashes.

185
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,940
It is said that back then, Dongli,

186
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
under the pretext
of forming a marriage alliance,

187
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,280
intended to invade Mocheng,

188
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,720
but ended up being destroyed
by Mocheng instead.

189
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,380
The fire in Dongli
burned for 3 days and 3 nights.

190
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,250
Dongli and Mocheng
had always been on good terms.

191
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,760
Many years ago,

192
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
Dongli's crown prince and I

193
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,080
were just kids.

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,330
How could they use that as an excuse

195
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,560
to invade Mocheng without warning?

196
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
Dongli was truly daydreaming.

197
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,320
From the moment you were born,

198
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,760
you were destined
to be the queen of Mocheng.

199
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
No matter how well they planned,

200
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,360
even though it was Dongli's crown prince,

201
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
he was nothing but a fledgling kid.

202
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,060
How could he ever be worthy of you?

203
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,960
It was Mocheng
that specially sent a letter,

204
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,040
seeking a marriage alliance with Dongli
as a gesture of goodwill.

205
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,520
To show sincerity, my father

206
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,160
brought me along to Mocheng
for the meeting

207
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,490
and marriage alliance.

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,330
Yet in their mouths,
it was a different story.

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
What exactly happened?

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,920
Miss Rao Jun,

211
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
you always like to surprise people.

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,840
I was just playing

213
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
a little joke with you.

214
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,770
You planted me by Demon Lord's side

215
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,360
and used my name
to heavily suppress Demon Lord,

216
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,620
causing controversy.

217
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,800
Do you want my life

218
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
or Demon Lord's life?

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Or is Princess Royal simply greedy,

220
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,240
wanting both?

221
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,120
Stone King of Hell, you misunderstand.

222
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,320
We did that

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
just to make Demon Lord

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
completely drop her guard against you.

225
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
Besides,

226
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,420
Princess Royal
believes in your capabilities.

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,680
I came here this time

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
to tell you

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
Demon Lord won't live much longer.

230
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,120
We hope you

231
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,040
quickly gain her trust

232
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,440
and obtain the Phoenix Incense's formula.

233
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,040
This way,

234
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
a million taels of gold and her life

235
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
will both be yours.

236
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,160
Very well.

237
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
But in this deal,

238
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,420
if you don't keep your promise...

239
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,690
Stone King of Hell, what are you doing?

240
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,200
When to take her life

241
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,740
is for me to decide.

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Don't forget...

243
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,880
that is the promise you made to me.

244
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,300
Stone King of Hell,

245
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
I advise you

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
not to be bewitched

247
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,080
by Demon Lord.

248
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Why are you still up at this hour?

249
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,240
With matters weighing on my mind,

250
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,570
of course I can't sleep.

251
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,800
May I help ease your worries?

252
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,720
They pressured me

253
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
to make the Phoenix Incense.

254
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,890
I'm sure you've heard about it.

255
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,620
I still need a piece of black jade.

256
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,740
Do you know where I can find it?

257
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
Being so direct,

258
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,900
aren't you worried...

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,160
Worried?

260
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm worried you'll be reluctant
to see me die too soon.

261
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,520
Don't you want to know

262
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
who will have the last laugh?
