00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,950
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,610
Why are you looking at me like that?

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,920
You're the one insisting on protecting

5
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
that filthy slave.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,440
Get over here now!

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm taking both this stone

8
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,160
and him.

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,050
Come with me.

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,840
Feng Li.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,520
Are you sure you want to take my stuff?

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,080
I am the ruler

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
while you are the subject.

14
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,640
Even if I demanded your head today,

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,759
you would have to offer it
with both hands.

16
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,820
How can you call it taking your stuff?

17
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,600
If you're still unsatisfied,

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,530
go find your aunt
at the Princess Royal's residence.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,199
You're hurt.

20
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,960
You'll get frostbite without shoes.

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,480
Let me help you put them on.

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
They all say I'm a bad seed

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,610
and a harbinger of misfortune.

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,290
Aren't you afraid of me?

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
Why should I be afraid?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,160
You are my friend.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
No matter who you are,

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
we will survive together.

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,400
Come on.

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Have you ever seen

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
a little boy at this height

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,100
with a red dot on his forehead?

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,160
That guy

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,120
is a bastard from Dongli.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,940
He just escaped from our mine yesterday.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,040
This wasteland

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
is full of wild beasts.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,690
Once he's out there,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
it's impossible for him to survive.

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,200
What?

41
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,780
Are you afraid of pain?

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,440
I am just a lowly servant.

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,120
How could I deserve
Your Majesty's personal care?

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,930
So, you are afraid of me, right?

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
I am not.

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
It's just that...

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Your Majesty, you seem to be
quite different

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
from the rumors.

49
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
What am I like in those rumors?

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
It's said

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,880
that you are cruel and unpredictable,

52
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,340
killing without remorse.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
But in my eyes,

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
you are a gentle person.

55
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,210
Would you be willing to stay by my side?

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,860
I have already given my heart to someone.

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't wish to use my appearance
to gain favor.

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,040
Tell me

59
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,320
what kind of person she is.

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,130
When I was young,

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
I was stranded in the wasteland

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
where I met a little girl.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
We swore to be together forever.

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,159
But later, due to some accidents,

65
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,960
I broke my promise.

66
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,490
Even the only token was stolen by thieves.

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Since then,

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,300
I've never seen her again.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,520
No wonder the black jade ended up

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,650
with the courtesan.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
So, you mean

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
you want to reject me

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
for a woman

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
whose whereabouts are unknown?

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,850
All these years,

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I've never given up looking for her.

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,920
I believe

78
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
I will find her again.

79
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,860
I want to fulfill the promise
we made when we were young.

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
I won't let her get hurt again.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,930
[You've already found me.]

82
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,960
It's my fault.

83
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,060
No, it's not like that.

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
I was moved

86
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,840
by your story.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,240
What's your name?

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,680
I didn't have a name originally.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Later,

90
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,960
when I was adopted by my foster father,
who is a hunter,

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,280
he named me Xiao Ze.

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Xiao Ze.

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,300
That's a good name.

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
From now on,

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
you'll stay by my side.

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,280
Don't worry.

97
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,760
I won't force you to do anything.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,360
I hope

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
you can find your little girl soon.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
I can never repay your kindness.

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
I will be diligent

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,770
and serve you wholeheartedly.

104
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
When you're with me from now on,

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,250
don't take yourself as a servant anymore.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I have a request

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,840
that I risk my life to ask.

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,940
Your Majesty, please help me.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,159
Speak.

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
That stone

111
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,520
is the only keepsake

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,890
that little girl gave me

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,240
when I was at the wasteland.

114
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,440
Your Majesty,

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
please return that stone

116
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,240
to me.

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
Keep it safe.

118
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,120
Who exactly

120
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,320
sent this impostor

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,640
to approach her using my name?

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
Xiao Ze.

123
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,020
Were you kicked out by Her Majesty

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
and lost your soul?

125
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,020
You can't even walk straight.

126
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,050
Of course I'm not

127
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,720
as good at fawning on others as you,
Mr. Bai.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,980
What a waste of effort.

129
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,490
Now that Her Majesty

130
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,980
has a new lover in her arms.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,290
She probably has no time for pastries.

132
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,560
Seems you've truly fallen out of favor.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,440
You're nothing special after all.

134
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,900
I'm still better than you,

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,640
who never even had the chance
to lose her favor.

136
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
By the way,

137
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,300
that night,

138
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,880
thanks for

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,679
your Phoenix Drunk wine.

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
It finally let me experience

141
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
what it's like when Her Majesty

142
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,280
throws herself into my arms.

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,210
What did you say?

144
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
Not only do I know,

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,919
but Her Majesty also knows

146
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,960
there was something wrong with that wine.

147
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,220
She didn't punish you.

148
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,200
It means you

149
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,360
are still something for her.

150
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,130
You were with Li that night?

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,940
We were not only together,

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
but we also...

153
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll kill you!

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,880
You worthless slave!

155
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,980
Is this all you're capable of?

156
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
How can you protect Her Majesty?

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
Mr. Bai.

158
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
You should be vigilant about

159
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
someone else.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,730
Instead of watching me all day,

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,730
you'd better

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
check Her Majesty's chamber.

163
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,180
If you're too late,

164
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
it will be all over.

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,930
Just leave it there.

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,920
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
the physician said

169
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,600
if the medicine gets cold,

170
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
it won't be effective.

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm afraid it's too hot.

172
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,250
I'll drink it later.

173
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Your Majesty,

174
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,940
let me cool it down for you.

175
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,160
Your Majesty,

176
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,820
the medicine has cooled down.

177
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Get out of the way!

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

179
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm perfectly fine.

180
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,760
You worthless slave!

181
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,440
Bai.

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
How dare you force medicine on
Her Majesty!

183
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Bai.

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
He was just trying to give me medicine.

185
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,560
You were too rough.

186
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Are you hurt?

187
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,090
I'm okay.

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,200
But

189
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,810
Your Majesty's medicine spilled.

190
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,680
Your Majesty,

191
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,320
the man with unclear origins

192
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,050
shouldn't be kept by your side.

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
You're truly overthinking.

194
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
Her Majesty saved me from dire straits,

195
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
so I owe her my life.

196
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,690
I've long heard that

197
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,400
Mr. Bai and Her Majesty grew up together.

198
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
If you dislike me,

199
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,400
I'll leave.

200
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Your Majesty, I only hope that you

201
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,840
won't develop any ill feelings
toward Mr. Bai because of this.

202
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Who do you think you are?

203
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
How dare you sow discord
between Li and me?

204
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Enough!

205
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,720
He's just a poor man from the wasteland.

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,520
Look at all his injuries.

207
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,340
Why can't you tolerate
this pitiful person?

208
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
I love you

209
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,100
and my affection remains steadfast.

210
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,020
But what about you, Your Majesty?

211
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,840
I...

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Mung bean cake is cool-natured
and helps clear heat.

213
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,180
Remember to eat it, Your Majesty.

214
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
Bai.

215
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,680
Are you hurt?

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm okay.

217
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,490
You accepted everyone else

218
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,600
except me, huh?

219
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,920
Mr. Bai,

220
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,340
Princess Royal requests your presence.

221
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,280
What Sister loves most

222
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
is your eyes.

223
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
I just haven't found

224
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,800
what complements them.

225
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Now,

226
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,440
without Rao Jun's help

227
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
and blood nourishment,

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,960
I can't even maintain

229
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
your facade anymore.

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Your Highness, what do you want with me?

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
Come here.

232
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
You promised me

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
that if I handed over
the incense formula,

234
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,450
you would give me the antidote.

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,200
But

236
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,800
the formula you gave me

237
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
is fake.

238
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
I...

239
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
I

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
followed exactly how Her Majesty

241
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
made the incense that day...

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,920
Guess

243
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,240
how many days will it take for the poison

244
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
to reach Feng Li's heart

245
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,320
and how many days

246
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
can she live?

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,100
Your Highness,

248
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
I can give you anything you want。

249
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,090
But I didn't deceive you

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,730
in the incense formula.

251
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,600
That's not what I wanted to hear.

252
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,920
I must

253
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,160
give you a little

254
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
punishment.

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,320
I wonder if Mr. Bai's blood

256
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,760
is sweet enough

257
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
to satisfy him.

258
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Mr. Bai,

259
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
don't be stingy.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
Your blood is indeed sweet.

261
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
He likes it very much.

262
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,240
I am willing

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,410
to offer a cup of my blood every day.

264
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,640
I only want Your Highness to provide medicine

265
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,360
to ensure Her Majesty's well-being.

266
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,640
Since you begged me so earnestly,

267
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,920
how could I not grant your wish?

268
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
Thank you, Your Highness.
