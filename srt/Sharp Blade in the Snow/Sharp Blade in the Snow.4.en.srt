[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,930
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,680
It's cold.

4
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,570
Standing barefoot on the floor

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
will make you catch a chill.

6
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,360
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,200
Princess Royal heard that
your old illness has returned

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,530
and sent some medicine.

9
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,800
I'll do it.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,009
This medicine is poisoned.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,440
I want to see

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
if you'll really
drink this bowl of poison.

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,170
The Princess Royal certainly chose well—
you really know how to serve.

14
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
You've caused serious trouble.

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Tell me,

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,610
how should I punish you?

17
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Punishing me is nothing.

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,640
But if you catch a chill,
that would be serious.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Why not

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,040
let me help you change your clothes?

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,720
Now you're really in trouble.

22
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,760
Your Majesty, are you painting
red plum blossoms?

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,020
Do you like plum blossoms, Your Majesty?

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Yes.

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,170
My mother loved plum blossoms—

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
blooming in the cold,
proud and unyielding,

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
crimson like blood.

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,820
How captivating they are.

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
More captivating

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,120
than me?

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Serve me

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
well,

33
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
just like they do.

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,900
Who knows—I might even
grant you the title of High Consort.

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
We

36
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,810
have plenty of time ahead of us.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,640
The Queen truly favors Yun Zhan.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,120
The affection in her eyes
is almost impossible to hide.

39
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
With looks like Yun Zhan's,

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,680
forget the Queen—

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,080
even you and I couldn't help
being tempted.

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,800
Mr. Bai.

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Go.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Yun Zhan,

45
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,050
you'd better behave yourself.

46
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Such audacity.

47
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
The Queen's status is supremely noble.

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
She is no pleasure-seeking noblewoman

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,440
from the Slave House.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Know your place!

51
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,080
We've always been intense,

52
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,040
Mr. Bai.

53
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Who do you think you are?

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,760
You...

55
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
I may be nothing special—

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,640
just a bit spoiled by the Queen's favor.

57
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
I am the Prime Minister's only son,

58
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,400
born of a noble house.

59
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,860
Defying me is an act of insubordination.

60
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,200
If I wished,

61
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
I could take your life at any moment.

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,880
Then the Queen

63
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
would be heartbroken.

64
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,790
[Lu Ran, Medical Envoy of Mocheng]

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
I'm Lu Ran, death guard of Dongli,

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
pay my respects to Your Highness.

67
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Rise quickly.

68
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,760
You have fallen into exile,
hiding in the martial world

69
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,720
as "Stone Yama the Rogue,"

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,770
and have suffered greatly,

71
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
yet still had to

72
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,050
endure humiliation at Bai Yu's hands.

73
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
If he had not wounded me,

74
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,159
how could I have ever met you?

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,600
General Lu,

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,280
since the fall of Dongli,

77
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
you have remained
in the deep palace of Mocheng.

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,810
It is you who have been wronged.

79
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,120
For Dongli,

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
I will serve until death.

81
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,780
Your Highness,

82
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,560
now that you've
successfully entered the palace,

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
what is our next move?

84
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
Wait.

85
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Wait?

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Your Highness,

87
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,840
why change the plan?

88
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,970
Why not kill her now?

89
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,480
I've learned

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
that Feng Li possesses the formula

91
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
for Feng Condensation Incense,

92
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,690
which can control men's minds.

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,020
In Mocheng,

94
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
where women rule,

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,330
this evil incense has long
harmed the people.

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,540
We must wait for the right moment.

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,680
I will reclaim Dongli

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
and make Mocheng pay in blood.

99
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,360
I will also obtain the formula
for the evil incense

100
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
and wipe out
both the Demon Lord and that incense

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,640
once and for all.

102
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,560
[All Is for Benevolence]

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,240
Lord Meng Wu of Mocheng

104
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,960
instructed me

105
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,340
to add a small dose of poison

106
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,280
to the Queen's medicinal
decoction every day.

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,480
They scheme and vie against each other,

108
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,250
unaware that

109
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,560
you are the ultimate beneficiary

110
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
waiting in the wings.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
The Demon Lord is meticulous

112
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,340
and difficult to win over.

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,370
Perhaps this is worth a try.

114
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,520
You're here?

115
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Your Majesty, how did you know it was me?

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,480
Everyone carries a distinct scent—

117
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
especially you.

118
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Don't be nervous.

119
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,140
Just acupressure,

120
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,980
to dispel dampness and cool your system.

121
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,860
What are you doing?

122
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,480
Your Majesty,

123
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,960
your inner heat runs high.

124
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
While the tonic is strengthening,

125
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,330
too much of it

126
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,250
can aggravate your inner heat.

127
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,580
My temper has been raging lately.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,930
Perhaps killing a few
would serve to quell my temper.

129
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,850
That medicine is poisoned.

130
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
Really?

131
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
How could that be?

132
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
Who wants to harm me?

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,140
If you wish to soothe your temper,

134
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,000
perhaps

135
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,660
you'll allow me to try.

136
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,480
Try.

137
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,620
Your Majesty, then

138
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,730
you have to endure a bit.

139
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,840
You want me to...

140
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,920
What?

141
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Don't you like it, Your Majesty?

142
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
I just think

143
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,730
it lacks intensity.

144
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Father!

145
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,040
Father!

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Father!

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,160
Run!

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000

Father!

151
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
-Your Highness, go!
-Go!

152
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,820
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

153
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,720
Sit here.

154
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
Prime Minister Yun,

155
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,200
weren't Dongli and Mocheng

156
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,840
here to sign an alliance?

157
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,760
Why are they trying to kill us?

158
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Your Highness,

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,930
we've fallen into Mocheng's trap.

160
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,560
They never meant to form an alliance.

161
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
This was a ruse to lure us out
and silence us,

162
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,880
to kill both you and His Majesty.

163
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll fight them to the death.

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
Your Highness, you must not!

165
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,370
Change clothes.

166
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,380
Your Highness,

167
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,600
from now on,

168
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,440
you are my son Yun Zhan.

169
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,320
No.

170
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
How could I

171
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
trade someone else's life

172
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
for my own?

173
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,560
Cang Lin,

174
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,500
I was never meant to live long.

175
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,580
Only if you survive

176
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
will Dongli have a future.

177
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,620
Remember this—

178
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
no matter what happens,

179
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,840
you must live on

180
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,370
and restore Dongli.

181
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
Crown Prince Cang Lin,

182
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,180
I require you to swear an oath.

183
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,320
I swear in the name
of the Dongli royal house:

184
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,520
this debt of blood

185
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,880
will one day be repaid

186
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
by Mocheng in kind.

187
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,640
I haven't obtained world-ruining
incense formula yet.

189
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,760
She cannot die.

190
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Why did you stop?

191
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
Those pressure points are enough.

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,480
