00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:50,990
[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,990
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,060
Your Highness,

4
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,040
that wretched girl
coughed up blood again today.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,300
She's extremely weak.

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,730
I'm afraid she won't last much longer.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
But if she still refuses to hand over

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
the formula of Phoenix Incense by then,

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,640
then we'll...

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Who took it upon themselves

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,640
to replace the Red Plum
with Suoqingqiu rose today?

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,200
Your Highness, I...

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,880
In Mocheng,

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
every blade of grass, every flower,
every life and every death

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,160
is mine to decide—

16
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,039
including

17
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,440
Feng Li.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,080
Understand?

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
An important guest has arrived.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,200
Your Highness,
you said there was a way to save her.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,860
Please grant me the medicine.

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,600
Mr. Bai, you have always been
proud and untouchable,

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,530
yet now you're willing to
bow your head for the Queen.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,330
But you didn't
bring the prescription today.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,480
Let alone an antidote,

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,880
even…

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,560
Rao Jun.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
This medicine

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,420
can suppress the heart meridian
for three days.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,079
However,

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
where is what I asked for?

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,200
Mr. Bai, you should know—

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,520
once you and the Queen
are separated by life and death,

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,579
there will be no chance to meet again.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,520
So,

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
a formula in exchange for medicine.

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Mr. Bai,

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,980
that's a fair deal.

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,640
After all, I am Li's aunt by birth.

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
How could I

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,040
truly bear to take her life?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
She killed her father as a child,

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,640
and now lives in arrogance and indulgence.

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
Countless eyes are waiting for her death.

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,460
An aunt is a kind of mother as well.

46
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,000
As her mother,

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm protecting her.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Do you understand

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,280
my intentions?

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
This wine

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
is called Phoenix Drunk—

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
the best cure for sorrow.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,380
Since you love her to the core,

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll arrange things for you.

56
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,040
It's far better than letting her

57
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
keep getting entangled with those slaves.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,480
May you two be bound for life,

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
and share intimate moments.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,460
That day, Jiang Zimo said
he had found a lead.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,490
Now there's been no word at all—

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,920
something must have gone wrong.

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Your Majesty,

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,440
try these pastries I just made.

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,520
I added locust flower honey;

66
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,850
it's good for the lungs.

67
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,200
Bai,

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,930
have you heard anything about Jiang Zimo?

69
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,440
What could be more important
than your health?

70
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,930
At least have a few bites first.

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,090
Your cooking skills

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
are better than the royal chefs.

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm glad you like it.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
Wait.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Your Majesty,

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,580
please take care of yourself.

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,380
One or two sips won't hurt.

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,850
This wine is called Phoenix Drunk.

79
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
May you two be bound for life,

80
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
and share intimate moments.

81
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,840
Bai Yu, oh Bai Yu,

82
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,740
you're truly despicable.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
How could you betray Li's trust?

84
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,440
No.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,690
I mustn't do something so foolish.

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,860
The doctor has said

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,800
your condition isn't suited for alcohol.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,660
You really shouldn't drink this.

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,060
Why are you being so stingy today?

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,530
You won't even spare me a single flask?

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,659
I want it—and I'm drinking it.

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Your Majesty!

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
Your Majesty!

94
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Your Majesty!

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,240
Your Majesty!

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Your Majesty!

97
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Bai is from a noble family.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,730
He's never known hardship.

99
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,800
He's kind, pure,

100
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,920
and utterly sincere to me.

101
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,010
If I drag him into danger because of me…

102
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,780
I don't know if that's right or wrong.

103
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Give it to me.

104
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
You dare defy the Princess Royal's orders

105
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
and approach me.

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,289
Do you have a death wish?

107
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Your Majesty, you're drunk.

108
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm not drunk at all.

109
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
You drink too.

110
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Your Majesty,

111
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,940
you really have a way of

112
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,640
keeping me worried sick.

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,640
Let me get you some water.

114
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,640
Don't go.

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,620
It seems you're

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
still drawn to my warmth.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,880
There's a chill

118
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,720
in the air in Mocheng.

119
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,960
Your Majesty,

120
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
you're drunk.

121
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,720
Why are you avoiding me?

122
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,930
Your Majesty, you seem like

123
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
a different person today.

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,130
Something's wrong.

125
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
This smell...

126
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,280
There's something wrong with the wine.

127
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,080
I know you're all the same kind.

128
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,480
You want to use me up

129
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,440
and then discard me like a chess piece.

130
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,120
I must make the first move.

131
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,050
Are you sure you want to be so cruel?

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
Enough talk,

133
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
you miserable Stone.

134
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,840
Even you dare to abandon me?

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,100
I'm going to punish you properly.

136
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,090
You remember me now?

137
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,520
Feng Li,

138
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
who am I?

139
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
Stone.

140
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
Hold me again.

141
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,280
Please don't leave me again.

142
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,040
I won't.

143
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
If you wake up

144
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,130
and can still smile at me like this…

145
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,680
Look at you—a useless heap of flesh.

146
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,400
You're not even worthy to
be the lowest blood slave.

147
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,320
I wouldn't even bother to draw your blood.

148
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,240
You'd stain my pool.

149
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,380
You're nothing but Meng Wu's lackey.

150
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,680
You don't deserve to shout here.

151
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,360
You wretch!

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,700
How dare you speak of
the Princess Royal's name?

153
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,440
I'll drain you slowly.

154
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
I'll make sure you neither live nor die.

155
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
And you will watch with your own eyes

156
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,920
as the mistress you serve so faithfully

157
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,160
dies by my hand.

158
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,360
My lord,

159
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
only the living can
provide warm and nourishing blood.

160
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,840
If you keep beating him like this,

161
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
he may not survive.

162
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,920
Silence.

163
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,770
You little fool.

164
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,380
You actually tried to
steel your courage

165
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,850
by tricking me into
drinking Phoenix Drunk with you.

166
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,040
Since you've recognized me,

167
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,700
I won't hide from you anymore.

168
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,680
You're awake.

169
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Last night...

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Li,

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,240
I...

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
How dare you do that to me?

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Shouldn't I be the one

174
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,920
saying that?

175
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,290
Last night, you held me so tightly.

176
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
And now you wake up

177
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,650
and pretend that nothing happened?

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,040
Yesterday, you kept...

179
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,840
Shut up!

180
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,120
If I hadn't been drunk,

181
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,170
I would never have mistaken you
for someone else.

182
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Mistaken me?

183
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,810
You thought I was someone else?

184
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
This whole flask

185
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,400
would never be enough
to get me drunk on a normal day.

186
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,200
So how did last night turn out like that?

187
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,000
So,

188
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,080
you mistook me for Stone?

189
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,960
Shut up!

190
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
You're not worthy to speak his name.

191
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,940
So last night really
was nothing but a dream.

192
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,050
Yun Zhan,

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,940
you deceived the sovereign's heart.

194
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,300
You deserve death!

195
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Last night, we drank
this Phoenix Drunk together.

196
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
At the height of our closeness,

197
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
you called me by another man's name.

198
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,000
Was that

199
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,540
your careful test, Your Majesty?

200
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,060
Were you trying to
turn me into his replacement?

201
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
Have you said enough?

202
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,490
What are you even talking about?
That's impossible.

203
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,600
Your words

204
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
truly break my heart.

205
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,140
But that man

206
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
does deserve to die.

207
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,660
If you truly know nothing of this,

208
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,480
then perhaps you should think carefully

209
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
about who gave you

210
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
that wine.

211
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,960
Wait.

212
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,140
The doctor has said

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
your condition isn't suited for alcohol.

214
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,770
You'd better

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,970
not drink this wine.

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,520
I've always been indulgent and reckless.

217
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,560
You know that.

218
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,040
I only favored you a little more

219
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,920
because you resemble someone from my past.

220
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,250
Aren't you afraid of me?

221
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,920
Your motives

222
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
don't interest me.

223
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,320
You'll reveal it when you're ready.

224
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,520
What we have is nothing more than an act.

225
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
We each take what we need.

226
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,840
A word of advice.

227
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't get too caught up in it.

228
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,680
Did you really not recognize me at all?
