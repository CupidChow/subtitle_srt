[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,910
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,330
I've always been like this.

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,180
No need for your comments.

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Princess Royal has prepared

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
esculent swift's nest soup for you.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
I heard some noise outside just now,

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
and in my urgency,

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,800
I rushed in.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,960
Li.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,480
I am worried

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
that you might do something foolish.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,520
Mr. Bai,

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,289
today is Li's birthday.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,100
You shouldn't make her angry.

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,560
Li is still a little girl.

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,039
Now she is seeking pleasure.

19
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,100
But she will settle down eventually.

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
I was impulsive.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Sorry for my improper behavior.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
I'll take my leave now.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Aunt, you won't blame me
for being willful, right?

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
Indulging in pleasure in youth

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,640
is common.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,180
But you need to take care of yourself.

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,400
If you truly like him,

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
just have him serve you every day.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,160
Aunt, you love me so much.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,840
Li.

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
For you, I am willing to do anything.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,200
I hope you

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
understand my good intentions.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,000
Mr. Bai.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,540
Princess Royal requests your presence.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,320
Your Majesty, you truly have foresight,

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,079
knowing Princess Royal would come

38
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,740
to check on your whereabouts.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060
But your health...

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
It's nothing.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,890
Where's the box?

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
My mother left me

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
a piece of black jade.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Black jade.

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,920
It turns out the most important thing

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,380
has been with me all along.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
This is your pendant,

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,520
a keepsake from your mother?

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,079
Yes.

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Years ago, when I was secretly
banished to the wasteland,

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,400
I treasured it as my life.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
Later, I gave it to

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,329
a particularly important friend.

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
Now it is returned,

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
but that person...

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,090
you were banished
to the wasteland for years,

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
but no one knew.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,440
On the wasteland in the eastern suburbs,

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
there was a Phoenix Mountain

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
with 1,361 dead trees.

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,970
I guarded them for a full ten years.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
The wasteland in the eastern suburbs.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,420
Phoenix Mountain.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
If the young lady

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,760
leaves the water now,

67
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,000
not only will it fail to clear

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,480
the toxins in her body,

69
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,930
but it will worsen
the damp poison inside her.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm afraid

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,220
she won't survive three days.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Unless...

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,140
Don't move.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,980
What are you doing?

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
I want to save you.

76
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,620
This is insubordination.

77
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,080
Aren't you afraid I'll punish you?

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm not afraid.

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
If you were to die, Your Majesty,

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
that would be
the greatest punishment for me.

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,680
Let go.

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
What are you doing?

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,280
I

84
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,920
want you to live.

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
You must survive.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,880
Stone King of Hell's inner strength
is profound.

87
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
If you want her to survive,

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,600
use your extremely strong Yang energy

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,860
to neutralize the cold poison in her body

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
and then transfer half of the poison

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
into your body.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Perhaps

93
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,850
there might still be a chance of survival.

94
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,400
Let go.

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,200
No.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,210
Thanks, Your Highness.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
You're too kind to me.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Bai, you're
Prime Minister Bai's only son.

99
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Three generations of the Bai family
have served Mocheng loyally.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,040
You deserve it.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,420
You've cared for Li since childhood.

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
I've known it all.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
But today,

104
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,640
you've truly been quite improper.

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,760
Mr. Bai comes from a prestigious family.

106
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
You are elegant and handsome.

107
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
Besides, you and the Queen
are childhood sweethearts.

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
However, now Mr. Bai is outside,

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,480
while Yun Zhan is on her bed.

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,680
I even feel sorry

111
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,960
for you.

112
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,040
I have

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,000
no jealousy.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,640
But the Queen is frail.

115
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,040
If she indulges in pleasure daily,

116
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,700
I fear it will harm her health.

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
Mr. Bai, you're truly attentive.

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,780
You're concerned about Li's health.

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
Among all men in the world,

120
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,640
only you

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,680
truly care for Li.

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
But do you know

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,240
why Li is in poor health?

125
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Li

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,120
has been poisoned.

127
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,280
What?

128
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
Yes,

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,520
I did it all.

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
If you want to save her,

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,600
you might hear my conditions.

132
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,540
Trade the formula of Phoenix Incense

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
for Feng Li's antidote.

134
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
And persuade Li to take her poor health
as an excuse

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
to abdicate.

136
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,340
Then I'll ensure you and Li

137
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,040
remain together forever.

138
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
Your future

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,360
depends on you.

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,940
Your Highness,

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
this move

142
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,200
is quite risky.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Bai Yu is pure and innocent,

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,200
and completely devoted to Feng Li.

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,160
So, Feng Li's life for him

146
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,040
is our greatest leverage.

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,240
Aren't you afraid

148
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,700
Bai Yu will report this to Feng Li?

149
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
Who would believe him?

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,280
Don't you

151
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
agree?

152
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
Master, let me serve you to bathe.

153
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,550
[Wutong Palace]

154
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,000
Now that we meet again,

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,160
you've become my enemy.

156
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
It's ironic.

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Back then, you were just a child,

158
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
enduring the same suffering

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
as I did in the wasteland.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,060
There must be something fishy behind

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,660
the feud between Dongli and Mocheng.

162
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
You're awake.

163
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,280
How are you feeling?

164
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,340
Are you better now?

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,000
How dare you make decisions
on your own?

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,480
What are you smiling about?

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,340
Savoring last night's pleasure,

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
I feel joyful inside.

169
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Your Majesty,

170
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,720
Princess Royal has sent me
to deliver medicine.

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Your Majesty, don't be shy.

172
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
We must continue with this charade.

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,340
You're becoming
increasingly disrespectful.

174
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,440
Do you want to watch me in this way?

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,480
I dare not.

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,290
I didn't know you hadn't...

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
Indeed.

178
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
Aunt always cares for me the most.

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,860
Yes, Your Majesty,

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,340
the medicine should be taken while warm.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,520
Good medicine tastes bitter.

182
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,720
Let me try another way

183
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
to feed you, okay?

184
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,540
I'll take my leave now.

185
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
Are you crazy?

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,260
The medicine is poisoned.

187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,240
With so many people watching,

188
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,160
someone has to drink

189
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
this poison, right?

190
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,740
Self-sacrifice won't work on me.

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
Then, is this

192
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,760
enough to show my sincerity?

193
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,410
This was mine to begin with.

194
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,360
How can you give something away

195
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
and then take it back?

196
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,330
Aren't you afraid your old friend
to be heartbroken?

197
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,580
I can't let others take notice of him.

198
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
If he's still alive,

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,440
it could put him in danger.

200
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
What old friend?

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,720
That's all in the past.

202
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
For me,

203
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,960
what matters is this black jade

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,620
and the position of the queen.

205
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,720
Indeed.

206
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,850
With the black jade,

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,730
the next step

208
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,060
is to get the Phoenix Incense.

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
When the day comes to deliver the incense,

210
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,090
if you can't provide it,

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
your position

212
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,970
will be in jeopardy.

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,400
Within three days,

214
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
if we can prove that
the Slave House incident

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
was not caused by the slaves,

216
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,300
then there's no rush
to deliver the incense.

217
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,730
Those in the Slave House

218
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
are mostly obedient and timid.

219
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,760
How could they suddenly rebel and riot?

220
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,090
Is that credible to you?

221
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,640
Of course not.

222
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,680
I agree.

223
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,500
[Slave House]

224
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
These female officials died horribly,

225
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,640
and all their blood drained.

226
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,580
Look at the wounds on her face.

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
They appear to be caused
by clubs or sticks.

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,400
On her neck,

229
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
there's a fatal wound

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,220
pierced by a sharp weapon.

231
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,170
There are also wounds on her palms.

232
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,960
But why

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,600
was she stabbed?

234
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
It could be revenge.
