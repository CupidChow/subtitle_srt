00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,950
[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,900
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,120
What's wrong?

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,520
The killer

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
used iron nails to pin their palms

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,520
in place,

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,160
then pierced their throats.

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,520
So the blood

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
should have sprayed out.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,860
But look at this blood.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,940
It's more like it was splashed on.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Let's take a closer look.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
This isn't human blood.

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,160
What?

15
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,680
How's that possible?

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Then where did the blood
of those female officials go?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,460
Killing to harvest blood—

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,140
it definitely wasn't done by the slaves.

19
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,280
But those slaves have been
on the run till now,

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,240
with no trace.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,560
There's no way to verify it.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,289
So there's still no clue at all.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Look.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,760
This footprint is very unusual.

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Small and narrow in size.

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,039
It doesn't belong to a slave
or a female official.

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,000
The sand

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
mixed into it

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,040
comes from rare Ruizhou scorched soil.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,370
Something like this

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
can't be found anywhere for miles around.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
How could it appear here?

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Feng Li.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Little Beggar.

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,520
Demon Lord.

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,480
A child who was exiled and humiliated—

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,360
how could she possibly be

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,620
the mastermind who destroyed my Dongli?

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Absolutely ridiculous.

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Aunt.

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm scared.

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Li, it's all right. Don't be scared.

43
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,410
Back when I lived in the wasteland,

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,120
whenever there were
thunderstorms like this,

45
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,520
I would hide in the grass.

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Freezing rainwater

47
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,300
would rush down from the roof,

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,079
soaking my clothes through.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Thunder and lightning

50
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,600
would slip through the cracks in the door

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,130
and strike right by my ears.

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,120
At times like that,

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,680
wolves would lurk outside.

54
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
They were waiting

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,120
for the wind, driven by the storm,
to blow open

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
that shaky, crumbling door.

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
But now you've grown up.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,240
You are a supremely noble Queen.

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Living within an impregnable palace,

60
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,200
what is there left to fear?

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,400
Really,

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Aunt?

63
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,800
You are the apple of the eye

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
of my dearest sister.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Her most beloved daughter.

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
By my side,

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
you have nothing to fear.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Aunt.

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
Will you love me like my mother did?

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Good children

71
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
always make people feel tender.

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,220
Who goes there?

73
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,159
Your Highness, something's wrong!

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
Your Majesty?

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Everyone, stop at once!

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
Mr. Bai.

77
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,040
If you keep blocking us,

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,360
don't blame us for being rude.

79
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
The matter hasn't been investigated yet.

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
You can't take them away.

81
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,640
I'd like to see who dares.

82
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,720
Who?

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
Have you lost your minds...

84
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
What madness has seized you?

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,220
How dare you
draw your blades against my man?

88
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Are you all right, Bai?

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Are you hurt?

90
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,970
Greetings, Your Highness.

91
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
So late at night,

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
and it's this lively here—

93
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,940
for what reason, I wonder?

94
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
The heavy rain washed down
from the mountains

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,800
these half-rotted male corpses.

96
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,520
Mr. Bai repeatedly stopped us

97
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,050
from burying these bodies.

98
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,640
If they're not dealt with in time,

99
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,240
it could lead to an epidemic.

100
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
For something this important,

101
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,580
why weren't those fools stopped?

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
The Slave House case
hasn't been solved yet.

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,290
What if they really are
those escaped slaves?

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,620
They might still be carrying some clues.

105
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Right, Li?

106
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
I was negligent.

107
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,940
I deserve punishment.

108
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Over such a trivial matter,

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,760
you dared lay hands on my man.

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,730
Looks like you truly
have no regard for me.

111
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,400
You handled matters
so carelessly and incompetently.

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Your Majesty.

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
I think

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,800
from now on, the Slave House case

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
should be placed
under Mr. Bai's supervision.

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,880
I will follow your arrangements, Aunt.

117
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,280
The Golden Water is
at just the right temperature today.

118
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,120
As expected,

119
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,820
the freshest Golden Water

120
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,800
is the most nourishing for the skin.

121
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
Does it still hurt?

122
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,400
It was my negligence, Your Highness.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,600
I let that wretched girl
seize the chance to make trouble.

124
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,160
Feng Li

125
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,680
is more and more like a Queen now.

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
But the Slave House

127
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,960
is where we keep our blood stock.

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,970
If she were to...

129
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,400
There is no "if."

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Feng Li

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
doesn't have much time left anyway.

132
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
For us now,

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
what matters most

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,880
is to obtain Phoenix Incense's formula.

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
Since that Yun Zhan

136
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,840
has yet to succeed,

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,520
why not

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,650
try switching to another chess piece?

139
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,040
Your Majesty.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,680
Bai.

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Do you know what it feels like

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,250
to be burned by a branding iron?

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
A red-hot iron,

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,580
pressed against human flesh—

145
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,440
clothes and skin

146
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
stick together as one.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
At first, you won't feel any pain.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,480
But once the iron is lifted,

149
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,040
the charred skin

150
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,300
will be torn away together with the iron,

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,920
ripped right off your body.

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,520
At the beginning, you feel nothing.

153
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,330
That kind of pain...

154
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,200
No, Your Majesty!

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
No!

156
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,760
That kind of pain

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
cuts straight to the bone.

158
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,760
No!

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,000
No, Your Majesty!

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
No!

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
No, Your Majesty!

162
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,570
Is it beautiful?

163
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,080
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

164
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,520
Then this flower—

165
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,640
let me see where it should fall.

166
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,440
No!

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Your Majesty!

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,280
We were only following orders.

169
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,520
About what happened at the Slave House—

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,880
we truly knew nothing.

171
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,480
Look how frightened you are.

172
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Bai.

173
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,210
Since their mouths are sealed so tightly,

174
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
there's no need to keep them.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,240
It was Lady Rao Jun!

176
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
It was Lady Rao Jun.

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
She ordered us to deal with
and bury the male corpses.

178
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
She said

179
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
she feared an outbreak of disease.

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
We didn't dare think too much about it.

181
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,760
But—

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,040
about those matters
concerning the red soil,

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,840
we truly know nothing.

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,920
Why not question the Horticulture Office
and the female officials?

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
They work daily
at the Earth Storage Pool.

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,930
They must know something about this soil.

188
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,980
The Horticulture Office?

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
Cut out their tongues.

190
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Some names, once spoken aloud,

191
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,440
always come at a price.

192
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,800
No, Your Majesty!

193
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,960
No!

194
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,840
Your Majesty!

195
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
No!

196
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,280
Use Phoenix Incense's formula

197
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
to exchange for Feng Li's antidote.

198
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,640
Cite Feng Li's poor health

199
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,820
and ease her into abdication.

200
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Your Majesty,
these flowers smell wonderful.

201
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
I guarantee you and Feng Li

202
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,280
a lifetime together, just the two of you.

203
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
Your future

204
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,080
will rest entirely in your hands.

205
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,440
Bai.

206
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,720
Bai.

207
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
Don't blame me for being ruthless

208
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,370
and cutting out their tongues.

209
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,240
If they were still able to speak,

210
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,480
would surely kill them

211
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,880
to silence them.

212
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,810
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

213
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,090
I understand all that you've done.

214
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm only worried about your health.

215
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,880
You can't overexert yourself any longer.

216
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,680
Your Majesty.

217
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,600
Bai.

218
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't have much time left.

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't worry.

220
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,800
I will protect you,

221
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
keep you safe,

222
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,160
and never let you leave my side again.
