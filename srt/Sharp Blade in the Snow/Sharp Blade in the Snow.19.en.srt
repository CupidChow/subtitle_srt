[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

2
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,930
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,400
I thought

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,480
Xiqi forced you

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,960
into this political marriage.

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,440
But now...

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,720
The Queen of Mocheng is quite beautiful.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,680
But I'm also good-looking.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,200
She will marry into Xiqi.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Why don't you consider me instead,
Stone King of Hell?

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
You got me out of jail

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,010
and gave me freedom,

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,280
I'll help you out of this situation

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,010
and give you freedom in return.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,380
This marriage isn’t something
to play around with.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,880
The Young Master of Xiqi

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
has to return with me to Mocheng

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,240
as the Imperial Consort

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,440
to form an alliance through marriage.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,840
This is the only way to
protect both cities.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Princess Xin Miao is brave.

22
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,520
Young Master Xin Yao is wise.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,320
The Xin family is virtuous and kind.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,490
Even if it costs my life,

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,280
I will never let

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Meng Wu take control of Mocheng.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
For Xiqi

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,080
and Mocheng,

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,880
we must do this.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
Stone King of Hell, you are a righteous man.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
I hope you

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,980
can prioritize the greater good.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,300
Dongli has fallen.

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
I understand the pain of
losing one's homeland,

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,930
and the suffering of exile.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Li.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,380
Since you carry such righteousness,

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
I won't stop you.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,760
I'll escort you back to Mocheng.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,480
He is truly remarkable

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
and broad-minded.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,000
Since you two broke up anyway,

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
what about giving him to me?

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,880
Stone King of Hell is renowned

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,840
in Xiqi.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
We can negotiate.

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,140
If he can't marry me,
recruitment works too.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,760
I think you have no chance.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
But anyway,

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm quite satisfied

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
with my wife.

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,180
Now you're me, and I'm you.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,280
She

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,160
is my wife.

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,560
I thought

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,420
she was pushed by circumstances,

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,980
and forced into marriage.

58
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,140
But it turns out this was all her plan.

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,900
Stone King of Hell,

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Yun Zhan,

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,720
which one is your true identity?

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Both are.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Yet not entirely.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I like them both.

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Why are you so determined to die?

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
What do you mean?

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,570
If you return to Mocheng

68
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,570
and marry the Young Master of Xiqi,

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,810
at that time,

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,680
the Phoenix Incense formula,

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,200
the Phoenix Seal,

72
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,260
and the black jade,

73
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,290
will all appear.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
Meng Wu

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,880
will certainly try her best that day

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,920
to kill you.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,460
You want to trade your life

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,000
for Xiqi's power.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,260
Utilizing your marriage,

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
you want the Young Master of Xiqi

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
to eliminate Meng Wu for you.

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Am I right?

83
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,140
You've seen through everything.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
You set up this trap yourself

85
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,970
and put yourself in danger.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
How am I supposed

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,520
to save you?

88
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Mocheng

89
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
is the land

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,220
our Feng family has protected
for generations.

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Protecting Mocheng

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
and its people

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
is my duty.

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
That's all

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
I care about.

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
The Xin siblings are kind-hearted.

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
They won't make things difficult for
the new heir,

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
Feng Ling'er.

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
I will always be with you.

100
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,600
We will get through this.

101
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,280
So when do you plan

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,240
to tell me the truth,

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
Little Stone？

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
You did recognize me.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,920
You're the heir of Mocheng.

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,900
Why did you lie to me

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,920
that you were a wandering beggar?

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,250
Your lie hurt me deeply.

109
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,640
You betrayed me once,

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,450
and I deceived you once.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,120
Now we're even.

112
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,840
The trip back to Mocheng is dangerous.

113
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,159
This time, I must escort you back myself.

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,420
Don't say such foolish words.

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,840
In Mocheng,

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
you're considered dead.

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
What identity will you use

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,330
to return to the palace with me?

119
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,690
The powerful Stone King of Hell

120
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,170
came back from the dead.

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,810
That's not impossible.

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,440
Stone King of Hell

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,600
failed in his assassination attempt

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
and would be escorted back to Mocheng

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,810
to await your judgment.

126
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,820
[Fengling Hall]

127
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,920
Ling'er, you looks pale.

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
How are you recently?

129
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,560
Aunt,

130
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,880
why did it take you so long to see me?

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
I've been confined for many days.

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
Nobody treats me as their master now.

133
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,900
The Queen has married far away into Xiqi.

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,360
I've been occupied with
matters to attend to.

135
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,600
I meant to ask you to assist me,

136
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
but...

137
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,600
I planned to make a scene

138
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
on the departure day

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,560
and refused to go to Xiqi
even if I killed myself

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
to make it difficult for Feng Li.

141
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,400
But she confined me.

142
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm not allowed to

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
leave my palace.

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,000
She still has the nerve to
go for the political marriage herself.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
She is the dignified Queen of Mocheng.

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
But she brought such shame upon herself.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,600
She is truly unworthy of
being a member of the Feng family.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,460
Li has wandered since childhood.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
Life has never been easy for her.

150
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
When survival is at stake,

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
who will care about dignity?

152
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,570
She may have no shame

153
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,920
but Mocheng does,

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,460
and so do we,
descendants of the Feng family!

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
Aunt.

156
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
Be good, Ling'er.

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,480
Now that Feng Li is gone,

158
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,200
I will take care of you.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
We are members of the royal clan.

160
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
As long as she is the Queen,

161
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
I am inferior to her.

162
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
Aunt.

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,680
If you don't want to be a bird in a cage,

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
you might as well take a chance.

165
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
The half Tiger Tally your mother left you

166
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,480
before she died

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,210
can command the palace guards.

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,840
With the Tiger Tally,

169
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,280
you can break the deadlock.

170
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
The Tiger Tally

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,960
was taken by Feng Li before she left.

172
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
What a pity.

173
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
I thought you were

174
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
a clever person.

175
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,560
Aunt.

176
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,360
I came to see you before I leave.

177
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
This might be the last time

178
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,740
we sisters see each other.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,960
Your Majesty, you are sending me away
for a political marriage.

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
So, no one will be
in your way anymore, right?

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,720
I didn't come for small talk.

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,170
I want you to give me something important,

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
your mother's Tiger Tally.

184
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
I knew it.

185
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,680
You didn't come with good intentions.

186
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,540
So, you're after the Tiger Tally.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
My mother was the former Guardian General.

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,370
By tradition, both the Tiger Tally

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,130
and the general's position

190
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
should be passed to me.

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,000
You refused to grant me a title

192
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,050
and are sending me far away to Xiqi.

193
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Isn't it just to

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,560
eliminate me as a threat?

195
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
So, you know your mother was the

196
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
Guardian General, hugh?

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,480
You’re nothing but a spoiled fool!

198
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,640
How can you be a daughter of our family?

199
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
How dare you have the nerve
to criticize me?

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Do you think you’re any better?

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Everyone in Mocheng

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,200
knows that you are indulging in
luxury and pleasure,

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
and living in complete debauchery.

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,920
Everyone calls you "Demon Lord"
behind your back.

205
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,320
If Aunt hadn't taken you in

206
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,360
and managed everything for you,

207
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,090
would you even be alive now?

208
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,520
How dare you hit me?

209
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
Yes.

210
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,000
Wake up!

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
Use your brain

212
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,080
and think carefully.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,930
I had been exiled for so many years.

214
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
I couldn't even pay respects to my mom

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,540
on her death anniversary.

216
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,120
What real power do I have?

217
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,840
Think about who it is

218
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,480
that refuses to grant you a title.

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
Why does Xiqi want
a marriage alliance now?

220
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,040
The one who fears you

221
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,200
and wants to send you away

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
is your dear Aunt.

223
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,480
Impossible!

224
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,280
Aunt loves me the most.

225
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,880
It can't be.

226
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,840
Ling'er.

227
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
You are kind-hearted and innocent.

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,210
After so many years by her side,

229
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,440
of course you won't believe me

230
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
when I tell you these things.

231
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
Let's make a bet.

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you dare?

233
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,120
What trick are you plotting now?

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,960
This bet concerns

235
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
Mocheng and its future.

236
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,600
You just want to take

237
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,640
my Tiger Tally

238
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,200
and send me far away to Xiqi.

239
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Why bother lying?

240
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,920
I know very well what's going on.

241
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,810
The marriage alliance is real.

242
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
Someone will go to Xiqi.

243
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,500
But you're not the one.

244
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Then, who else?

245
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
Me.

246
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Hide the Tiger Tally.

247
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,980
Meng Wu will come to ask you for it.

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
You can tell her

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
that I took it.

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,730
If she still treats you
the same as before,

251
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,360
then I lose.

252
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,360
What if I win?

253
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,960
If you win,

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
with the Tiger Tally in hand,

255
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,640
you can overthrow me

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,220
and take my place anytime.

257
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,960
She's mad.

258
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,100
She's asking me to rebel against her?

259
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
Now that the Queen is absent,

260
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,440
with the Phoenix Seal in my possession,

261
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,520
I am in charge of governing Mocheng.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,880
If you have the Tiger Tally
but refuse to hand it over,

263
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
that would be defying orders.

264
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
I...

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,980
Everything I said is true.

266
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,080
Before Feng Li left,

267
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
she took the Tiger Tally.

268
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,520
Aunt, look,

269
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,320
she left my palace in chaos.

270
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Ling'er.

271
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,880
You're merely
an insignificant clan daughter.

272
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,720
Even with the Tiger Tally,
what could you possibly do?

273
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,280
The Tiger Tally

274
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,690
is nothing
but a pile of scrap metal to you.

275
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
It's not scrap.

276
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,000
It's proof of
my mother's military achievements.

277
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
You are really like your mother,

278
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,290
strong-willed and fierce.

279
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,840
However,

280
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
she's dead.

281
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,840
If you fail to choose wisely,

282
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,040
I'll kill you.

283
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,360
You...

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,240
Even if you kill me,

285
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,800
I can't make it appear out of nowhere.

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,680
Aunt.

287
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,680
Aunt.

288
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,760
You know I rely on you the most.

289
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,800
How could you say such hurtful words?

290
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,210
If I really had the Tiger Tally,

291
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,320
wouldn't I have used it

292
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,480
to deal with Feng Li?

293
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,160
In that case,

294
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
your confinement

295
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
will remain.

296
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
Stay in your mansion.

297
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,360
Feng Li was right after all.

298
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,640
What should I do now?
