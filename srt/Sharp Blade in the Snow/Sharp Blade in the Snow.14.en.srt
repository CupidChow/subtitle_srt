[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,070
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Stop right there.

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,289
What happened to your hand?

5
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,780
I was careless just now

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,880
and hit it on the stone steps.

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,320
You're a grown man now

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
yet still so reckless.

9
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,640
You can't even walk properly.

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,520
How could you possibly
serve as the Imperial Consort?

11
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,580
You're so timid in front of the Queen,

12
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,940
afraid to even touch her fingertips.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,680
How will you ever please her?

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
If this continues,

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
sooner or later those male concubines

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
will walk all over you.

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,850
Enough, Mother!

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
What more do you want me to do?

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,960
Do you want me to be like

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,840
Xiao Ze,

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
flaunting myself all day

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,700
with seductive behavior?

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Isn't my current state

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
miserable enough?

25
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,759
How much more
do you want me to debase myself?

26
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,560
You...

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,360
Rest well.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,040
Keep the wound dry

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,620
to avoid scarring.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
I am an envoy from Xiqi.

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,840
Xiqi has been gaining momentum lately.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,480
You've already conquered two cities.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,880
Envoy, what brings you

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,570
to Mocheng so suddenly?

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
Your Majesty, you're still young

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
and may not be aware.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Prime Minister Bai should still remember

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,420
the agreement between Xiqi and Mocheng
from years ago.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,040
I just had a few words
of argument with her

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,640
and now she really wants
to marry me off to Xiqi.

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,680
I've heard that the young master of Xiqi

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,960
has worn a mask
since childhood due to illness.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
No one has ever seen his face.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
He must be ugly.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,920
This isn't just a political marriage.

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,160
This is clearly asking for my life.

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Aunt.

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,080
I've heard that the personality
of the young master of Xiqi

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,040
is even more terrifying.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
To establish military authority,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,320
he often punishes people
for minor offenses

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,850
by cutting off their limbs.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Now I'm confined to the mansion,

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,560
while Li holds all the power.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,560
Even if I want to help you refuse,

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
she won't listen to me.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Aunt.

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,600
Could it be that I truly have no choice

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
but to be manipulated by her?

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
In a few days,

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
the Xiqi delegation will arrive,

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,840
and there will be no turning back.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
Li's position

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
is not yet secure.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
The marriage alliance

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
is for border stability.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,960
The young master of Xiqi
is a brilliant talent

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
who has never lost a battle.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,480
In recent years, he has achieved
numerous military victories

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
and has already become Mocheng's

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,360
greatest threat.

73
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,960
You must not lose your manners

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
or do anything outrageous.

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
A failed marriage alliance
is the least of our concerns.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
If it gives them an excuse to march on us,

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,530
that's where the real trouble begins.

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,840
I will certainly behave well

79
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,000
and make my dear sister

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
proud.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,640
Good child.

82
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,680
Feng Li,

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,370
if you're heartless,
don't blame me for being ruthless.

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,840
My wedding day

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
will be the day of your death.

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,760
You've delivered yourself right to me.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,320
You just started serving that girl

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,250
and now you dare to come for my life.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,040
Slicing you into a thousand pieces
would not be too cruel.

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,160
I want to see

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,800
how she'll save you this time.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,730
For Her Majesty,

93
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
I am willing to do anything.

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
When we get to my palace,

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,040
you'd better still be

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,330
as defiant as you are now.

97
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,190
[Fengling Hall]

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Look,

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,020
what nice little tool is this?

100
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
Tell me,

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
which finger should I

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
start with?

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,920
Today,

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,360
I will tear you, the star

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
from Feng Li's heart.

106
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you done with this nonsense?

107
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,520
He openly attempted to assassinate me.

109
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,320
For such a deranged person,

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,600
why shouldn't I impose punishment?

111
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,360
You claim he attempted assassination,

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
but do you have evidence?

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,520
I am the evidence.

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
I did not.

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,040
I merely

116
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,920
met Princess Ling in the corridor.

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,600
I only

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,450
spoke well of Your Majesty.

119
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
She became angry from embarrassment

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,160
and then had me brought here.

121
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
What?

122
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,120
You just insisted

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
that you came to kill me because of her.

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Nonsense!

125
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,960
If I wanted to kill you,

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,020
why would I need someone else to do it?

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
Everyone here today witnessed

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
that you kidnapped my man,

129
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,420
tortured him recklessly,

130
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
and by law should be executed.

131
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
Considering you'll be sent to Xiqi
for a political marriage in a few days,

132
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll spare you this time.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
If I hear more

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,159
of your gossiping rumors again,

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,920
that mouth of yours

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
won't be needed anymore!

137
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
From today on,

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
you are confined here,

139
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
and no one may enter or leave.

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,160
Violators will be executed.

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
Feng Li!

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Your Majesty.

144
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Your Majesty.

145
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Your Majesty!

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,970
Why is it you?

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Where is Her Majesty?

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,930
Don't tell me

149
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,620
you expect Her Majesty

150
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
to serve you herself.

151
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,850
Who do you think you are?

152
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,840
How dare you treat me
with such disrespect?

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
Let me tell you,

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm now Her Majesty's favorite person.

155
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
Your Majesty.

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
Her Majesty ordered me to serve you,

157
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800
her precious slave.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
It depends on your performance.

159
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
If you serve me well,

160
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
I'll naturally put in

161
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
a good word for you with Her Majesty.

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,320
What are you standing there for?

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,400
Get me some water.

164
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,460
Are you trying to let me die of thirst?

165
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,520
Where's my water?

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
How dare you! What are you doing?

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
I'll report this to Her Majesty!

168
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
So thirsty?

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,320
Right.

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,280
Her Majesty specifically instructed me

171
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
to take good care of you.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,640
So I'll

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,640
feed you the water myself.

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
You...

175
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
No!

176
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,640
Help!

177
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,280
Let me go!

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,880
Today's tribute tea has pine fragrance.

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,010
Would you like to try it, Your Majesty?

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,090
What happened to your hand?

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,040
The other day,

182
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,250
I wanted to carve
a jade seal for Your Majesty myself.

183
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
The carving knife was sharp.

184
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I was careless and cut myself.

185
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Does it hurt?

186
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,290
It doesn't hurt.

187
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
It's already healed.

188
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
You're always like this.

189
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,000
You get injured

190
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,780
and never tell me about it.

191
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
That day,

192
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,400
I was a bit harsh with you.

193
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,050
Are you still upset with me?

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
How could I be upset with you?

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
I was overly concerned.

196
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,490
There must be some special reason.

197
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,160
I should have trusted
Your Majesty's resolve.

198
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,580
You're always so understanding.

199
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,170
Actually, he resembles
someone from my past.

200
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Is...

201
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
Is he the boy you once mentioned

202
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,560
who was with you in the wasteland

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,360
and survived together with you?

204
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Yes.

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Fate is full of irony.

206
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,500
I never expected to meet
him again in the palace.

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,370
Then, Your Majesty,

208
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,370
how do you plan
to arrange for this old friend?

209
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,240
I'll have to think about it carefully.

210
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,140
Your Highness.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,730
This is by order
of the Princess Royal of Mocheng.

212
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
This medicine

213
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,920
should be delivered
to the Demon Lord by me.

214
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,700
Your Highness!

215
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,740
Your Highness.

216
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,410
Something's wrong.

217
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,040
Your Highness's pulse doesn’t feel right.

218
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
No wonder the Queen of Mocheng
takes daily tonics

219
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
laced with poison,

220
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,760
yet shows no signs of poisoning.

221
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,620
So those tonics

222
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,080
were all taken by Your Highness.

223
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
This poison specifically targets the heart

224
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
and is nearly impossible to counter.

225
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,980
Your Highness, why would you do this?

226
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
I have my own plans.

227
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,890
You need not concern yourself.

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Feng Li's life

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,920
is mine alone to take.

230
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,220
Your Highness!

231
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,530
There's been a change of plans.

232
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,620
Starting tonight,

233
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,480
you will enter the palace
as a court lady

234
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,040
and seize the opportunity
to assassinate the Queen of Mocheng.

235
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,760
Be quick.

236
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes.

237
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,780
It's late at night with heavy dew.

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,760
Court lady,

239
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
where are you going to serve now?

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
I am a court lady in the palace

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
of the newly appointed Queen.

242
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm on my way
to serve the Queen at Fengxi Palace.

243
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,880
Wandering around

244
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,560
is against the rules.

245
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Fengxi Palace?

246
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
Fengxi Palace is not exactly
a place of good fortune.

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,240
I advise you

248
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
not to set foot in that place.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,890
I came here on orders

250
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,680
and have no intention
of giving up halfway.

251
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,960
Ruo!

252
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,880
Your Highness has good eyes.

253
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
Among General Lu's subordinates,

254
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,050
you're the only one who can match me

255
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
for a few moves, Ruo.

256
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,060
Unfortunately, Your Highness is unwell

257
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
and may not be my match.

258
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,090
The Xiqi delegation arrives in 3 days.

259
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
Once the marriage alliance is formed,

260
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
Dongli will have little chance
to restore its kingdom.

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,000
I came here

262
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,760
to assist Your Highness

263
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,340
in killing the Demon Lord of Mocheng.

264
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,520
Feng Li's life

265
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
is mine alone to take.

266
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
When and how to kill her

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,130
is not for any of you to interfere with.

268
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,580
Your Highness,

269
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,260
you can barely control your own life,

270
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,560
how can you control others'?

271
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,180
If you still acknowledge me as your lord,

272
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,640
get out now.

273
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,880
This Yun Zhan

274
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,640
is truly despicable.
