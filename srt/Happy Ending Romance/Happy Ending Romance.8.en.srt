166
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,170
Jung Hyun,

167
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,030
a writer of three-consecutive bestsellers was actually a ghostwriter.

168
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,150
On top of that, it was Cha Jung Woo who was kicked out of Literature Square.

169
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:32,700
When this is revealed, you think anyone here will benefit at least 1% from this?

170
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,190
- Let's bury it.
- Professor.

171
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,030
Doing this won't improve the situation that's enveloping us.

172
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,980
Let's just cover it up.

173
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,330
Everyone can become happy if we just cover it up.

174
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,090
I think that's how we ended up at this point.

175
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,390
Even if it hurt... even if we were miserable,

176
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,810
even if we felt like dying, if we had just endured a bit,

177
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,320
things would've been different than they are now.

178
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,910
Please help Jung Woo make a comeback, Professor.

179
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,950
Then convince Cha Jung Woo to publish his book here.

180
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,330
From Literature Square.

181
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,110
- That's-
- I know.

182
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,780
That Jung Woo hates this place for whatever reason.

183
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,730
But is there any reason for me to help when it doesn't benefit me in any way?

184
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,280
I believe he has already entered a contract with another publishing company.

185
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,680
Tell him to break it.

186
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,500
Tell him we'll pay for the breach of contract fee.

187
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,040
How about it?

188
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,880
Will I not suffice?

189
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,260
You're the one who confessed that you're just an empty shell.

190
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,310
Do you expect me to be convinced after hearing that?

191
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,470
Asking Jung Woo to become editor in the first place was

192
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,810
because I didn't want Jung Woo's talent to go to waste.

193
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,740
And when the opportunity came, I was going to publish a book for him.

194
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,930
That was my original plan.

195
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,930
We can just think it's happening a bit earlier. What's the problem?

196
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,770
It's good for Jung Woo if a big-scale publishing company has his back.

197
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,240
Jung Woo probably won't budge.

198
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,580
- If you could convince the literary world-
- What do you think...

199
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,850
will happen to you two if I report this?

200
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,310
Before you make a confession.

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,930
I'm sorry!

202
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,230
I ended up eavesdropping inadvertently, Director.

203
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,200
And I'm going to stick my nose in inadvertently.

204
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,130
I'm the CEO of Yi Rang Publishing Company, Han Tae Young.

205
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,580
I'm sorry, but I have something to discuss with Writer Kim.

206
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,450
Would you be willing to listen to me if I speak as the CEO of the publishing company

207
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,050
in contract with Writer Cha Jung Woo?

208
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,560
What are you so deep in thought about?

209
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm just wondering why we're going to such lengths over something insignificant.

210
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,120
Huh?

211
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,610
In the end, it was nothing.

212
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,030
I should've just lived the way I wanted to.

213
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,790
It's nothing significant,

214
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,490
so I think living each day to the fullest is the best we can do.

215
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,660
What I want to do,

216
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,370
who I want to see,

217
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,270
what I want to eat and drink,

218
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,690
and living a life doing what I want to do.

219
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,320
"I'll just do my best to play with you for today."

220
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,070
Living with that kind of resolution isn't that bad.

221
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,450
Sunbae, you're really different from me.

222
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,870
I lived in anxiety and worry over what tomorrow would bring.

223
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,190
I was like that, too.

224
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,910
Sorry?

225
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,820
Before I met you and went under.

226
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,750
But once I went under, that's when I realized.

227
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,780
If things were going to end up like this, all my worries were in vain.

228
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,120
So Jung Woo, you'll end up doing great.

229
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,920
Thanks, Sunbae.

230
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,140
Well.

231
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
Cha Jung Woo,

232
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,060
even if I have to beg,

233
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,560
I'll try to convince the literary world.

234
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,940
Let's work well together going forward.

235
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,530
Come on, what are you waiting for?

236
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,180
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

237
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I had no idea you'd move Yoon Chi Hyung.

238
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,760
As expected, Kim Jung Hyun is Kim Jung Hyun.

239
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,500
Thanks, Hyung.

240
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,850
Kang Woo Joo.

241
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,180
Yes, Sunbaenim.

242
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,130
What's with this atmosphere?

243
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,560
We should be overjoyed,

244
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,270
but why does the joy feel forced?

245
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,340
Well... it's not my place to tell you.

246
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,560
Jung Woo,

247
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,300
let's talk for a moment.

248
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,710
I'll tell him, Writer Kim.

249
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,350
Please let me tell him.

250
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,790
Shall we step out?

251
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,390
What ridiculous nonsense is that?

252
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you mean go to Literature Square instead of working with you?

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,860
Please do me this favor and do as I ask.

254
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,840
You said you wanted to publish a book with me.

255
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,530
But telling me to go to Literature Square instead of Yi Rang Publishing Company?

256
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,890
Well...

257
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,020
Well, that was Professor Yoon Chi Hyung's condition,

258
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,090
but I want you to go somewhere bigger

259
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,570
and shake off all your sorrows.

260
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,550
Am I a beggar?

261
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,600
Am I a charity case?

262
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,650
Did you think that would help me?

263
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,260
Actually, why would you decide what's good for me in the first place?

264
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,350
So what you want is for me to publish a book at a bigger company?

265
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,950
Fine, let's say I join them.

266
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,640
Then what about you?

267
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,160
If I go elsewhere and write and publish a book, would you be happy?

268
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,240
Is that it?

269
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,020
Writer Cha...

270
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,750
By chance...

271
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,350
are you afraid I'll drag you under...

272
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,360
Is that why you sent me to Literature Square?

273
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,860
Is it like that?

274
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,190
I only now realized...

275
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,100
Now...

276
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,380
Because of you, Tae Young...

277
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,240
Because of you...

278
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,620
Han Tae Young, because of you!
