51

There's someone who's happy because of my words.

what I'm doing right now.

65
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,560
In times like that, don't think about anything.

Yes.

then just look ahead.

105

Isn't it more absurd for you to be doing the edits instead of stopping Jeong Wu?

106
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,290
You just need to get paid for your work, regardless of whether the book succeeds or fails,

He finished working on his next work at Wonju lately.

162
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,190
I got a meeting scheduled.

163
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,370
How about Kim Jeong Hyeon?

164
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,110
There's a person named Park Gong, who writes on SNS.

165
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,160
He's got quite some followers.

166
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,050
If we organize it well, we can make it into a book.

167
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,050
Sentimental essays are good, aren't they?

168
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,710
- Sentimental essays are good. 
 - Right?

169
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,330
So I sent a DM, and he says he'd love to.

170
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,660
He wants to set up a meeting.

171
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,100
So what about Kim Jeong Hyeon?

172
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,360
Lee Jong Won and sentimental essays are all fine.

173
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,750
But what about Kim Jeong Hyeon?

174
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,770
Kim Jeong Hyeon!

175
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,500
Publishing alumni Kim Jeong Hyeon and Cha Jeong Wu's collected short stories...

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,570
let's not do it.

177
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,100
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,210
Kang Wu Ju!

179
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,520
What's wrong with you, man?

180
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Move.

181
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,270
If you're angry, let's talk about it, please.

182
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,990
You're still a CEO even if you get a salary, aren't you?

183
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,950
This is a very irresponsible attitude.

184
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,600
Responsibility?

185
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,380
Do you dare to discuss responsibility?

186
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,330
Hey, shall we break it down from one to ten...

187
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,500
- who's more irresponsible? 
 - Kang Wu Ju...

188
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,980
If you'll think and decide by yourself... then don't pay me. Save it!

189
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,820
Pay the rent or the tax with it.

190
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,010
I can't do this because I get too stressed out.

191
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,490
Where are you going?

192
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,790
Hey, don't you know who Kim Jeong Hyeon is?

193
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,780
It's Kim Jeong Hyeon. The Kim Jeong Hyeon!

194
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,700
His work from two years ago is being turned into a movie.

195
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,560
Do you think his influence in the literary world will stop then?

196
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,770
See? You don't even do this much calculation.

197
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,310
If you spent just a tenth of the effort you put into Cha Jeong Wu...

198
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,720
then I wouldn't even complain.

199
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,400
This is a business.

200
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,960
It's a business that you and I are running together.

201
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,340
Had I known that things would turn out like this because of Cha Jeong Wu,

202
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,050
I would never have dreamt about doing business with you in the first place.

203
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,390
Do you understand?

204
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,860
Be considerate of me, please.

205
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,690
Tae Yeong, I'm saying be considerate of me.

206
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,140
Think about this. Am I just a bystander?

207
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,680
Do I need to watch you go bankrupt and console you over a drink when this place shuts down?

208
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,330
You know it, Wu Ju.

209
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,930
It's my lifelong wish to edit and publish what Cha Jeong Wu writes.

210
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,700
That is the only thing that has kept me going so far.

211
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,520
I feel like I won the lottery right now.

212
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,970
You're here just in time.

213
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,000
Seonbaenim, what brings you here?

214
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,090
We're very small, aren't we?

215
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,110
I heard your work from two years ago will be made into a movie.

216
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,170
You must be very busy.

217
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm not sure if this will be to your liking.

218
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,460
I'd like to talk to CEO Han here privately.

219
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,090
Sure.

220
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,490
Sure thing.

221
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,530
Then you two can go ahead and have a talk.

222
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,560
Please say what you need to say.

223
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,000
Seonbae, if you don't have time, we can talk about it next time.

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,300
I need to go to my part-time job now.

225
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,100
H-Huh?

226
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,550
Only one place agreed to publish a book in your name.

227
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,650
I see.

228
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,230
But even that hasn't been confirmed yet.

229
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,410
It's a place where my hubae is the CEO, but it's really small.

230
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,990
I think it might be possible because it's a small place.

231
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,470
Then we can just go with that place.

232
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,620
The other Co-CEO is the one in charge,

233
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,820
but I guess we'll know once we meet them.

234
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,470
What do you think about meeting them together?

235
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,630
I'd love to.

236
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,940
Also, if it just doesn't work out...

237
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,500
It's fine if it doesn't work out.

238
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,690
It's fine?

239
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,560
That's not like Cha Jeong Wu.

240
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,440
If it doesn't work out, I'll think about it then.

241
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,570
I'm going to live a little more simply.

242
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,180
I came to warn you.

243
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,550
Warn me?

244
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,740
If you publish a book in Jeong Wu's name, there will be casualties.

245
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,590
It doesn't matter.

246
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,640
As you can see, we can be here and gone tomorrow.

247
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,920
I don't mean you, but Jeong Wu.

248
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,590
I'm saying Jeong Wu will be very hurt.

249
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,850
I came because I wanted to let you know that you'll be

250
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,740
picking at his wound from the past, which is just healing.

251
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,060
Is that why you're doing this?

252
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,700
Telling me, "Don't publish the book."

253
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,850
And to Cha Jeong Wu, "Don't write."

254
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,650
Did you know this, Writer Kim?

255
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,980
Right now, you look like someone who lost something.

256
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,170
Who could guarantee that

257
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,550
the same thing is going to happen again just because it happened once?

258
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,710
Even if that person is Writer Kim Jeong Hyeon...

259
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,260
I can't trust it.

260
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,660
Also, with Writer Cha Jeong Wu...

261
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,130
I think it's more than valuable enough.

262
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,860
That's right.

263
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,710
I did lose something.

264
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,860
I'll have to get back what I lost.

265
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,860
I don't think I can find it for you.

266
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,420
I think it's about time for you to leave.

267
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,350
I should get to work.

268
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,130
♫ <i>I still</i> ♫

269
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,250
♫ <i>Will always be the one</i> ♫

270
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,900
He better not ruin this lucky chance that came to us on its own.

271
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,790
Seonbaenim, are you leaving already?

272
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,560
♫ <i>I still, I still remain in your heart</i> ♫

273
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:06,370
♫ <i>Like an unchanging tree, I'll still be with you</i> ♫

274
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,460
Hello?

275
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,830
Yes, I'm Kang Wu Ju.

276
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,860
Literature Square?

277
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,910
<i>[Literature Square]</i>

278
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,510
<i>Go for your dream you haven't fulfilled yet at Literature Square.</i>

279
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,460
<i>How about it? Will you be working with us?</i>

280
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,920
<i>[Literature Square]</i>

281
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,050
<i>It's a special request from Writer Kim Jeong Hyeon, so</i>

282
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,830
<i>think it through quickly and let me know.</i>

283
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,490
<i>Wow, there's really a lot to do. Seriously.</i>

284
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,550
How much is this now?

285
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,510
There's no money coming in, but there's a lot going out.

286
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,370
It's a loss. A loss.

287
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,350
He must be having a ball.

288
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,140
If he's not coming back, he should call me, text me, or

289
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,590
at least stay in touch—

290
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,370
No.

291
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,800
If he finds out I chased Kim Jeong Hyeon away, he'll freak out for sure.

292
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,500
The publisher CEO is off the clock.

293
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Cha Jeong Wu's assistant is on the clock.

294
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,520
Writer Cha, do you need anything?

295
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
No, nothing.

296
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,980
I'm not being a distraction or anything, right?

297
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,050
If you stare at me like that, it's a bit...

298
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,710
I guess so, right?

299
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,060
Then what about a cup of coffee?

300
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,680
I'd be grateful.

301
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,580
Don't mention it. An assistant should do this at least.

302
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,330
Thank you.

303
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,810
Thank you...

304
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,970
again.

305
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,560
Gosh, you're embarrassing me over just a cup of coffee.

306
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,050
No, I mean for everything.

307
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,540
You can say I realized it after meeting you.

308
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,730
I felt something.

309
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,520
I thought I was the most unfortunate human in the world, but...

310
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,380
perhaps I'm actually the happiest person in the world.

311
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,190
Are you really saying it's because of me?

312
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,330
Yes, Seonbaenim.

313
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,240
It's me, Kang Wu Ju.

314
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,990
Let's all get together.

315
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,870
I'm thankful to Hyeong Jeong Hyeon.

316
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,200
And I feel bad for him as well.

317
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,330
How does the talk suddenly go there?

318
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,840
I wanted to tell you about Hyeong Jeong Hyeon.

319
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,770
He was busy trying to cover up my misfortune.

320
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,210
He was worried that my misfortune would stick out

321
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,230
or outside people would point fingers at me...

322
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,920
He did his best to hide me from it all, however...

323
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,510
However?

324
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,630
However, you were different.

325
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,960
You overlaid my misfortune with new happiness.

326
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,810
"Try pointing fingers if you want to!" Like this.

327
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,460
You gave me new happiness.

328
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,910
- Thank you, seriously. 
 - Oh, seriously.

329
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,810
Please stop, really.

330
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm actually the one

331
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,480
who's really thankful because you appeared before me, Writer Cha.

332
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,930
Really?

333
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,380
Yes.

334
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,790
The more I wrote,

335
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,060
my flaws kept showing up, and I was tormented.

336
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,010
I read your work. A writer who's about the same age as me.

337
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,640
Then I was assured.

338
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,590
- Assured? 
 - Yes.

339
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,240
"Seriously... I guess I'm not cut out for this."

340
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,620
"I'm hopeless."

341
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,930
"I'd be doomed if I were a novelist."

342
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,150
Back then, I thought, "I'll work with the person who wrote this for sure

343
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,660
and I'll make sure to become partners."

344
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,410
Tae Yeong, you need to promise me here.

345
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,300
Sure, anything.

346
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,990
Please just be my assistant this time around.

347
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,780
- Wh-What does that mean? 
 - Only this time around.

348
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,400
If things work out well this time,

349
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,960
I'll print my next work at your company.

350
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,910
It's because publishing a book with my name on it could be bad for you, Tae Yeong.

351
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,780
I told you many times that I don't care about that—

352
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,080
I promised to work with someone already.

353
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,490
Someone I promised before you, Tae Yeong.

354
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,810
A person who wouldn't resent me... even if things go under.

355
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,550
I don't know who that person is, but I'm jealous of them.

356
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,960
Gosh, seriously!

357
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,810
You have to work with me next time for sure.

358
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,130
Now, hurry and seal it.

359
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,490
And the signature as well.

360
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,440
Copy.

361
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,520
You have to keep your word.

362
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,560
I got it.

363
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,310
♫ <i>We can't see an inch ahead because of the darkness</i> ♫

364
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,820
♫ <i>We lost our way, and we're wandering</i> ♫

365
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,300
Yes, Professor.

366
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,680
Yes, I understand.

367
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,640
Okay.

368
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:12,160
♫ <i>A deep nightmare you can't awaken from</i> ♫

♫ <i>I'll protect you</i> ♫

376
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,520
Lie down and sleep, Tae Yeong.

377
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,700
No, it's okay.

378
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,360
You're not sleeping, either, Writer Cha.

379
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,740
Then I guess I'll have to just sleep because of you.

380
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,800
We can't have that.

381
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,780
Then I'll lie down here and go to sleep while watching you work.

382
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,700
- Sure, you do that, then. 
 - Okay.

383
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,400
There you go.

384
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,260
Can't we stay like this until I fall asleep?

385
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,670
Gosh, I love this.

386
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,120
Hey, how can you come in now? I said we don't have time.

387
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,070
What's this about all of a sudden? I just got to work.

388
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,560
I explained it to you over the phone.

389
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
It's a present I'm giving you.

390
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,340
So what is that present?

391
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,760
You need to explain for me to understand.

392
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,690
It's a present a friend is giving to another.

393
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,190
We don't have time. Let's hurry.

394
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,060
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go. 
 - Okay, okay.

395
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,940
- Hurry! 
 - Okay.

396
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,340
Jeong Hyeon...

397
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,900
I did everything you asked me to do.

398
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,640
You don't need anything else, right?

399
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,280
Now, it's time for you to keep your promise.

400
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,440
- Let's sign the contract. 
 - Okay.

401
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,820
By the way...

402
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,160
What do you mean, "by the way"?

403
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,820
You promised to trample a place named

404
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,360
Lee Rang Publishing Company for sure, but that's still...

405
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,100
I looked into that place and

406
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,750
they were on the verge of shutting down because they didn't have money.

407
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,210
They'll be gone on their own.

408
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,900
Even if they're not gone, the moment they publish a book with Cha Jeong Wu's name,

409
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,070
do you think they could even distribute it?

410
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,780
It's actually for the better.

411
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,890
If Cha Jeong Wu gets disheartened one more time,

412
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:54,760
I'll take him to Seonbae Jang Su Cheol, make him kneel down and apologize.

413
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,840
Then Seonbae Jang will also... accept Jeong Wu like before.

414
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,310
If you send me the contract to my email, I'll review it and sign it.

415
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,970
I'll tell them to send it to you right away.

416
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,520
Seonbae!

417
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,800
- Yes. You're here. 
 - I'm sorry for being late.

418
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,940
It's fine. These fellows are not here yet, either.

419
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,060
It's confirmed that they'll publish it, right?

420
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,040
Yes. After we meet each other today, you just need to focus on writing.

421
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,470
Okay.

422
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,320
Oh, they're coming.

423
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,610
Then the writer we're signing the contract with is...

424
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,500
The publishing company is...

425
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,580
<i>Timing and Subtitles are brought to you by the 💙 Happy Ending 💙 Team @Viki.com</i>

<i>I'll be in your care then.</i>

428
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,760
<i>So you're telling me...</i>

429
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,580
<i>to betray and abandon Jeong Wu?</i>

432
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,850

433
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,630

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,310
<i>I'm asking why you did that!</i>

438
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,200
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

439
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,410
<i>Why did you leave me after agreeing to work together?</i>

440
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,450
<i>I realized it through that guy...</i>

441
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,350
<i>that I was covering my misfortune with your misfortune.</i>

442

<i>casting me aside.</i>
