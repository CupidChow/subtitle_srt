I have a feeling everything will work out.

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,160
- Right? 
 - Yes.

4

- CEO Han. 
 - Sure!

Thank you, Sunbaenim.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,370
Or should I call you Editor?

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,030
Well, whatever's more comfortable for you.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,280
Whether it's Sunbae or Editor.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,290
Our goal is to help Writer Cha Jeong Wu and create a good book anyway.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,470
All right! I look forward to working with you, Sunbaenim.

12

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,790
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,360
Oh, no, what should I do? I have plans.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,530
- Oh, then the three of us will just— 
 - Sorry...

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,390
I also have to stop by somewhere.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,460
I'm sorry, Writer Cha.

19

You can go with CEO Han today, and I'll see you next time.

20

If you're going out of your way because of me, I can just go next time.

No, it's okay. It's okay.

Since we're already on the subject, let's go together.

23

I don't have anything to do anyway.

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,510
The space is a bit small, huh?

25

or you'll work with me next time, is it?

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,430
You might go under if you work with me.

In my eyes, you're brilliant.

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,670
And I actually think it's for the better

67
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,630
that no one could recognize a brilliant writer like you yet.

68

Let's just go for it!

69

So you should accept it, too.

80
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,520
This situation and the events that will take place from now on.

81

Then please take good care of me.

82

Please take good care of me, Writer Cha.

84

87
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,890

What are you talking about?

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,470
You should've said all that back then.

91
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,450
You should've discouraged us then like you're doing now.

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,220
Then I wouldn't have wandered around like this all this time.

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,820
But... now you're telling me not to publish a book with Jeong Wu?

94
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,240
Why should I listen to you?

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,880
So... you'll go through with publishing Jeong Wu's writing?

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,340
I have no other choice.

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,880
Or... you could offer me a better deal.

98
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,940
You've changed a lot.

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,680
Am I the weird one for having changed?

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,230
You guys are the weird ones for remaining unchanged.

101
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,340
If this is all you called me here to talk about, then let's stop talking.

Why?

112
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,130
I feel like things are progressing too smoothly.

113

Hey, spit that back out. Spit, spit, spit it out.

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Spit.

115
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,830

After that incident,

123
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,960
did you know Jeong Wu and I are the only ones who became miserable?

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,600
The world was silent as if nothing had happened,

Me?

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,380
Honestly, after Jeong Wu's pen snapped, you made it big.

129
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,740
Not just big, but you flourished.

130
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,500
I must look happy to you, huh?

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,680
Are you envious of the shells that envelop me?

132
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,810
Don't say it like that.

133
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,780
One would think you're miserable.

I wouldn't have joined Literature Square for a million dollars.

Let me ask you, Buddy.

Why are you so intent on preventing Jung Woo from publishing a book?

233

I sincerely want Jung Woo to become happy.

What if that happiness...

237
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,290

In the end, you just don't want Jung Woo to make a comeback!

255

Jung Woo needs to stay cooped away like this, so you can easily deal with him.

Ghostwriting.

Why do you ask?

274
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,730
Not Professor Jang Soo Cheol's ghostwriting incident.

275
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,880
- Then? 
 - The ghostwriting under Writer Kim Jung Hyun's name.

276
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,600
No way.

You said what you want is my misery.

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,860
The day Jung Woo fell apart,

281
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,000
I was resolved to do anything for him.

282
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,890
No matter how great his writing, he couldn't write a book under his name.

283
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,100
So what else could I do with a guy who can't live without writing?

284
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,560
So... since then, you and Jung Woo-

285
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,270
That was the best I could do... for Jung Woo.

286
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,290
Ever since Jung Woo ended up like that,

287
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,960
I thought you borrowed supernatural powers.

288
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,330
Because your writing was too good.

289
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,540
Do you think I was happy?

290
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,750
That hollow glory... popularity...

293
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,220
Go and tell the whole world.

294
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,130
Go to Jang Soo Chul, Yoon Chi Hyung, and the people in the literary world

295
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,100
and tell them all of Kim Jung Hyun's works they've been praising was all Cha Jung Woo's works.

296
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,240
Aren't they embarrassed of themselves?

297
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,750
No, tell them to be embarrassed.

298
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,100
What's your reason for revealing this now?

299
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,920
I told you.

300

All I want is for Jung Woo to be happy.

If we wait just a bit,

Jung Woo can go back out into the world comfortably as I had planned.

I admit that you must not have been happy, either.

Hey, Kang Woo Joo!

327
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,360
I came without even calling.

328
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,550
That's okay, right?

329
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,680
Yes.

330
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,090
Hello.

331
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,720
Please come in.

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,180
There's something...

334
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,120
you should know, too.

339
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,550
You should've gone inside. What are you doing out here?

340
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,810
Let's go in.

341
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,670
Let's go-

342
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,710
Did you do that?

343
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,260
Did you do that?

344
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,500
You'll punch me at this rate.

345
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,480
Why did you do that?

346
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,780
Why did you do that?

347
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,650
And why did you do that?

348
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,460
We agreed to do this together, but why did you leave me?

349
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,600
I realized through that guy...

350
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,020
that your misery was covering my misery.

351
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,260
And it was hard for me.

352
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,330
Relying on you

353
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,120
and being trapped in the past while reminding each other of our misery.

354
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,090
So that's why you're doing something with an obvious result?

355
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,570
Are you stupid?

356
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,160
You should wait until the fire dies out.

357
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,170
But you're insisting on jumping into the fire?

358
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,500
So you're doing this for me?

359
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,560
Is this why you're preventing me from writing a book under my name with your entire being?

360
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,220
It'll be difficult.

361
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,750
It'll hurt,

362
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,740
and you'll be tormented.

363
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,550
It was difficult,

364
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,560
it hurt...

365
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,230
and I was tormented.

366
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,990
I won't run away any longer out of fear of those things.

367
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,240
I'll find my own happiness.

368
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,200
I hope you'll do the same.

<i>Is that why you sent me to Literature Square?</i>
