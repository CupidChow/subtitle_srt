Are you concerned now?

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,840
is trying to do you dirty.

168
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,430
He's despicable.

169
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,240
What do you think?

170
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,810
Isn't this a pretty good item for a company

171
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,430
that's just starting out?

172
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,830
A comeback work by a misfortunate genius writer.

173
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,120
Sunbaenim,

174
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,130
I'm not the sole executive of this company, though.

175
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,790
There's actually another substantive owner.  After I ask-

176
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,480
Think about it.

177
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,730
I make offers, but I don't plead.

178
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,540
Oh, you're leaving already?

179
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,730
I ask that you make a swift decision,

180
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,150
CEO Kang Woo Joo.

181
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,660
No need to address me CEO.

182
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,220
Take care!

183
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,560
I'll call you!

184
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,680
What's the meaning of this?

185
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,230
I'm going to stay elsewhere for a while.

186
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,360
And you have a place to go?

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,160
Did Young Seon tell you to leave? Did she ask you to live together?

188
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,000
Hyung, have you been digging into my affairs?

189
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,830
Or did Young Seon sunbae tell you?

190
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,660
It's nothing like that.

191
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
It's not Young Seon and...

192
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,800
I just found out.

193
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,030
- That's not what's important right now.
- Then what's important?

194
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,810
- You really don't know?
- Yeah, I really don't know!

195
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,470
Hyung,

196
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,520
I didn't exist for the past few years.

197
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,790
Cha Jung Woo was nowhere to be found.

198
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,660
I only trusted you

199
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,620
and only looked to you.

200
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,970
I did everything you asked

201
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,440
and lived the way you wanted me to.

202
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,600
It was the way I wanted you to?

203
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,500
Not the way you wanted to?

204
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,900
You came looking for me,

205
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,860
and you said you wanted to remain within me.

206
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,570
And aren't you the one who said you wanted to write in whatever form possible?

207
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,860
But you're the victim-

208
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,670
And I'm the bad guy who used you?

209
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,020
I thought this when Professor Yoon Chi Hyung came looking for me.

210
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,920
If he tells me to beg on my knees, so be it.

211
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,750
If he asks me to lick his foot, so be it.

212
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,130
If it means I could write under my name.

213
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,960
If it means I could return to my own name!

214
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,290
But...

215
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,760
he told me to do editing.

216
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,800
What's wrong with that?

217
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,940
There are times you need to take a step backward!

218
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,690
Is it right to steal a pen from a writer and replace it with a red one?

219
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,930
Is stealing an instrument from a musician

220
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,320
and telling them to monitor someone else's performance taking a long way?

221
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,210
Isn't that torture?

222
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,700
You know how the market is as well.

223
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,960
- It's still too early, Jung Woo-
- Hyung, how...

224
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,200
How many more years should I wait? Huh?

225
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,100
Until Jang Soo Cheol dies?

226
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,340
Will that day even come?

227
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,950
What did I do so wrong?

228
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,510
What the hell did I do so wrong that everyone's treating me like this?

229
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,110
Young Seon sunbae went under because of me.

230
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,210
And I also know that people who tried to help me got hurt as well.

231
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,610
But...

232
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,470
you're more miserable than I am?

233
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,700
- Are you more unfortunate than I am?
- You waited all this time-

234
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,380
What's wrong with a little more waiting?

235
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,490
And are you the only miserable one?

236
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,390
You think I'm doing all this for me?

237
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,840
Yeah, isn't that it?

238
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,350
Don't you just need a slave who can keep writing under your name?

239
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,070
What, you a**hole?

240
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm sick of printing your name on my work now.

241
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,200
Remaining in your name...

242
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,160
I can't do it any longer.

243
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,590
Should we do that?

244
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,040
Should we do that?

245
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,340
Yeah, let's do that.

246
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,530
Hey,

247
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,360
do what?

248
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,260
What?

249
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,260
S***.

250
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,720
What should we do about Kim Jung Hyun and Cha Jung Woo, CEO Han?

251
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,390
We need to get a hold of them somehow!

252
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,890
If we want to publish a short story collection, at least.

253
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,540
- Writer Kim Jung Hyun...
- That's right.

254
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,280
- A guaranteed box-office hit.
- Sounds good.

255
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,850
- Sounds good, but-
- Cha Jung Woo is Cha Jung Woo...

256
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,800
but can't we just go without Cha Jung Woo?

257
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,550
Honestly, you know what I mean.

258
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,970
Cha Jung Woo was great in the past,

259
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,100
but countless newbies twinkled and disappeared.

260
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,740
With no need to squeeze him in,

261
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,130
- we'll put Kim Jung Hyun on the poster-
- Hey.

262
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,110
Kim Jung Hyun is important, too,

263
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,010
but don't you know Cha Jung Woo is the essential participant?

264
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,680
What's wrong with you? So tacky.

265
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
Tae Young,

266
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,480
I might not have experience, but I have an eye for writing.

267
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,490
That's right.

268
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,660
We just haven't been able to publish anything,

269
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,550
but is there a book that we haven't done well when we said it would?

270
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,230
There weren't any.

271
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,890
- There weren't.
- But why...

272
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,590
are we so different when it comes to Cha Jung Woo?

273
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,040
If Cha Jung Woo is as uncertain as Kim Jung Hyun,

274
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,240
shouldn't we coax Kim Jung Hyun, who's slightly more certain?

275
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,920
Hey, what's so uncertain about Cha Jung Woo?

276
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,250
- He said he'll write.
- That's why we should-

277
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,340
Cha Jung Woo said he'll write?

278
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,800
Yeah.

279
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,720
Did Young Seon sunbae visit you, too?

280
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,540
Young Seon sunbae?

281
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,410
- Who's that?
- Huh?

282
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,370
Oh, so...

283
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,380
there's someone like that.

284
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,870
A-Anyway, how did you convince Cha Jung Woo?

285
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,480
And what about writing? Where will he write?

286
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,440
Are you going to surveil him?

287
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,970
Are you going to install a CCTV and keep an eye on him?

288
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,390
Good thinking.

289
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,720
Of course, I'll surveil him.

290
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm going to surveil him.

291
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,340
You just got to work. Where will you surveil him?

292
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,160
Are you serious?

293
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,690
Where are you going?

294
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,390
My sweet home.

295
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,520
Hey, Cha Jung Woo's at your house?

296
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,600
Writer Cha. Writer Cha!

297
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,800
What are you doing here like this?

298
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,490
I dozed off.

299
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,710
You should've called me or something.

300
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,290
How long were you sitting here like this?

301
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,580
My battery ran out.

302
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,370
Let's go.

303
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,600
Why are your hands so cold?

304
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm fine.

305
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,510
You're not.

306
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,960
You're feverish.

307
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,020
Let's go.

308
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,540
You should've waited inside in this cold weather.

309
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,550
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

310
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,670
Okay, look.

311
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,230
One, zero, two, three.

312
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,570
It's my birthday.

313
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,170
Now you know the passcode, right?

314
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,290
Go inside, and I'll go buy you some medicine.

315
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,860
No, there's no need for you to-

316
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,260
What are you saying?

317
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,130
If you're sick, what use is an assistant?

318
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,980
Come on, go in.

319
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,380
I'll hurry back with the medicine.

320
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,170
You're amusing.

321
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,030
I mean, think about it.

322
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,090
You never came looking for me first in the past few years.

323
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,750
So...

324
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,920
I was wondering if you felt bad toward me like Jung Woo did.

325
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,650
But judging by your expression, I guess not.

326
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,890
So what do you want?

327
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,440
Don't you have something to tell me?

328
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,020
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

329
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,100
About Jung Woo.

330
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,330
Jung Hyun,

331
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,540
do you know why and because of whom my company went under,

332
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,020
and why I'm living as a freelance writer, floating around like a stray dog?

333
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,510
- Are you saying it was my fault?
- No.

334
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,920
It was me.

335
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,460
Whether you asked me for a favor or Jung Woo pleaded with me,

336
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,760
it was ultimately my decision.

337
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,800
Even now.

338
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,880
Jung Woo did come looking for me,

339
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,460
but I think Jung Woo's skill is wasted. Both then and now.

340
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,940
So you're saying you'll continue?

341
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,420
I have nothing to lose now.

342
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,950
Then, of course, it's a go.

343
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,560
If anything goes wrong with Jung Woo...

344
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,900
I won't leave you unscathed.

345
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,990
And if you won't?

346
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,550
You've changed, Kim Young Seon.

347
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,590
Okay.

348
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,910
What is all this?

349
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,240
Oh, I didn't know where exactly you're sick, so...

350
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,330
Let's see.

351
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,300
These are vitamins good for endurance.

352
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,810
Nasal cold medicine,

353
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,570
throat medicine for sore throats,

354
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,500
and I thought you might benefit from fatigue recovery,

355
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,990
so a pick-me-up.

356
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,940
And...

357
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,690
an herbal drink you can drink with cold medicine.

358
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,530
And...

359
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,690
for all the toxins of the past can leave your body,

360
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,820
Yeo Woo tea.

361
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,020
One cold medicine would've sufficed.

362
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,840
One would think I'm dying.

363
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,490
Hey, you didn't even go to the hospital. What if you get worse?

364
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,320
You said your throat hurts, and you have a fever, too.

365
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,210
These days, you might think it is a simple cold

366
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,260
but can turn into pneumonia.

367
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,250
Especially with outbreaks of strange infectious diseases in this day and age.

368
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,100
Infectious diseases?

369
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,840
Here.

370
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,010
But why do you like this so much?

371
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,790
Because it's good for your body.

372
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,060
It's better than plain water.

373
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,080
I think this will remind me of you from now on.

374
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
That's right.

375
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,390
That's why I'm giving it to you.

376
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,800
- Really?
- Yes.

377
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,390
A pretty good strategy, right?

378
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,290
Thank you.

379
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,540
If it were me,

380
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,490
I don't think I'd be able to bring a stranger home,

381
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,330
and welcome them warmly like this.

382
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,340
You're not a stranger to me.

383
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,210
And I'm not just giving it to you.

384
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm repaying you.

385
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,670
I can do this. I can do this.

386
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,560
I can do this.

387
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,300
Han Tae Young, I can do this, too.

388
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,340
I'll get a hold of Kim Jung Hyun, by all means.

389
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,240
Sunbaenim?

390
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,340
Sunbaenim.

391
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,360
So...

392
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,170
I came to tell you something.

393
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,090
But you didn't pick up your phone all day-

394
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,470
Don't you think there's a reason I didn't pick up?

395
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,360
Right, of course.

396
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,080
I was worried!

397
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,580
I thought something could've happened to you.

398
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,910
You think I died or something?

399
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,240
No! Not at all.

400
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,370
- So, what I mean is-
- Hey, 20th Class.

401
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,860
Yes, Sunbaenim.

402
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,910
Say what you want to say.

403
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,850
And I'd like for you to leave.

404
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,570
As a matter of fact,

405
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,900
we've made an innovative plan to make a book with short stories of senior writers,

406
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,230
such as yourself and Cha sunbaenim, and other alums.

407
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,390
Tae Young will be in charge of Cha sunbaenim,

408
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,740
and I've agreed to be in charge of you.

409
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,590
Jung Woo said he'll do it?

410
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,140
Yes.

411
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,250
Well, that's a mystery to me, too,

412
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,110
but seeing as how he's at CEO Han Tae Young's house...

413
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,900
I think he is participating.

You took medicine, so now you should be sleepy.

I'm fine.

420

Writer Cha, listen to your assistant.
