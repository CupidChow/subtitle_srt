00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,880
However, the violence outside…

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,800
-will always find its way to places…
-[girl screams]

Why are you always slacking off, huh?

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
Finish your work right now.

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
I have other things to do, got it?

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,000
That sounds like a "you" problem,
not mine.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
Wait.

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,600
If you hit me with that,

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,640
I will report you to the PTA.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,960
I'll tell them what you did.

21

[chuckles]
What is this here? Come on.

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,960
Are you scared of the PTA?

24
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,360
If that's how you feel,
we'll just stay here, yeah?

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,600
You won't be the only one
that doesn't get to go home.

26
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
No one goes home.

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
No fair.

28
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,160
It's his problem, not mine.
I can't stay here.

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
I have a student council meeting.

30
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,560
Me too. I have to go home
to edit my YouTube videos

31
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,160
which I upload every Tuesday.

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,040
If you want to leave,
tell Koh to finish his work.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
I wanna go home, too.
My daughter's waiting.

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,120
Koh.

35
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
Koh, just do your work.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,520
If I don't, what are you gonna do?

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Then just give it to me. Come on.

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,080
No way.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,880
He has to do it.

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Koh, do it now.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
Come on. Do it for us.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,440
Fine. I'll do some work for you.

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
I'll do this one for you, Kaew.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,320
I will do this one for you, Duang.

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,840
And I'll answer…

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
this third question for his daughter.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
-Daddy!
-Tang!

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
Well, I don't need to do it for her now.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,320
His daughter is here.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,000
That freakin' kid came in
at the worst time.

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
-Daddy, can I play a game on your phone?
-Here.

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,920
Look at that.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
If she gets to play games here,
I'm not doing shit.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Hey, Koh.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
[panting]
[Boong] Close the door.

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
-[Boong] Just close the door.
-[Koh] What the hell?

59
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
Get out of the way.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
-[both panting]
-What's going on?

61
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,400
What the hell is going on?

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,400
-Close the door.
-Close the door.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
[Sa] Close the door!

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,920
[Tor] What's going on?

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,600
-What happened?
-I don't know.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,760
We heard someone was attacking the school.

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,520
[Suer] They're wearing our uniform
and stabbing people.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
-We ran here to get away.
-[Koh] What?

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,440
That's not true, Suer.

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,640
Yes, I swear. I saw it with my own eyes.

73
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,400
A kid was stabbed in the throat
over and over, and over.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
I also heard that someone
got their face slashed.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,320
How many of them are there?

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,760
[Boong] I don't know.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,440
Hang on. Just calm down.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
Move the desks over here, hurry!

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
We'll block the door.

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,600
[Tor] Stop.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
Do it quietly.

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,320
Do you want them to hear us, huh?

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,200
Turn off the lights and close the shades.

[clattering]

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.

86
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
Koh! What are you doing?
Grab a desk and help.

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
Everyone, sit over here.

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Keep as quiet as you can
so they don't know where we are, okay?

89
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Do I still need to finish my homework?

90
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
Hey, Koh.

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm just curious.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
He was so serious.

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Stop it, Koh. Can you shut the fuck up?

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,880
The prisoner will hear you
and come and kill us all.

95
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Have you all lost your fucking minds?

96
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,240
You really believe what these two liars
are saying to you?

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
If you don't believe us,
go and see the carnage for yourself.

98
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440

There is an emergency
on the school premises.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,080
A serial killer convicted of eight murders
has escaped from prison

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,800
and is attacking students.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,720
The prisoner is wearing our school uniform

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,520
and has already injured
three of our students.

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,640
I want everyone to remain calm.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,480
And stay in groups
until the next announce--

Are the prisoners gone?

How am I supposed to know that?

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,240
'Cause I saw you using your phone.

114
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm trying to call for help,
but it's not working.

115
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,680
There's no fucking reception
at the school today.

116
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
Can you get through to anyone?

-I can't at all.
-Does it work?

118

[Duang] I can't either.

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,080
I found something…

120
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,880
about the murderer.

121
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,480
What does it say?

122
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,200
The news says,

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
"A typical Friday morning

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,080
has turned into a day of tragedy
at one of our city's

most prestigious private schools.

Law enforcement officials have yet
to release a statement

127
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,240
but sources within the building report
that a young woman,

128
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,640
a recent graduate of the school,
returned with a murderous vendetta.

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
The unidentified female
is said to be walking around

130

smiling and carrying a black bag.

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,160
She has been using a knife
to stab multiple victims

It's still loading on mine.

Hey, hey. Wi sent me a message.

She said the murderer is in building one.

What else did she say?

139
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,040
She said the murderer
is coming to building four.

140

-But that's our building, Dad.
-Quiet. Quiet.

No. Look at it yourself.

to our floor right now.

Damn it.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Anyone whose phone works,
try to text the police to come help us.

-It won't send at all.
-What?

148
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
Can you send a text?

149

-I can't send a text, either.
-No. It won't let me.

What should we do, Daddy? I'm scared.

164
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040
[Tor] She's gone.
She's gone. We're safe now.

165
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,600
[Sa] Are we safe now or not?

166
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,640
I don't know. What are people saying?

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,360
The reception is gone.

168
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,600
Be quiet.

169
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,160
I think I can hear something out there.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,760
Did she come back?

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Shut up, shithead.

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,520
[female student]
Open this door for us, please!

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
-Help! Please!
-[doorknob clanking]

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,680
Hey! Hey! Wait! Don't open it!

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
-What are you doing?
-[Suer] What the hell?

177
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,160
How can we know if she's a student
or the murderer trying to get us

178
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,520
to open the door for them? We don't know.

179
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,440
For our safety, I forbid you
to open the door to anyone.

180
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,240
What if she's not the murderer,
but a student?

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,840
Are you just gonna let her die out there?

182
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
How can we know that?

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
She might come in and kill us all!

184
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
What if she's not?

185
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,160
Will you let her die?
What kind of teacher are you, anyway?

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,120
[scoffs]
I don't know.

187
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm not risking my daughter's life.

188
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,960
You only care about your daughter.
What about the people out there?

189
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
Then I'll let her in!

190
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,400
-[grunts]
-[Tor] I said no!

191
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,640
-I said no.
-Kaew! Open the door now!

192
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
-[both grunt]
-I won't let you!

193
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
[Koh] What? What is wrong with you?

194
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,000
You could have hurt her
pushing her like that!

195
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
I don't care.

196
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,360
If I had to choose
between a student or my daughter,

197
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,800
then I will protect my child.

198
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,120
Doesn't the girl out there
need protecting, too?

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
Shut the fuck up!

200
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,400
-[Suer] Hey, stop.
-[Boong] Stop it!

201
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,560
[panting]

202
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,080
[Nanno] You guys can stop fighting.

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,360
She's dead now.

204
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
[students gasping]

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,520
[all screaming]

206
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
You're the real murderer!

207
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
How am I a murderer?

208
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,760
-Because of you she's dead.
-I helped you guys.

209
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
How did you help us?

210
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
Think about it.

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,680
If we let the girl inside,

212
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
the murderer would've come in, too.

213
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
She would've already murdered all of you.

214
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,480
What I did was sacrifice her

215
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,480
to save all of us.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,880
Don't fucking say that!

217
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,960
Admit it,
you are only thinking about Tang.

218
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
You didn't think about us at all.

219
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
-I did.
-Fucking liar.

220
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
It's obvious that you only care
about your daughter.

221
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
Just you wait.

222
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,360
Once I get out of here,

223
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,600
I will tell everyone how you abandoned
your students out there!

224
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,400
No school will ever hire you.
Not ever again!

225
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Your career will be done.

226
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
-Koh!
-What?

227
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Can you shut up?

228
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,520
If the murderer is still outside,

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
she could still come back to kill us.

230
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
I think it's too late.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,320
She's probably waiting for us
right by the door.

232
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,040
This is all your fault.

233
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,120
Why didn't we run away from the school?

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
Why did you bring us here, anyway?

235
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,520
If you're so smart,
why don't you tell me where to go, huh?

236
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm grateful that we found the others.

237
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
At least we won't die alone.

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
I don't wanna die at all, okay?

239
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
[Kaew] Can you please calm down?

240
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Did you not hear the principal saying
that everything will be fine?

241
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
We don't even know if he's still alive.

242
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
He's probably dead already.

243
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Come on, Koh.

244
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,080
You heard the same thing I heard, right?

245
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,800
He was talking,
then all of a sudden something happened.

246
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,840

248
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,320
[Koh] This teacher is fucking useless.

249
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,880
He is the adult here,

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
but he only cares about himself.

251
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,480
How will a prayer help you now?

252
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,120
Do you think God will come
and lead you both out of here?

253
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
[Tor mumbling]

254
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,840
Let me tell you, the only thing

255
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
God can do at this point

256
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,680
is escort you and your daughter to heaven.

257

[breathing heavily]
You little son of a bitch.

-[Kaew] Calm down! Calm down!

-How could you do that?
-[Kaew] Do you want to die? Fuck you!

261
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,640
You guys can fight all you want!

262
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
Go ahead and kill each other,
you stupid idiots!

Don't you think…

265
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,720
we should find weapons
to protect ourselves?

266
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,560
In case the murderer gets here.

267
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,720
[sighs]

268
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah.

269
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,600
Right. What do we have?

270
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,080
This shit is so useless.

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Shit.

272
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
Hey, Tang, you want this?

273
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,040
[Tor] Koh, I'm warning you.

274

Sir.

275
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
Do you want this?

276
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,000
I saw on the news that a teacher
stabbed some students with a pen.

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,120
I found a pair of scissors. You want them?

[clattering]

279
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
I found a box cutter.

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,520
Who wants it?

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll take that.

282

[cutter clicking]

283
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
Of course, you'll take it…

284
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,480
for yourself.

285
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm the oldest one in the room right now.

286
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,840
I need the sharpest weapon
to protect all of you.

287
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,080
Protect us like you did
that girl out there?

288
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,800
You piece of shit.

289
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
Suer, I found another box cutter.

290
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,320
Here.

291
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,120
You can have this. Okay?

292
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,520
Find anything else?

293
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,880
I found another metal pipe, Koh.

294
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Take it.

295
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

296

[ominous music]

297
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Dad, I'm hungry.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,560
Does anyone have something to eat?

299
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
[Tor] Anyone?

300
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm thirsty, too.

301
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
Does anyone have water?

302
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,440
Just give her some water.

303
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,760
We don't have any.

304
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't lie to me.

305
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,680
I know you've got some.

306
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,160
Give her some water now!

307
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
[Suer] I said we don't have any.

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,800
I saw the look you two gave each other.

309
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Give the kid some water.

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
I said we don't have any.

311
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,760
Then I'll search your bag.

312
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,840
-Give me this.
-[Suer] No. Hey!

[clatters]

[Suer] I told you we don't have any.

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
[Tor] Just wait a little longer.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,240
We'll get some water
when we get out. Okay?

318

[Tor] Everything's gonna be okay.

00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,920
Koh! You drink our water?

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
How's that? You said you didn't have any.

321
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,440
You know, I was saving that
for my girlfriend.

322
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,240
[Koh] What do you mean?

323
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,359
But you said you didn't have any.

324

Are you saying
that you lied to the kid? Really?

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,119
To save water for your girlfriend?

326
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
What kind of man are you?

327
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,200
[burps]

328
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
Do you think they're gone?

329
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,800
[Duang] I don't know.

330
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't hear anything.

331
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,040
I don't either.

332
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,840
If she was still here,

333
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,920
no one would be alive right now.

334
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,520
Actually, I think that

335
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,440
this might be our only chance
to get out of here

336
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
before she comes back.

337
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,760
You go ahead.

338
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Go and find someone to help get us out.

339
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
[Kaew] I agree.

340
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
If you think
this is our only chance to get out,

341
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,480
then you can go.

342
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
Do you expect me to go out there alone?

343
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,200
I meant all of us could go out there
together so we could protect each other.

344
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,320
We're gonna die if we all leave.

345
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
Do you want me to go out there
to die alone?

346
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh, fuck off.

347
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,280
You deserve to be the first
to go out and check, Koh.

348
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,760
If it weren't for you,

349
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,840
every single one of us would have left
before all of this went down.

350
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,360
But because of you, we are stuck here.

351
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,840
What? You're gonna blame me, yeah?

352
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,560
Why don't you blame this on our fucking
teacher for giving us all detention?

353
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240
I did my job.

354
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,840
You didn't do yours.

355
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, great. Blame everything on me.

356
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,040
I guess they should blame me as well then.

357
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,560
I'm not blaming you, Koh.

358
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Then how about this?

359
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,440
Let's take a vote

360
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
on who should go first.

361
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,720
If you think Koh should go,

362
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
raise your hand.

363
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Sa.

364
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
What are you doing?

365
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
He shouldn't go out there alone.

366
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,120
[Sa] I feel bad for him.

367
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
This isn't the first time

368
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,000
you stuck up for him.

369
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,400
What's going on?

370
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,840
Nothing. I don't want him to get hurt.

371
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,720
[Suer] Are you sure?

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If it makes you feel better,
then I'll vote for Koh.

373
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,200
Fuck off.

374
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
How could you do that?

375
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
Everyone voted for you to go.

376
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,480
-Go on, get out.
-Do you really think

377
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,920
that I'll go get help?

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,560
If I get out of here, you'll see.

379
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,800
If I get away,
I won't give a shit about any of you.

380
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,040
Prepare to die in here.

381
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,320
That's true.

382
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
If all of you did that to me,

383
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,960
I definitely wouldn't call
for help either.

384
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,360
[Kaew] Let me ask you.

385
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,880
Who are you?

386
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
Why haven't we seen your face
at school before?

387
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, I forgot.

388
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,640
So, let's see.

389
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
My name is Nanno.

390
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Today is my very first day here.

391
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm a new student in grade 11, class four.

392
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,200
I also seem to have incredibly bad luck.

393
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,960
On my first day of school,

394
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,680
a psychopath escapes from prison.

395
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,160
How about this, then?

396
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,040
If you feel so bad for him,
then you can go with him.

397
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,600
Both go find people to help us.

398
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
Of course, I could go with him.

399
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,200
But I still haven't figured out

400
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,800
why I should get people
to help any of you.

401
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,120
And the kid? You don't feel bad for her?

402
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
How ironic that the one who lied

403
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,000
and refused to give the kid any water

404
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,400
is asking me to show sympathy.

405
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,440
If we had to choose the one
most likely to come back and save us,

406
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,080
wouldn't it be the adult here?

407
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,960
Because he would have to come back
for his daughter.

408
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,000
If I go out there,

409
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,920
-I'm taking Tang with me--
-Also…

410
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,960
you're a teacher.

411
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,880
You're responsible for your students.

412
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Koh.

413
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
I won't go anyways.

414
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,400
Why not? You have a box cutter.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
You have one, too.

416
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,320
Why don't we make Suer go?

417
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,960
[Koh] That's a good idea.

418
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,720
Suer would have to come back for Sa.

419
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,360
I'm not going. I'm staying with Sa.

420
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,320
Come to think of it,
isn't Kaew in the student council?

421
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,160
Haven't you pledged to help
your fellow students?

422
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,960
But I don't have anything to fight with.

423
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm happy to give you my cutter.

424
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,760
-[sighs]
-That's enough.

425
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
Stop changing the subject.

426
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,160
Everyone voted for you to go,
so you have to go. Go!

427
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,840
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

428
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,040
-That's right.
-[Tor] Go.

429
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,480
My ass. Listen to yourselves.
[scoffs]

430
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,040
[Kaew] Whatever. We voted.

431
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,040
You have to go
and find someone to rescue us now.

432
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,680
If you're able to get us help,

433
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,160
I'll make sure you pass this year.

434
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh.

435
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,120
Is that how you wanna play?

436
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,080
Yes.

437
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,200
Fine. I'll go get help.

438
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
-[door creaks]
-[Koh gasps]

439
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
[foreboding music]

440
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,200
Shit.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,120
[Suer] What is it?

442
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,960
What?

443
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,000
The body is gone.

444
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,160
She came back to get the body.

445
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,920
Fuck! We were too loud.

446
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,880
She has to know that we're in here.

447
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,880
We were arguing
because you wouldn't go for help.

448
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
[Kaew] Koh.

449
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,520
Listen to me.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,280
Maybe the body wasn't taken
by the murderer but by somebody else.

451
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,280
The police might have come to investigate
without knowing that we were here.

452
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,200
How could they not know? We were too loud.

453
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,480
[exhales deeply]
I won't go.

454
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
[Kaew] If you won't go,
then what's your plan?

455
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
You're just gonna sit there?

456
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,160
[Koh] That's exactly what I'm doing.

457
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,040
If we keep quiet for 15 minutes,

458
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,720
then I'll go, okay?

459
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,760
[clock ticking]

460
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
[tense music]

461
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,840
Someone open the door for me.

462
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
The door.

463
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,320
You want me to get help, right?

464
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,160
[Kaew whimpers]

465
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,080
-[Tor] Koh!
-[screaming]

466
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,080
-[Boong] Hey!
-[Duang] Kaew!

467
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
-[Suer] What are you doing?
-[Kaew] Koh! What the fuck are you doing?

468
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
Let me in right now.

469
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
Weren't you the one who said that

470
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,960
the body is gone
because the police were here?

471
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,160
[doorknob clanking]

472
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
If that's what you believe, then go.

473
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,280
I won't fall for your shit.

474
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,120
After all, you pledge to serve us
at the student council.

475
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,160
We voted for you way before
you all voted for me. So go serve us!

476
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,080
-[Kaew] Fuck you! Let me in!
-[doorknob clanking]

477
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
[Koh] You should go now

478
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,560
before the murderer comes back.

479
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
What's wrong?

480
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,400
Do you want to join her?

481
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
What a gentleman, pushing a girl outside.

482
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,640
[Kaew] Koh, fuck you!

483
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,880
I'm more of a gentleman than you.
You sad excuse for an adult.

484
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,680
[phone rings]

485
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
[Suer] Is someone calling you?

486
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,920
[ringing continues]

487
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
It's Kaew. She's video-calling me.

488
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,760
The reception is really bad.

489
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
[breathing heavily]

490
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,840
Kaew!

491
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,640
Kaew!

492
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,120
-Hello.
-[Boong] Kaew.

493
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,960
What should we do? She can't hear us.

494
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,600
[Kaew] Boong.

495
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,160
-Boong.
-[Boong] Kaew. Can you hear me now?

496
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,160
It's…

497
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,800
It's really dark out here

498
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,960
and very, very quiet.

499
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,760
I don't think

500
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
anyone's in the school anymore.

501
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,200
Kaew, leave through the front gate
and then call the police for help.

502
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,160
That's what I'm doing right now.

503
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,720
[Boong] What's wrong, Kaew?

504
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
What's happening?

505
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
-Kaew, get out of there.
-[Suer] What is it?

506
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,560
You should leave. Go.

507
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,600
It could be the murderer.
Get away from there!

508
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,800
What if it's someone who can rescue me?

509
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,280
Kaew, listen to me.
Leave now. Don't go in there!

510
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
[Boong] Kaew!

511
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,800
-It's so dangerous. Just leave.
-[Kaew] Fuck.

512
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
What the fuck is this?

513
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,520
[panting]

514
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,480
It's dangerous. Just go.

515
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,920
Okay, you just leave.

516
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
Run!

517
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,120
-[Suer] Shit.
-[Koh] Kaew, why are you running away?

518
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,880
-Shit.
-Why aren't you going for help?

519
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,600
[Kaew] Fuck you, Koh. Shut the fuck up!

520
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,120
I'm out here because of you.

521
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,880
This should be you, you fucking asshole!
This is all your fault!

522
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
-Kaew.
-[Suer] Hey!

523
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,560
-Kaew! Kaew!
-Get out of there!

524
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,360
-[clattering]
-[Suer] No.

525
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,040
[breathing heavily]

526
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,240
It hanged up.

527
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,840
[sobbing]

528
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,680
It hanged up on me.

529
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,800
What should we do now?

530
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
What?

531
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,680
This is your fault.
You pushed Kaew out there.

532
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,720
You all were forcing me to go,
but I didn't want to.

533
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,120
[Tor] But I agree.

534
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,160
If someone should go and find Kaew,
it should be Koh.

535
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
[Suer] I agree.

536
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,160
But I think that…

537
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,120
Fine. You win. I'll go.

538
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,920
Being here is worse
than anything out there.

539
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
[desk clatters]

540
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,680
[door clanks]

541
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,320
Tang. Tang.

542
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
All right.

543
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,560
I'm not so sure that

544
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Koh is gonna be of any help here.

545
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
What if he just takes off?

546
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
Oh.

547
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,920
Koh is not like that at all.

548
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,800
He will definitely go and help Kaew.

549
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,800
You've stuck up for Koh

550
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,720
so many times now.

551
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,960
Why are you so worried about him? Tell me.

552
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
It's not like that.

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,120
I just don't want people to misjudge him.

554
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
If you don't believe
that Koh went to help Kaew,

555
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,400
then why don't you try calling him?

556

[phone ringing]

561
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,920
-[Koh] Hello?
-Koh, you answered.

562
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,520
[Koh] I came out here to look for Kaew
but I can't find her.

563
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,480
[Sa] You see?

564
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,520
I told you that Koh isn't like that.

565
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,800
Since you're out there, why don't you go

566
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,840
and see if you can find somebody
to help us?

567
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,600
[Koh] To be honest,
I don't wanna help anyone.

568
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,280
Can you do it for me, then?

569
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,480
Can you help me out?

570
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,280
[Koh] Fine.

571
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,640
I'll figure something out. I gotta go now.

572
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,280
Help is on the way, okay?

573
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,400
Excuse me.

574
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,880
You can't go out there right now.

575
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,840
Do you want me to pee in here?

576
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,800
Koh has gone to get help.

577
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,640
Just be patient.

578
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,360
I think you should wait here

579
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,280
in case the killer is nearby.

580
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,360
If she forces her way in here,
you and I can protect the others.

581
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,520
You're a strong man.

582
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
You can protect everyone.

583
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
Bye.

584
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080

[breathing heavily]

587
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
[Sa] Can anyone else
get through to anyone?

588
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
[Tor coughs]

589
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Come and sit down, Sa.

590
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,920
[breathing heavily]

591
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,680
What do you want?

592
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,920
Nothing.

593
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,520
Just say what's on your mind.

594
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,320
If we do get out of here, then…

595
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,480
there'll probably be an investigation

596
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,280
in to the girl who died in the hallway.

597
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,680
I did it to protect all of you.

598
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,360
Everyone knows.

599
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,480
[Nanno] Everyone in here does.

600
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,840
But Koh…

601
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,640
If Koh manages to finds help for us,

602
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,440
everyone will consider him a hero.

603
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
People will be more likely

604
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
to listen to him

605
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,560
than to you,

606
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,760
Suer, Kaew, Sa,

607
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Duang, or Boong.

608
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,440
What kind of father
do you think Tang wants to have?

609
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,320
A father who kept everyone safe

610
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,760
but is known to be a murderer,

611
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,600
or a father who was a hero

612
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,280
because he saved us all?

613
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
[Tor] Tang.

614
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,560
Daddy's gonna go find help.

615
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,320
I need you to stay here with them.

616
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,440
[Tang] No.

617
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,600
But, sir, what if the killer comes in?

618
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,480
You girls will find a way.

619
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,440
You will.

620
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,840
But, Dad…

621
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,600
I have to leave you here, Tang.

622
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,719
Come on.

623
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480

624
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
lock the door.

[door lock clicks]

626
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,600
How come you had to say that to him?

627
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Don't you know how scary it is
for us to be left alone?

628
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,800
How scary is it?

629
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,360
We have no weapons to defend ourselves.

630
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
If something happens…

631
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,640
You're smiling?

632
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,440
[laughs]

633
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,680
Come over here.

634
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
Do you remember when she showed us
the picture of the murderer?

635
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,840
She had the exact same haircut as Nanno.

636
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,640
[Duang] Oh, no.

637
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,360
And she lured all of the guys out--

638
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,640
[laughing]

639
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,120
It's you, right? You're the killer!

640
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,920
Is that what you girls think?

641
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,520
Why were you laughing?

642
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,520
You admit that you're her by laughing.

643
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,080
How could I not laugh at you?

644
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,240
You girls think
that I'm some psycho killer

645
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
even though I was with you

646
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,880
when the killing first started.

647
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
And, Boong,

648
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,000
didn't you say that
you saw the so-called murderer?

649
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,360
It's true, I did see her,
but I didn't see her clearly.

650
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,120
It could have been you. Isn't that right?

651
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,680
Didn't someone get stabbed out
in the hallway

652
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,680
when this lady
was inside the room here with us?

653
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
[claps]

654
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,240
Great, Tang.

655
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
You're smarter than all of them together.

656
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,960
Why are you playing
with the box cutter, then?

657
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,000
[Nanno] No reason.

658
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,280
I just wanna make sure
that it works just fine

659
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
in case I need to use it on someone.

660
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,680
[footsteps in distance]

661
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,360
-Shit. Is that the killer?
-Shh. Shut up.

662
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
[male student screams]

663
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,160
Is that Koh?

664
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,080
We should go and help him.

665
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,480
Come on.

666
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,320
Suer left a long time ago
but all you care about is Koh.

667
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,720
My boyfriend isn't screaming.

668
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
If it was Suer,
I would go and help him, too.

669
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,440
-Come on. Let's go.
-[Duang] Wait.

670
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,920
Are you crazy? I'm staying.

671
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,120
You can go by yourself if you want to.

672
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I wanna go with you. I wanna find my dad.

673
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,240
-Come on.
-I'll go with you then.

674
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Hey, Boong.

675
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,040
Please don't go.
Someone will come for us soon.

676
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,120
You still think that someone
will come for us?

677
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,800
As long as this kid is with us,
Mr. Tor will come back for her for sure.

678
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,560
The kid just said
she wants to find her dad.

679
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,320
[Tang] Let's go. I'm worried about my dad.

680
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
If you wanna stay, then stay.
I'm out of here.

681
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
Can you not put pressure on me like that?

682
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,400
I don't wanna stay here
with this new girl.

683
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
Who said I was staying with you?

684
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,680
I'm going with them.

685
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,920
It's better for us to stick together.

686
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,840
At least one of you

687
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,720
will be the bait for the murderer
so I can run to safety.

688
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,560
Hey, Tang.

689
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,200
What do you say, are you a big girl
who can be the bait?

690
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,200
What are you saying?

691
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Nobody was thinking that.

692
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,800
Is that so? Forgive me.

693
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
[Duang] Wait.

694
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,840
I'll go with you.

695
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,240
[whispering]
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

696
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
Keep a lookout.
If you see something, say something.

697
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,920
Okay.

698
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,280
[Sa] What are you doing?

699
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,680
I wanna take everyone to my dad.

700
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,680
[Boong] Are you calling Koh?

701
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,120
If he's with the murderer…

702
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,400
We'll go and save him, right?

703
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,960
[Boong] We'll know where to stay away.

704
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,680
Why are you so awful?

705
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,960
[Boong] Sacrifices have to be made.

706
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,760
I'm thinking of ways to…

707
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,440
to keep the rest of us alive.

708
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,560
Boong is right.

709
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
Koh might be our last hope.

710
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,200
Hurry up and call him. Now.

711
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,480
[Tang] My phone isn't working right.

712
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
Mine's working.

713
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Where's Koh? We'll go the other way.

714
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,200
He's over there.

715
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,960
We'll go this way.

716
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Shit!

717
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,520
Fuck.

718
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,600
[panting]

719
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,520
What's wrong?

720
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,240
Ah, fuck.

721
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,000
[Duang] Of course Sa
didn't take us to safety.

722
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,080
She fucking brought us to Koh.

723
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,560
-You bitch!
-That's not true.

724
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,640
What is not true?

725
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
I saw it. Let us look at it then.

726
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
-[Sa] Let go!
-My phone!

727
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Let me see.

728
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,640
No.

729
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,080
You won't show us because
you're taking us to Koh, aren't you?

730
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,360
You guys are so selfish.

731
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,320
You only care about yourselves.

732
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,000
[Duang] You will get us all killed,
you know?

733
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,720
You can go alone.

[Sa] Why?

742
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,280
It's Koh.

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,280
What should we do?

00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360

[girls crying]

758
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,760
[reporter] This evening, a serial killer
who was previously convicted 

759
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,160
of killing eight students
broke out of prison and returned

760
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,040
to the scene of the crime carrying out
yet another vicious attack.

761
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,240
The killer injured three students
before attempting to escape

762
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,760
when they saw her fall to her death
from the roof of the school building.

763
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,400
The campus has been under
police lockdown since late this evening.

764
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,760
Are you telling us that the three students
who are found to be

765
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,520
severely injured are okay now?

766
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,560
They are fine.

767
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,760
[reporter] That is all we know so far.

768
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,480
-[Tor] What?
-[reporter] We will continue to update…

769
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,760
How is that possible?

770
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,760
Didn't a student die outside
of our classroom?

771
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,640
What?

772
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,560
We thought you were dead.

773
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,120
I… I had an asthma attack.

774
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,720
I tend to faint
when I'm in an intense situations.

775
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,240
Well…

776
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,160
if that's the case,

777
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,120
then I wonder who…

778
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,280
ended up killing Koh?

779
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,840
Hmm…

780
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,000
Suer was totally overcome with jealousy.

781
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,560
-[Koh screams]
-[grunts]

782
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,760
Perhaps Tor didn't want Koh to tell people
what happened in the classroom.

783
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,440
[Tor grunts]

784
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,680
Or it could have been Kaew who was angry
with Koh for pushing her out of the room.

785
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,920
[Kaew screams]

786
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,960
In all honesty,

787
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,800
if it weren't for Tang here,

788
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
the three of you would have ganged up
and killed me by now, wouldn't you?

789
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,080
What?

790
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,440
Forget about it.

791
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,880
The real mystery remains.

792
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
What are we gonna do with Koh?

793
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,200
I'll let you geniuses decide.

794
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,600
Let's go, Tang.

795
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,320
How about we go and find Duang's phone?

796
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,040
I saw it fall into the drain.

797
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,400
We could really use
your small hands to get it out.

798
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,320
Can you get it for me, please?

799
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,640
This phone is very important.

800
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,160
Why is it so important to you?

801
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,760
The phone isn't even yours.

802
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,280
Hmm…

803
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,760
That phone recorded everything
that happened in the classroom.

804
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,800
It will be a key piece of evidence

805
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,640
that will be used to find who killed Koh

806
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,840
and the people who willingly let him die,
like your father for example.

807
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,560
So, can you please get it for me?

808
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,400
I can't reach it. It's too deep.

809
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,120
Sweet Tang.

810
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,480
[Nanno] You're such a good daughter.

811
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,200
You'll have a bright future
