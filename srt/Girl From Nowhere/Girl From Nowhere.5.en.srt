I'm sorry.

I'm just so glad you were there
to rescue me.

189

Hey.

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Your hands are shaking like crazy.

193
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm still a little scared.

194
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,680
There's just so much going on in my mind.

195
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
[female student 1] Get her already.

196
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
[female student 2] Why don't you
hold her hands and soothe her, Hann?

-[Jer] You're perfect for each other.
-Stop it.

206
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
Stop it. Come on, everyone.

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,920
You know she's taken.

208
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,800
Actually, I'm not.

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,160
-Whoa. She's not.
-[students giggling]

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Do you have a girlfriend, Hann?

Uh…

212
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,360
No. I'm single.

No, we shouldn't.

220
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
You're just putting Hann on the spot.

221
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,640
I understand that this is
too good to be true.

222
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
It just can't be.

223
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,160
Thank you so much for rescuing me.

224
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm guess I'm gonna head out now.

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Stop.

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
What?

228
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,960
Will you date me?

[murmuring]

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
[Nanno] All right. I would
love to be your girlfriend.

232
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,080
However,

233
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
I do have one condition.

234
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,920
-[excited cries]
-What is that?

235
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
As my boyfriend,

236
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,640
you can't ever leave me.

237
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
[students screaming]

238
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,920

[clicking]

241
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,440
Nanno is new to our school.

242
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh! She's a sweet girl,

243
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,360
and I know she's very lively too.

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,560
-She's nice.
-Yes, she's nice.

245
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
-And friendly.
-She's adapting very well.

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,760
Better than us even.

247
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,480
We've been here since 7th grade,

248
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
-but we still haven't settled in.
-[laughing]

249
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
Everyone knows that these two
are a couple,

250
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,280
so if they are showing PDA,

251
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,440
it's pretty standard.

252
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,360
[Jer] Hey, you two.

253
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Where you there when they got together?

254
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,280
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

255
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,480
-We can go inside, right?
-[giggling]

256
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Right here.

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,000
If they're really a couple,

258
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,600
I would like to offer this poem

259
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
to Hann and Nanno.

260
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,480
"Nanno, the new girl,

261
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,480
so beautiful and lively at first glance.

262
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
Hann then finally is going to ask her out

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,680
in the hope of finding true love."

264
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, I'm happy for her because…

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
she has Hann all to herself.

266
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
You know?

267
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,240
I want him for myself.
[laughing]

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,040
But Hann and Nanno are a perfect couple.

269
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
They're going to last until eternity.

270
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
I think he's so hot.

271
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
"They are…

272
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,160
the perfect couple in every single way.

273
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
There's is an eternal love.

274
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,480
May their souls never part.

275
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,680
May their love live on in their hearts."

276
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
-[Jer] Yeah.
-Hmm?

277
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Hey there, Hann. Listen.

278
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,520
You promised that
you will love Nanno forever.

-And ever.
