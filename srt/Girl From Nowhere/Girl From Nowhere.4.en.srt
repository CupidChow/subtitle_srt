WHAT CAN MONEY BUY?

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,920
That room is our lab
for botany experiments.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,040
That's for the students who love nature.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
And this is our room
for sewing and textiles.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,880
That's for the students
who are interested in fashion.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,400
Although the school has many
extracurricular activities,

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,440
we still prioritize academics
or the students.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,360
Most importantly, we have received
many academic awards.

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
[teacher] What's the matter?

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
Whose names are in the wall here?

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,720
Oh, these are the names of the parents
who have donated money the rooms.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,160
Let me show you the other rooms, okay?

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,120
[Nanno, in thought]
Money. What can it buy?

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
A room?

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,920
Fame?

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
Objects.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Social standing.

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Maybe…

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,560
money can buy even more than that.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
[teacher]
And that's all the rooms we have.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,160
The rest are empty until we get
more donations from the parents.

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,840
Let me show you
the classrooms downstairs, yeah?

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,440
What's the matter?

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,880
If I wanted to buy this room,

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
that wouldn't be a problem, right?

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,960
[whirring]

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you so much.

[student 1] What are we eating tonight?

35
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
[student 2]
I'm not hungry. Let's go bowling.

36
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
[student 3] Hey, I want to have sushi.

37
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
-[student 4] Yeah.
-[student 2] But when I see your hair,

38
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,880
I want to have egg noodles.

39
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
[all laughing]

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,880

-Hey, it's in fashion right now.

41
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
-Here's your souvenirs.
-Oh!

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
-[screaming, ululating]
-Hey!

43
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,320
-[both cheer]
-Yeah!

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
-Hey, why are you guys screaming about?
-That's a lot.

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
You're acting like you've never been
to England before.

46
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
[Tap] Hey, we screamed
because we're excited…

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,840
Guys, you each owe me 2,000 baht
like you said.

48
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,560
-That's just your allowance. Hurry.
-Come on. Hurry.

49
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,840
We all made a quick bet if you would buy
more souvenirs than To.

50
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Damn. You way outdid him this time. Look.

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,640
I thought I bought too much stuff.

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,960
Man! You got way more shit than I did!

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,320
[Whan laughs]

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,800
To, why didn't you follow him around
to see what he bought

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,840
and then buy one thing more than him?

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
You traveled together, didn't you?

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,360
Yeah, I made plans with him,
but he was never free to hang out.

58
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,520
Hey, I had to spend time with
my parents too. I never get to see them.

59
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,640
And you invited me to a football match,
but your seats were behind the goal.

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,400
I never sit there.

61
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,960
DINO AND FRIENDS

62
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Dino, well, he…

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,800
Dino is the kind of person who…
How do we say it?

64
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Actually, if I didn't know him for years,

65
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,920
I would think
he's a typical stuck-up rich person

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
because he's someone
who seems to have everything.

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
I mean, he's rich, and he comes
from a family with a lot of influence

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
and people just can't get to know him.

69
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,600
He's the kind of person who likes to bring
a lot of expensive things, man.

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Everything he buys is the best that money
can get you, you know what I mean?

71
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,280
For example, the car he drives
is very expensive.

72
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
Everything he has
is what adults can afford

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,160
but not at all a kid would buy, you know?

74
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,160
I invited you for a dinner at my hotel,
but you didn't come.

75
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,200
Did you have the duck
at the Four Seasons instead

76
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,760
for the rest of the Thai first group?

77
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,200
[laughing]

78
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Didn't you say there was
a government minister with you

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,040
at the Tower Bridge that day,
enjoying the scenery?

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
Who would wanna go to that?

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
-To.
-What?

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
You really suck.

83
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
You need to learn
how to do some networking.

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,160
-[To] Why?
-Just in case

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,840
you decide to become a government minister
in the future, you know?

86
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,760
I don't think I can become
a government minister.

87
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,760
[Pop] Fuck. You aim low.

88
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,320
Dino?

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
I think he likes to show off a bit.

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
I don't know.
Hey, this is just my opinion.

91
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
I asked a few of my friends
what they thought.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,320
I think he's a bit jealous of me.
I'm not really sure.

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,840
But he's so rich.

94
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,280
A new car…

95
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,200
I think he might end of owning Thailand.

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,520
-[Pop] Hey, guys.
-Stop. You're giving me a hard time.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,720
I saw someone's name in that room. Nanno?

98
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,160
Who the hell is that?

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,680
[Whan] Oh, that's the new student.

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,200
She bought a room here on her first day.
She's filthy rich.

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Why did she do that?

102
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,720
[Nanno] To start a company.

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
Hello, I'm Nanno,

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,920
and I'm the new owner of the room
and the company.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,960
Here.

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Here.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,960
What do you do?

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,480
[teacher] Good morning, everyone.

109
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Fuck.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
-[Pop] Here we go again.
-Welcome back to school.

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,640
It's nice to see everyone back again.

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,840
Today, we will start the new term by…

113
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
giving you last term's grade.

114
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
[all boo]

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,800
[Pop] I don't want it.

116
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,240
Remember, what goes around
comes around, huh?

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,200
Here.

118
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,400
I really don't wanna see
my grades, though.

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
[teacher] And for you.

120
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
Let's look at it at the same time.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,840
-I got 2.48.
-One, two.

122
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,960
[groans]

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,800
You got 3.36?

124
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Fuck. This is so unfair.

125
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Look at my grades. It's so bad.

126
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,680
My parents promised
to give me a motorbike.

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,440
But they're totally going to downgrade
to a scooter when they see these grades.

128
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
[Nanno] I can help you get the motorcycle.

129
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,760
[Pop] How?

130
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,400
Make an appointment with me.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,160
NANNO COMPANY LIMITED

132
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
-Yeah.
-That'd be cool.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah.

134
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
You promised to get me a motorcycle, yeah?

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Oh, I can get it for you,

136
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
but that will require a little bit of work

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
and that will require
a little processing fee.

138
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
It's this much.

139
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
I think that's pretty cheap,

140
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,800
compared to the price
of the motorcycle that you want.

141
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
-What do you think?
-Just try it. I would do it.

142
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,520
-Yeah.
-What about you, man?

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,560
It's cheap.

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,760
-Yeah.
-[Whan] Come on, just do it.

145
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
[Nanno] Great. Thank you very much.

146
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
Give me your report card.

147
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll process this right away.

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,480
[Whan] Just give it to her.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,920
Why does she want it?

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,240
[Whan] I don't know. Just do it.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,720
-[Pop] Hey.
-[Whan] What?

152
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
[Pop] Hey.

153
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,440
-[Whan] What's she doing?
-[Dino] Is she really going to…

154
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
[groans]

155
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
[Whan laughing]
Shit.

156
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,080
-My report card.
-[Whan chuckling]

157
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,160
[Whan] Guys, look. She's recreating it.

158
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,400
[suspenseful music playing]

159
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
[Pop] How did she do that?

-[Pop] I could just give my parents this?
-Yeah, wait a second.

161
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm sure you'll get your motorcycle now.

162
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
Yeah.

163
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,240
They're just the same.

164
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah, they're exactly the same.

165
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,360
[Nanno] I can do other things as well.

166
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,480
What else can you do?

167
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,440
[Nanno] Well, pretty much anything.

Can Nanno Company really do
anything we want?

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Look at that.

-Pat!
-You're begging?

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,920
-Please!
-You're begging?

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480

Pat!

Here. Get me a pretty one, yeah?

181
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm so proud of you.
You got yourself a girlfriend.

182
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Here's a check for you.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,040
-Appreciate it, Dad.
-She's really adorable.

184
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
CAN YOU DO THAT
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FRIEND?

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay, that's it for today.
See you all tomorrow.

186
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,120
[Pop] Goodbye, ma'am. See ya.

187
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
Guys, let's go.

188
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,760
-Dino, I have a question.
-[Pop] I'm hungry.

189
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,680
Isn't there something I can help you with?

190
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
-I'm already hungry.
-Nah.

191
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
Are you gonna play snooker alone?

192
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,600
Come on, Nanno.
He doesn't need any of your help.

193
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,880
His family is wealthy.
He gets good grades.

194
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,200
His parents live abroad.
He doesn't have a cheating girlfriend.

195
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,640
Let's just say if you have any problems,
Dino can help you.

196
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
Dude, are you crazy or something?

197
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160
Her company is already so big.
Why would she need my help?

198
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
Well, she doesn't need
to worry about that,

199
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,640
because the next customer
is going to be me.

200
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,120
What do you need her help with?

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,120
I wanna go out, but not to a nightclub
or anything like that.

202
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,840
I want to go way over night,

203
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,680
so I want Nanno to write a letter
to my parents.

204
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Let's say there's a camp
or something like that, okay?

205
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,160
Hmm. What about Dhamma Camp?

206
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,280
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
I always love going to Dhamma Camp.

207
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,760
What?

208
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,080
-Let me go, too.
-Yeah.

209
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,800
You can't come up with it yourself?
Are you copying me?

210
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,520
Yeah, I am, but I'm also thinking
of my friends, bringing all them with me.

211
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
-Tap, To, Nanno, and Dino, too.
-I'll come.

212
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,680
-Unlike you.
-Yeah, right.

213
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Just let her go on a trip by herself.

214
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
[Whan] Hey, what the hell. Let me go, too.

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,840
-You're too late.
-[Whan] No way.

216
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,320
-Are we going to Osaka?
-Oh, come on.

217
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,520
-I'm going too.
-Oh, no fucking way.

218
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm bored of Osaka.

219
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,320
-Let's go to Hong Kong. I want congee.
-No.

220
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,520
-I want to wear bikinis, you guys.
-I'm going, too.

221
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm going, too. Hello.

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,560
-I'm going, too.
-Okay, okay.

223
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,160
You can come as well, all right.
I feel bad for you.

224
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,280
-You're right.
-But you know what…

225
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
You can't choose where we go.

226
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,120
-Hey.
-Dino, where are we going?

227
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm tired of going abroad.

228
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
Fuck, he's bored.

229
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,600
-Rich people are like this.
-Yeah, I guess that's true.

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,640
He has been traveling abroad
since he was ten.

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,040
Who wouldn't get bored with that?

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,600
Then let's go somewhere in Thailand, yeah?

233
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
Ugh, but I'm so bored of Thailand.

234
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,160
-That's so lame.
-What shall we do?

235
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't care.

236
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,160
-Why don't we go to a tea plantation?
-I don't want to.

237
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
Can I suggest a place too?

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,320
I wanna go to Dino's house.

239
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,160
Damn. That'd be rad.

240
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
I've heard a lot of great things about it,

241
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,840
so I want to see your big mansion
with my own eyes.

242
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
There's really nothing special.
It's just a normal house.

243
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,040
From what I've heard,
this house has a big, beautiful garden.

244
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,880
There's a massive swimming pool, a golf
room, a snooker room, and much more.

245
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,800
It's completely clean…

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
…that you can go horseback riding there.
It's so big.

247
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,400
Tons of horses,
many expensive horses, I think.

248
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,880
I heard he has…

249
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,040
everything that…

250
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,520
we, normal people…

251

252
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
Like servants who will take off
your shoes. They'll do anything.

253
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,360
And people to serve them breakfast in bed
whatever you want in the morning.

254
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
Uh, I'm afraid you're gonna be sloppy
and break things.

255
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
Oh, god.

256
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
But, but, but…

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
I promise that I'll be the one
who watches these guys,

258
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,600
if anyone breaks anything in your house.

259
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,360
I just wanna visit your house, even just
once in my lifetime, you know, Dino?

260
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,480
It's not about the responsibility. It's…

261
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,000
-Come on, Dino. We're your best friends.
-[Tap] Yeah.

262
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,520
I think you can trust your friends.
Why don't you trust us?

263
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Yeah, or maybe you don't
consider us your friends, yeah?

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
-[Dino] No, come on.
-Exactly.

265

-Of course, you're my friends.
-[To] Yeah.

266
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,920
-Come on.
-What's up with you?

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
-Just do it.
-Please?

268

-Come on.
-Yeah.

269
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,040
-Hey, do it for your friends.
-Hey, stop. Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

-Take the light room.
-Each take one.

274
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
I'll meet you up later.

-Bye now. See you.
-Bye.

276
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,880
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

277
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,360
I'll have that letter
for Dhamma Camp, if you want it.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Thank you.

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,440
I already bought a new dress
for the party at Dino's.

316
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,560
Here's the theme. The theme… "Celebrity."

317
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,480
[Whan chuckles]

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
[cell phone beeps]

319
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,920
No way.
Let's dress up as movie characters.

320
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,800
[cell phone beeps]

321
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,200
I have old glam outfits
for the red carpet.

322
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,920
[cell phone beeps]

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,040
Hey, can you guys stop chatting
and get in your fancy clothes already?

324
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,960
Get dressed. Come on.

325
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
[line ringing]

326
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,560
[line ringing]

327
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
[Nanno] Hello?

328
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
Turns out I do need your help,
but can you keep a secret?

329
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,640
Of course, I can.

330
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,440
Client requests are always
strictly confidential.

331
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
I want you to…

332
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,480
change my friends' minds.

333
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh, why is that?

334
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,080
Hey, I think it would be easier to solve
the problem by helping at your house,

335
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,960
because your friends,
they really wanna go.

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,960
[Nanno chuckles softly]

337
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,440
-My house…
-What about it?

338
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,360
[Dino clicks teeth]

339
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,080
-I have valuable things there.
-Hmm.

340
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,360
So, I don't want them to come.

341
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
Uh-huh.

342
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Is there any way to do it?
Change their mind?

343
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
Maybe it would be better…

344
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
if you find another house.

345
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,600
Is that what you really want?

346
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,320
Mm-hmm.

347
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,120
A house that they would like.

348
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,120
Let me see…

349
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
what that'll cost you.

350
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,560
200,000.

351
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,280
That's cheap, right?

352
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,760
Yeah.

353
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
All right, then.
Please give me the cash tomorrow.

354
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,160
Is that okay with you?

355
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
Okay.

356
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
-Hey, Mom.
-Mm?

357
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Is there anything to eat?

358
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh, there's watermelon in the fridge.

359
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
[Dino's mom] Did you find it?

360
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,040
Yes, I did.

361
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
[Dino's mom] Dino.

362
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
I'm sorry I didn't remove the seeds.

363
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,440
It's okay, Mom.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
[Dino's mom]
Have you gotten your bonus yet?

365
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,960
The loan sharks won't stop asking.

366
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
[Dino's dad] Why do they keep on asking?

367
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,200
It's like we don't have a child
to take care of.

368
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,480
-Have you received it?
-We need to pay for Dino's tuition.

369
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,640
Have you gotten it?

370
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,960
Yes, in our bank account.

371
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,880
-How much is it?
-It's 200,000 baht.

372
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Good. We can pay them back right away,

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,200
because I've heard if anyone
doesn't pay them back,

374
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
they'll hire a gangster to kill them.

375
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,320
[Dino's dad] Yeah, I know.

376
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,160
Dino, you're a big liar.

377
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Fuck you! How can we be friends
with someone like you for this long?

378
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,520
You lived in a crappy house, but you
always act like you were so freaking cool.

379
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,400
You fucking smell that?
You reek of a poor, Dino.

380
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
[suspenseful music playing]

[beeping slows down]

385
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,200
Hey, Dino.

386
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,160
What are you doing?

387
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,760
I was just getting some water.

388
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,240
You can pour me a glass, too.

389
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,240
Here you go.

390
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,840
Very good, son.

391
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,160
-I'm going back to bed.
-Mm.

392
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,680
-Don't stay up late, okay?
-Okay.

393

[somber music playing]

394
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,920
AN ORDINARY MORNING

395
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,240
[Dino's dad]
Hey, I told you my money is gone.

396
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,680
Wait a minute.

397
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,560
How can you not take responsibility

398
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,760
when my debit card is still here,
but the money has disappeared?

399
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,400
Don't you understand?

400
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,200
Just go. It's nothing.

401
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,760
Excuse me, are you really accusing
someone in my family of stealing?

402
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,800
Hey, you're not taking any responsibility.

403
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,640
I don't know. I don't know.

404
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,520
You stop and listen.

405
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,440
My bank card was with me the entire night.

406
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,280
What? Who else would go
and take the money out?

407
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,720
This is your fault. Check the account,
find the money, and put it back.

408
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,920
That's it. Yeah.

409
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,480
They should pay us back no matter what.

410
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,880
What if we don't get it back?

411
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,920
[Dino's dad sighs]
I don't know.

412
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,200
DINO'S HOUSE

413
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,720
How is it? Do you like it?

414
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,560
[Dino] Actually, it's a bit small.

415
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,760
Really? Do you want me to look
for a new one for you?

416
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,240
It's fine.

417
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,720
Can you show me around the house?

418
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,600
I want to see how similar it is to mine.

419
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Of course.

420
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,240
WHO WOULD BE AS FREE AS DINO?

423
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,920
[Whan] Fuck.

424
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,560
-[Pop] Whoa.
-[Whan] Shit.

425
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,560
This is your house?

426
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,040
-[Pop] Wow.
-[To] It's so big.

427
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,480
[Tap] Hey, you prepared an afternoon tea
for us, too? It looks really delicious.

428
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
[To] Oh, my god.

429
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,160
-[Pop] Where are you going?
-[Dino] You don't come here every day.

430
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,600
[Whan]
Hey, is this from the era of Louis XIV?

431
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,520
-It's so soft.
-Yeah.

432
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
That's right. My dad has good taste.

433
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,040
Dino, can I play golf?

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,760
[Dino] Be careful not to destroy my house.

435
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,880
-Yeah, I'll be careful.
-[Tap] Let's take pictures.

436
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,760
-[Whan] Yeah.
-We're not gonna come back here.

437
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Hey, can I smoke this, man?

438
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,080
[Dino] Go ahead. My dad won't notice.

439
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,200
[Pop] It smells nice.

440
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,600
What are you guys so excited for?

441
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,720
You act like you've never seen
this kind of stuff.

442
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,240
Our dads keep that kind of stuff
in our room.

443
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,160
We're not allowed to touch it.

444
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,560
That's totally true, actually.

445
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,680
None of us have this much freedom as you.

446
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,120
[blows]

447
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,640
I think you should hold off
on smoking that.

448
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
If you wanna smoke it,
you should have a whiskey, too.

449
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
Right, Dino?

450
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,880
-I'll get it, then.
-Which brand is the fur?

451
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
You don't need to.

452
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,800
I don't know. I took my mom's.

453
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,120
You can call the servants.

454
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,480
Yeah, right. Why get it yourself, man?

455
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,440
-Mm-mm.
-[Dino] Oh, yeah.

456
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,240

[chuckles]

457

Oh, my god.

-[Tap] He's a rich kid.
-[Pop] Oh, that's great.

460
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,920
Dino, whiskey.

461
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,480
-[Pop] What about you?
-[To] I want tea.

462
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Whiskey.

463
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
[Pop] Excuse me.
I would like some whiskey.

464
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Yes. As you wish.

465
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,800
[Tap] Yeah, I want whiskey, too.

466
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,560
[To] Tap, which kind of tea this is?

467
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,960
Are you all right, Dino?

468
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,240
-Yeah.
-[Tap] I think it's Earl Grey tea.

469
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,520
-All right, then.
-I had this in London before.

470
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,480
[To] Oh.

471
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,640
[Whan] Hey, Dino.

472
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
Why don't your parents have
any pictures in the house?

473
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,920
I want to see the ambassador
and his wife, you know.

474
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,360
-Yeah, me too.
-Right?

475
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,040
We must have left
all our pictures in England.

476
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,680
[Tap] I'm so jealous.
I've never been to Europe.

477
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,640
If you wanna see
what Dino's parents would look like,

478
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,880
we can look for them
on the newspaper or the Internet.

479
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Isn't that right, Dino?

480
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,840
I'll go look for one.

481
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,200
[Pop] No, sit down.
Just stay here with us.

482
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,640
Let the servants get it.

483
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,720
Excuse me.

484
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Can you get the pictures
of Dino's parents?

485
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,360
-Yeah. We wanna see them.
-[Pop] Now, please?

486
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,840
[To] Do you think his dad is handsome?
I mean, Dino's good-looking.

487
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,600
-His dad's probably handsome, too.
-[Pop] Good point.

488
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,000
[Whan] Yeah. He must be handsome.

489
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
-[To] Here it is.
-[Whan] Wow.

490
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,080
-[Whan] Hey. No way.
-Is that him, Dino?

491
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,560
-[Pop] They don't look the same?
-[Whan] His dad is younger.

492
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,040
and his mom is still young, too.

493
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,960
[Tap] Mm-hmm.

494
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,280
I also don't think Dino
looks like his parents.

495
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
He looks more like…

496
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,360
Everyone says that,

497
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
but he actually looks more like
his grandfather at that age.

498
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,400
[To] I see.

499
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,240
[Tap] Oh, he looks like his grandpa.
His grandpa must be handsome.

500
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,240
[Whan] I agree.

501
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
Let's eat, then.

502
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,480
[Tap] Sounds good. I'm starving.

503
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,120
[Pop] Yeah, let's eat.

504
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,800
Where's the kitchen? Take me there.

505
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
[bell dings]

506
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,560
THE ART OF EATING

507
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,120
[all] Whoa.

508
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,120
-[Pop] Looks so good.
-[Whan] It's delicious.

509
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,640
Fuck, this is like
a Michelin-starred restaurant.

510
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,000
Your cook is awesome.

511
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,480
He must have been a chef
at a hotel before this.

512
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,600
-[Tap] I agree.
-Well, this is Mr. Dino's house.

513
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,240
Why would you think of the ordinary?

514
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
[To] That's true.

515
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,320
[Tap] Wow, it's so good.

516
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,640
-[To] Which one?
-[Tap] Try this.

517
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,120
-[To] This one?
-[Whan] Yeah, it's amazing.

518
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,160
Hey, everyone.

519
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,400
-Let's make a toast too.
-Okay, let's do it.

520
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,560
-[all] Cheers!
-[Tap] Cheers! Yay!

521
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
[Tap] Ugh!

522
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,520
What the hell is this?
There's no way that's whiskey.

523
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,680
I think you're too young to drink.
You're all underage.

524
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
[all laugh]

525
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
-Young?
-[all laughing]

526
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,080
Wait, who do you think you are

527
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,280
that you can tell us
what we can or can't drink?

528
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,200
Yeah.

529
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,960
I think servants shouldn't talk so much.

530
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
[To and Tap laugh]

531
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,280
[Pop] Whiskey!

532
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
He's still not moving.

533
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Yes.

534
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,920
Why is he being so annoying, man?

535
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,360
[To] He's so fucking dumb.

536
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,680
Dino is generous.

537
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,800
If it were me, I would tell my dad
to fire his ass.

538
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,360
[all laugh]

539
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm gonna stab you.

540
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,760
You should listen to Dino,
you work friend.

541
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,040
To is so cool, right?

542
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
When he's at home,
he's not like this at all.

543
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,560
-[Whan] Yeah.
-[Tap laughs]

544
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,560
[Pop] Is he a pussycat when he's at home?

545
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
[To] My dad is strict.

546
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
[Whan chuckles]

547
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,200
[Pop] Pour it for everyone.

548
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
For Dino as well?

549
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,160
[Tap, To, Whan, and Pop laugh]

550
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,920
[Pop] What the fuck you think? Of course.

551
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,560
[To] You don't serve the owner?

552
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Yes.

553
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,360
-[Tap] The aroma's good.
-Yeah, it is.

554
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
-[Pop] Raise a toast?
-Yeah.

555
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,400
-Come on.
-Yeah.

556
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,920
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

557
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,520
-Mm.
-Mm. It's good.

558
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
-It's good.
-[exhales]

559
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
-Straight to the heart.
-This is the life.

560
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,840
We do have whiskey and cigars.

561
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,280
But I still think we can have more fun.

562
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,000
That's why I brought some weed as well.

563
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,320
-[Pop] Woo-hoo!
-[To] Ooh, all right!

564
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,840
But this is my house.

565
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,000
[Pop] So what?

566
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,200
It's because this is your house
that we can do stuff like this.

567
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,520
Fuck yeah.

568
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What if my parents come back and smell it?

569
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
They'll get fucking high.

570
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,880
Dino, what are you scared of?

571
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,080
If the weed smells, let them deal with it.

572
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,240
-Exactly.
-That's right.

573
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
…them.

574
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,680
-But I--
-Hey, Whan is totally right.

575
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,800
What are servants here for anyway?

576
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,440
It's also not very often

577
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,600
that we can hang out like this
and have fun with no adults around.

578
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,760
[Pop] Yeah.

579
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,400
But I'm worried that my parents
might smell it.

580
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,560
[Pop] Hey. Your parents
won't believe them anyway.

581
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
You are the one who's in charge
what happens inside your house,

582
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,800
not your servants.

583
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,520
Anyway, if you tell them
not to say anything,

584
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
they'll act like
we were never here, right?

585
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,040
-[Whan] That's right.
-[Pop] That's true, yeah?

586
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
-What's up with you?
-Come on.

587
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,920
You all know that's what
we came here for, right?

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,040
-Yeah.
-We can go somewhere else.

589
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,120
-[Pop] Let's have some fun.
-Mm.

590
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,960
Just have some.

591
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,320
[To coughs]

592
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,320
-[Pop] It's good stuff.
-[Whan] It's a little strong,

593
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
but this smell is good.

594
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,800
[Tap] I'm gonna smoke it all.
It smells fucking good.

595
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,920
[Dino coughs]

596
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,920
[Pop] Look at him.

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,800
-[Pop] Come on.
-[Tap] Are you all right?

598
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,239
I want to have you guys
come over to my house next time,

599
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,920
but I can't invite you anymore
now that I've experienced Dino's house.

600
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,840
-[Pop] Hey.
-[To] Huh?

601
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,400
You tried to compare your house
to Dino's house?

602
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,000
-Geez. I won't dare anymore.
-[Pop] Right?

603
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,600
Hey, it's okay.

604
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,960
[Pop] Come on, come on.

605
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,639
[cutlery clattering]

606
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,880
-[Tap] To, have some veggies.
-[Pop] I think the pork ribs…

607
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,040
-I got it on my plate.
-It's good to have it with red wine.

608
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,280
-[Tap] Hey, I want some.
-[Whan] Yeah, me too. I want some.

609
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,440
[Pop] Get the red wine.

610
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
Uh, you've all had too much already.

611
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,120
[Pop] Whatever. Shut up.

612
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,679
Dino. Your servants are ruining the party.

613
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,120
[Tap giggles]

614
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,440
[Dino] He's probably just worried.

615
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,639
We've all had so much already.

616
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,120
I mean, what if we throw up?

617
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
-Just wipe it.
-[Pop] Who cares if we throw up?

618
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
Having pork ribs…

619
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,960
-with red wine is a fucking work of art.
-[To] Yeah.

620
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,680
Come on, go get it.

621
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
[Dino] Just get it.

622
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,400
-[Pop] My glass is getting dusty now.
-[Dino's mom] It's all right.

623
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,960
[Tap] I want red wine.

624
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,840
-[Tap] I want to have red wine.
-[To] I want to have red wine.

625
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400
-[Pop] Hey.
-I'll go get it.

626
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,760
[Pop] You should be as obedient as she is.

627
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,680
[Tap] Yeah.

628
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,360
[Pop] Look at this mug face.
Are you working at a casino?

629
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,840
Wine, miss.
[gasps]

630
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
-[Whan gasps] Shit.
-[To] Hey.

631
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,720
This is brand new.

632
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,760
[Pop] What the fuck.

633
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,960
Hey, calm down now.

634
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,080
[Pop] Your maid obviously did it
on purpose.

635
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,040
You, you were all too young to drink.

636
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,240
[Pop] Stop talking, man.

637
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,520
Okay, then.

638
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,680
-Let's get out of here
-But they were…

639
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
Okay, let them clean this room.

640
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,280
It's so annoying. Let's go, guys.

641
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,840
[scoffs]
Fuck me.

642
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm being considerate of my host or else,
I would punch him in the face.

643
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Son…

644
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,640
IS THIS FUN ENOUGH?

645
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,960
This sucks!

646
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,920
The wine's not coming off.

647
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,440
She needs to buy me a new one.

648
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,240
[door closes]

649
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,800
I'll buy you a new one.

650
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,040
They're getting on my nerves.

651
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,120
[Tap] Hey.

652
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,480
Look, we only get to hang out as a group
every once in a while, you guys, come on.

653
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,880
We're alone. Those losers are gone.

654
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,120
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

655
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,120
How about we do
something crazy and fun, yeah?

656
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,680
[To] Tap, you're scaring me.

657
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
[Tap and Whan laugh]

658
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,880
Hey, do you have anything else
besides golf, Dino?

659
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,400
Is this fun enough for you?

660
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,080
-Fuck!
-Hell, yeah.

661
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,760
-[To] Fuck!
-[Pop] What the hell.

662
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey, that's something do to.

663
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,360
How about this?

664
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,480
Fuck, what?

665
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,520
[Pop] I'll only load one bullet

666
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
and whoever gets shot
will win the entire pot.

667
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,560
Everyone, 200,000 baht,

668
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,360
at you.

669

[gun cocks]

670
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,120
[Pop] Are you playing?

671
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,400
Fuck, no way.
What if I shoot myself and die?

672
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,560
-Yeah.
-[giggles]

673
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
Just shoot your arm.

674
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,800
[Pop] Whan, what do you want again?

675
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,800
Chanel? You can buy six handbags.

676
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
What do you say?

677
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
Fuck. Fine. 200,000. Let's go.

678
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
You?

679
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Yeah, let's go.

680
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,160
And you?

681
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,120
[Tap] Yeah, I'll do it too.

682
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,080
-Nanno?
-Do you accept checks?

683
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,520
Yeah.

684
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
Dino, what about you?

685
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,320
I'll do it.

686
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,960
Cool. Then, I'll start first.

687
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,720
[Tap] Fuck. He's really doing it.

That was scary.

692
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,240
It's your turn.

693
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
[Tap] To, do it. It's 1.2 million baht.

694
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,960
-It's my turn already?
-[Tap] Yeah.

695
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,960
-Do it.
-[Tap] It's 1.2 million.

696
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Do it.

697
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,120

-You suck.
-Go get it.

702
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,120
Wait and see. With my luck, I'll get it.

703
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,840
-[all] New boobs. New boobs. New boobs.

[laughing]

709
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,240
All right, my turn.

710
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,080
-You're brave.
-Six Chanel bags for you.

711
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,240
Come on. Do it.

712
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,280
[To and Pop] Six bags. Six bags. Six bags.

[To and Pop laugh]

715
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,760
No Chanel bags for you, girlfriend.
[laughs]

716
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,120
Fuck, it's Nanno's turn.

-[Pop] Huh?
-[Tap] Come on!

-Here.
-[To] Are you fucking crazy?

721
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
Dino's the last person.

722
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,320
I think our host has a chance
to win it all, you guys.

723
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,640
End the game.

724
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,800
[To] Yeah, do it.

725
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,480
[all] Dino! Dino! Dino!

726
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Wait.

727
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,720
I think that's too easy.

728
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,920
-That's right, put it in your mouth.
-[Whan] Hey! Hey! Hey!

729
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,160
-What the fuck did you stop him?
-[shouting] Because I wanted to!

730
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,800
I can't take your behavior anymore!

731
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,440
What are you guys even doing?

732
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Huh?

733
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,080
What are you doing?

734
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,120
What the hell!

735
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Do you know how much money
your parents spend in order to raise you?

736
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,520
Do you know how hard it was?

737
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,560
Have you ever even thought about that?

738
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,520
Have that even occurred to you?

739
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,240
And what are you guys even gambling on?

740
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,000
You're betting your lives for money?

741
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
The fuck are you thinking, huh?

742
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,800
To throw your life for money,
what a waste.

743
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm speaking to you as…

744
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
a father,

745
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,960
not because I'm older
or more mature than you.

746
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,360
I'm the father of the person you--

[Dino's mom screams]

753
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,400
Why did you do this?

754
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,120
How can you do this?

755
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,240
-What are you doing?
-Don't shoot! Calm down!

756
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,000
-It's the last bullet! Don't shoot!
-Whan, don't be scared now.

757
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,280
She wouldn't dare to shoot
anyone of us here

758
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,320
because she can't afford to pay
our hospital bills.

Do you really think the gun is loaded?

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,200
Is she dead?

768
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,480
Pop, this is all your fault.

769
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,520
Fuck. What should I do?

770
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,240
[Nanno] It's not that hard.

771
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,560
Just do what you've always done.

Dad, Mom.

775
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,240
How was Dhamma Camp, Dino?

776
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,200
So, did you meditate a long time?

777
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,280
No, Mom.

778
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,040

to pack your mosquito repellant.

I'm sorry.

781
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Hey, Pop, you should give more
than everyone else.

782
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,160
I'm totally broke, man.

783
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,280
Dino, you don't have to. It wasn't you.

784
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,160
You're the boss. You can clear things
up for us. Don't worry.

This should be enough to keep shut.

787
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,280
This includes compensation
to pay all of your hospital bills.

788
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,240
[Dino] Don't… Don't tell anyone.

If you're going to another session
of Dhamma Camp,

792
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,480
don't forget to tell us.

793
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,920
What about you?

794
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,680
What do you think money can buy?

795
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,480

[somber music playing]

797
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,280
My opinion, money is the most
important thing in the whole world.

798
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,680
If you don't have money,
you can't really do anything at all.

799
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
I hope I have never have to live
without it. I mean… Fuck that.

800
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
I don't know why I should live
without money. I deserve it.

801
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,080
Who wants to do that?

802
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,280
Oh… I think I'd be so unhappy.

803
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,480
If I saw some new clothes that I like,
but I didn't have money to buy them,

804
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,680
even just thinking about it
doesn't feel good.

805
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,520
No, no, no. That's a no-no.

806
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,240
If I were to imagine myself as poor,

807
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,080
I can't think
of what that would be right now.

808
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,280
Even now, I get stressed.

809
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,160
When I only have 2,000 baht
in my wallet, I feel so poor.

810
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,960
It can pretty much buy everything.

811
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,880
We can even buy people with money.

812
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,160
I came up with a project.

813
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,640
When I grow up,
I want to contribute to society.

814
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,600
I will buy all of this land.
I'll build a temple.

815
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,880
I'm going to invite monks
and goddesses to pray all day.

816
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,640
I'll invite poor people and then,

817
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,440
I'll give the poor people
rice, rice, rice.

818
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,000
so they will never go hungry again
in their lifetime.

819
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,200
