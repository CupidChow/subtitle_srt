6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,400
It's value is not only based on the price,

but also on a person's attachment to it.

…that make up some great story.

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
[shop owner] It was made in the '60s.

It was cheap then.

It's a lot more expensive now, though.

He had a business trip abroad.

because we don't want any trouble

It causes lots of problems.

He's aware of that.

45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,240
That's why he wanted to give you this.

Okay. Let's continue on.

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,520
We just gotta find his.

171
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,560
Ah, see.

172
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,200
This shows all the camera feeds in here.

173
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
How did you do that?

174
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,840
I just put in the password.

175
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,360
-What's the password?
-Hey.

176
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
I'm not gonna reveal

177
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
all my secrets to you.

178
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,480
Ah.

179
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,600
That camera up there

180
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
only covers

181
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
this area right here.

182
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,800
And this other camera

183
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
only goes to there.

184
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,160
So the blind spot is…

185
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,760
I can't believe he paid so much money
for this painting.

186
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,640
I think people pay more attention
to quantity than to detail.

187
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,599
[Nanno grunts]

188
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,960
There's so many flowers.

189
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
[announcer] Attention.

190
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,640
A painting has been stolen
from the art exhibition.

191
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,440
A painting has been stolen
from the art exhibition.

192
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,040
You all heard him.

193
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,520
Bags on the table, right now.

194
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll personally go
through every single one of you.

195
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,520
It was you, right?

196
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
[suspenseful music]

197
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,680
Are you helping your friend

198
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,280
hide something?

199
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,360
[all laughing]

200
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
[TK] Isn't nice, huh?

201
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
[Nanno] No way.

202
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
I hate flowers.

203
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,200
What are some other things
that you've stolen?

204
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
[TK chuckles]

205
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,600
[TK] Does this camera still work?

206
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,760
Doesn't this cat belong
to that store owner?

207
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,160
[Nanno] Well, it's my cat now.

208
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,800
And these…

209
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Audrey Hepburn wore them
in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

210
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,880
That one is from a store in Europe.

211
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,480
[TK] Does that really belong
to Charlie Chaplin?

212
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,240
[Nanno] This one is a limited edition.

213
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
[TK] Ooh.

214
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
And this diamond?

215
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,560
[Nanno] I stole that from my last school.

216
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
Where do you store all your stuff, then?

217
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
Mm.

218
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,360
In a warehouse that was stolen.

219
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,280
No. I'm kidding.

220
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,120
[laughs]

221
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,560
How about you?
Where do you keep your stuff?

222
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
Hmm…

223
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,680
Are you here alone?

224
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,480
Hmm…

225
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,400
You have a lot of stuff.

226
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,800
That's quite impressive.

227
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,840
Oh, come on.

228
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Your stuff fills a warehouse.

229
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Who is this?

230
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,480
My father.

231
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
And is he…

232
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,040
Alive.

233
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
But he…

234
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,720
might as well be dead. He's never around.

235
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,640
Hey, Nanno.

236
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,640
Why do you steal stuff?

237
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,160
I have no reason.

238
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,480
I like it.

239
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,440
It's a fun thing to do.

240
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,800
What do you love to steal the most?

241
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
Don't know.

242
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,480
I take things that people say
are hard to steal.

243
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,040
How about you?

244
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,520
Hmm. I do it for fun as well.

245
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,440
[sniffs]
Wrong.

246
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,200
You cannot be a good thief
unless you learn to lie, okay?

247
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
And what does that mean?

248
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,160
[phone beeps]

249
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Nanno.

250
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,800
Everyone says a genius
stole that painting.

251
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,280
How was it genius?

252
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,400
All I really did was look for the obvious.

253
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,400
I want to thank you.

254
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
What do you mean, "thank you"?

255
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
For being a good friend.

256
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
A friend?

257
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,640
Mm-hm.

258
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,840
I've…

259
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
never had a friend before.

260
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,920
Actually, I have no one.

261
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, listen--

262
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,440
[TK] Do me a favor.

263
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,840
Promise me that you won't leave.

264
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
What makes you think I'll go away?

265
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Well, I…

266
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,560
I have no idea.

267
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
I just feel,

268
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,440
like, maybe once

269
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,760
you finished here or you're…

270
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,440
done having fun, you'll leave.

271
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,360
The thing is, I really…

272
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,680
like being with you.

273
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,560
Stay here with me.

274
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,120
Mm-hm.

275
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Promise?

276
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's not make any promises.

277
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
I mean, I'm here right now.

278
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,560
Aren't I? I'm not going anywhere.

279
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,680
We don't have to keep them for real.

280
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,600
But hey make us feel better.

281
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
Well, I…

282
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,680
think I like…

283
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
being with

284
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,320
you too.

285
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,920
But I…

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,960
But what's that?

287
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,280
Please let go of my hand.

288
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Oh.

289
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,160
[chuckles]

290
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
I think that I can bring
your father back, TK.

291
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,120
In the past,

292
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,880
I always stole small things.

293
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,680
Why don't we go for something bigger?

294
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,520
What are you saying?

295
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,120
Every year, new students enroll.

296
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
And as you've experienced yourself,

297
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,640
it's not very easy
to get into this school.

298
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,800
Will you please help us out?
Please, Principal?

299
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,520
[TK] He uses that money

300
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,400
to fix up the school, right?

301
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,720
But why don't we really think about it.

302
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,760
Ever since you moved here,

303
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,800
has anything really changed

304
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,000
or improved at all?

305
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,960
[Nanno] Apart from the principal

306
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,160
who just gets richer,

307
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,320
and richer?

308
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,640
So you're going to steal his money, then?

309
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
It isn't his money, you know.

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
It's the money, you can say,
he stole from the students.

311
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,400
Okay, so what's your plan?

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
[Nanno] In his office,

313
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,120
there's a poster right above his desk.

314
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,800
And behind that poster,

315
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,280
there is a hidden safe.

316
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,800
We need to find a way to get it open.

317
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,600
For this plan to work,

318
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,520
we need to study up.

319
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
[suspenseful music]

320
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,760
The police have been following me all day.

321
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
Shall we just give up the plan?

322
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,560
I think our plan is very well crafted.

323
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
[TK] But what if we get caught?

324
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,040
What about that, Nanno?

325
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,960
So, what then?

326
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
It's okay.

327
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,440
I can just go do it alone.

328
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,480
-[TK] Hold on. Wait, Nanno.
-[Nanno] Leave me alone.

329
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,320
We're not doing it now.

330
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm backing out of this for you.
I don't want…

331
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,760
you to get caught.

332
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,720
Yeah, well, I'm not afraid.
You can't stop me.

333
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Stop it.

334
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,200
I'll do it. But…

335
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,040
if you do get caught…

336
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,960
blame everything on me.

337
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,480
Tell them I was the one

who talked you into it.

339
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,400
-Why?
-What'd you say?

340
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,920
What about the promise that we made?

341
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
If it's about that then…

342
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,520
I'll break it for you.

343
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,160
So promise me.

344
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,360
Promise me?

345
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,200
Promise me, Nanno.

346
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,960
[Nanno] We will go with the original plan.

[whispers]
I'm ready, Nanno.

350
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,640
Are you sure that you wanna go in alone?

351
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm sure.

352
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,600
You go first.

353
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,440
[door lock beeps open]

354
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,200
You're good to go.

355
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,840
I found it, Nanno.

356
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,760
-Hey, Nanno, keep an eye out.
-[Nanno] Yeah.

357
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,640
[safe clicks]

358
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,480
I found the documents.

359
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,560
[principal] Wait,
let me talk to the kid alone.

360
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Please, can you give us some privacy?

361
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,840
-Yes, sir. Go ahead.
-[principal] Okay. Thank you.

362
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,200
Everyone, out.

363
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,560
[principal] There is a way
we can make this go away.

364
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,720
Your father is a smart man and will know

365
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,760
the best way to handle this.

366
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,560
I've already told him

367
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
all about what you've been
up to here tonight.

368
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
[sighs]

369
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,880
You can't steal my father's money
this time, understand?

370
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Even though I don't have
the documents anymore…

371
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,040
I have the footage from your cameras.

372
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Imagine if it got out.

373
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,040
[door opens]

374
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,760
She didn't do anything.

375
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,960
Actually,

376
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,240
she has everything to do with this.

377
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,080
[Nanno] All the footage

378
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,640
was saved on this computer.

379
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,320
[principal] She…

380
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,120
deserves to be here at our school.

[door opens]

382
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
[police] Principal,
there's a parent here to see you.

383
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,560
[principal] Then let him in.

384
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
[Nanno] I think that I can bring
your father back, TK.

385
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
-Hmm.
-[TK sighs]

[butler] I know…

387
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,400
some unruly behavior occurred.

388
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,360
Mm.

389
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,240
And that's why my boss
has a small gift for you

390
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,239
to make up for all the troubles
you went through.

391
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,280
He will also gladly

392
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,679
pay back

393
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
for any of the damage
of this school's property.

You tell my dad

397
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,159
that money

398
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,920
can't fix everything.

399
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,840
-I won't be seeing you again.
-[principal] Don't you dare do that!

-[police] Are you okay?

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,880
-Why should I?
-[principal] Officers, take him away.

I don't wanna see you here again.

00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,320
[Dad] Are you that surprised
to see your own father?

408
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Why are you here?

409
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,600
[Dad sighs]
You're mean, just like your mother.

410
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,120
I don't want you here.

411
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,640
I don't want your money.

412
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,160
I can survive all by myself.

413
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,120
[Dad] Well, I was just stopping by.

414
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,160
I'll leave soon. Son, are you okay?

415
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,680
Well, then. Take care, son.

[Nanno] You know what our problem is?

00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,960
We don't really appreciate what we have

your dad back,

I saw I had to take him away first.

Mm-hm.

427
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,880
I know why you did what you did.

428
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,200
What if there's something
I don't wanna lose?
