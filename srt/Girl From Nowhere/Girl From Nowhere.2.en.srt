we apologize.

You skipped practice.

There's a new girl… in room B.

-Room B?
-Is she hot?

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Would I be telling you if she wasn't hot?

They… they skipped
their basketball practice.

I'm sorry for the noise, miss.

Don't talk to them, Nanno.

[Nanno] Do you like them?

They're nice to look at,

58
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,480
but they have way too many fans.

So why did you skip practice, huh?

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,920
-[Taew] It's not like that.
-Everyone is getting us to get to her.

163
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,320
[school bell ringing]

164
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
[Taew] Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

165
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,240
Look.

166
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,960
Good morning, Taew and I-Tim.

167
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
[Taew] Hi there!

168
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,240
Serves him right. There he goes.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,760
[Taew] Nanno, do you like him at all?

170
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,800
How about you? Do you like someone?

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,920
I used to. No, not anymore.
Guys will always let you down.

172
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,600
[Nanno] Yeah, I agree.

173
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
Hmm…

174
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,280
It is a nice flower, though.

175
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
You were not nice to him at all.

176
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,840
If you like it so much, you can have it.

177
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Keep it. It's all yours, okay.

178
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,640
I hate flowers.

179
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
You do? Why is that?

180
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,080
I don't know. I just do.

181
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
[scoffs]

182
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,720
SHE'S SO PRETENTIOUS.

183
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,280
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,600
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM,
YET SHE STILL FLIRTS WITH HIM.

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
[foreboding music]

186
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM,
YET SHE STILL FLIRTS WITH HIM.

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,680
SHOULD WE USE
THE WORD "SLUTTY" INSTEAD?

188
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,440
SHE PROBABLY WANTS ALL THREE OF THEM.

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,240
DON'T INSULT MY NANNO.

190
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
OH, DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH HER?
HOW MUCH?

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I DON'T PAY FOR SEX.
SHE'S WORTH 4,000 BAHT, I GUESS.

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,120
CAN I ASK FOR A DISCOUNT?

193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,840
JUST 500 BAHT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR HER.

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,880
YOU CAN GET HER FOR FREE. I HEARD
EVERYONE HAD SEX WITH HER ALREADY.

195
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
-[bell rings]
-[Taew] What's up?

196
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,520
[I-Tim] There is a new café.

197
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,840
-Let's go.
-Okay.

198
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah. Let's go.
[chuckles]

199
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
[Taew] Nanno, are you coming with us?

200
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
-[Nanno] Yeah.
-[Taew] Great.

201
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
[Neung] Taew. Hey.

202
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,600
What's up?

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
I have a test and I don't know anything.

204
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,000
[sigh]

205
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,600
I know you know nothing.
You never study.

206
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
I do the best I can. I promise.

207
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,840
All right. Sit down.

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
You can go ahead.

210
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,080
It's fine. We'll wait for you.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Uh-huh.

212
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,360
-Come on, hurry.
-Okay, okay.

213
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm curious. How is playing basketball
make you any smarter, huh?

214
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay, yeah.

215
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,280
You got it now?

216
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,280
-No.
-[both laugh]

217
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Well, here. Look, this one, right?

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,160
The median is this.

219
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,640
After this… Let me jot it down for you.

220
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,160
[Neung] Sure.

221
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,640
If you can do that,
then you will know the method.

222
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,000
You want to divide by 1,000 people, right?

223
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
Try to use this formula.

224
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,760
[Taew] It will be 3x multiplied
by 3y plus 32.

225
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,640
Remember to always do it this way.
It'll be much easier.

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,680
Now, if you take a look right here, you…

227
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
[somber music]

228
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,120
Hey, Taew, you okay?

229
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,040
-[Neung] Taew!
-[I-Tim] Taew.

230
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Wait.

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,400
[Taew sobbing]

232
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,600
[whimpers]

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
[crying]

234
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,640
[crying continues]

[crying continues]

236
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Do you still like that boy?

237
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
[sobs]

238
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,560
[I-Tim] I thought
you didn't like him anymore.

239
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,560
[whimpers]

240
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,000
[I-Tim] I mean, really,
what's so great about him?

241
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
[whimpers]

242
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,320
He's stupid. Come on, Taew.

243

[sobbing]

244

[sobbing continues]

245
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,960
He's not a stupid guy.
He's just not good at Math.

246
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,280
[sniffles]

247
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,400
I just don't know why I love him.

[sobbing]

249
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,240
-You, okay?
-[Taew wails]

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,040
[Taew] Don't talk to me.
Go away. I just want to cry.

251
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,920
[sobbing]

252
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,240
Okay. I'll go then.

253
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,600
Come outside
when you're done though, okay?

[I-Tim] Taew.

258
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,560
Let's go to the concert.

259
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,000
[foreboding music]

260
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
Hmm.

261
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Okay.

262
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,040
I wanted to see that band for a while now.

263

[upbeat music]

[exhales]

266
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,200
[Neung] How can you drink so much?

267
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
Come on.

268
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,600
One more?

269
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
[Neung] Oh.

270
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,920
Hey, come with me.

271
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,520
We'll be back.

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,320
Taew, why is Nanno
not getting drunk at all?

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,640
-The guys will get hammered before she--
-Shh.

274
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
Why don't you just shout it to her face?

275
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
[Neung] One more?

276
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,360
I think we need a recipe.

277
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,760
Why don't we mix this,
beer, punch, and some vodka.

278
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,960
-[Neung] Wanna try it?
-[Hok] That's right.

279
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,080
Where did you get that?

280
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,680
They're my mom's.
That will really mess her up.

281
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
How many should we use?

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,080
Let's use a couple.

283
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,480
-Should we add them?
-Yeah, let's add them.

284
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,120
-[rattles]
-[Taew] No, give them to me.

285
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,840
Don't drop them be careful.

286
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,280
[Hok] It's empty.

287
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,120
Snacks are here.

288
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,280
Let's drink some more.

-Refill.
-[Hok] Okay!

-Nanno, give me the glass.
-Here.

[Hok] On the rocks.

[Taew] Five pills?
I thought we were using two.

294
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
Wanna make sure it works.

295
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,960
-Why do you like drinking?
-[Neung] I don't know.

296
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,880
-Here. Everyone, refill your glass.
-[Neung] Yeah.

297
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
-[Taew] Come on.
-[I-Tim] Cheers.

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
[Taew] Let's do this.

299
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,480
I want to drink this one with Nanno.

300
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,640
-Yeah.
-[all] Great!

Chug it.

Chug it! Chug it!

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,320
- [Hok] Whoa! Wow! Chug it!
- [Neung] Chug it!

307

-[Neung] One more?
-[glasses clink]

308
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,080
-[Taew] Chug it.
-Yes.

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,400
-[male friend] Oh, yeah.
-[Taew, Hok, Neung, male friend] Chug it!

-Wait.
-[Neung] Wait.

Where are you taking her?
Come on. Leave her.

316
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
We want to watch.

317

[Neung] I want to check out, too.

318

Are you insane?
We don't want to see anything.

You can go anywhere, just not here.

320

[Nanno] You look kind of sick today.

Let me give you a checkup.

You don't seem sick at all to me.

But…

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,680
the wound looks so bad.

494
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,840
What have you been up to?

495
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Why don't you tell me?

[Nanno chuckles]

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
she doesn't disappear.

-[Taew] Are you crazy?

Do you think this girl
is lying to all of us?

505
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,400
[Neung] So what do you want us to do?
Go ahead and kill another person?

506
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,120
Well, you should've thought
of that before.

She knows all of us.

508

She knows this place.
She knows the party last night.

509
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,160
And she knows that we were burying a body.

510
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,680
[Taew] And she said
she wanted to party here.

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
Could it be her twin?

512

Well, she said she is Nanno.

I don't want to be involved
in this anymore.

If you want to kill one more person…

go for it.
