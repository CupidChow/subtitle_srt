can bring someone
as their very own personal guest.

Don't forget that beauty
is your most valuable commodity.

NUMBER 1, GADE PIMNAPA

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
Those are the twins,

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
they are Cherry and Lilly.

170
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,720
They are in second and third place.

171
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
And those girls are named Kim and Fah.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
They are fifth and seventh.

173
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,920
Gade is smart, friendly, and beautiful.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Wow, look.

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,040
She walks just like a swan.

176
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,400
But Ying, wouldn't you like to be
number one?

177
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,480
I think you're as beautiful as Gade.

For me,

181
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,080
being in the top ten is a great honor.

182
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't know
if I could be the Shining Star.

183
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
I've not thought about it.

184
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,480
No one can be Gade.

185
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,120
Like I told you before.
I don't really wanna be the Shining Star.

[Nanno] Ying? Ying.

You don't know about that.

Nanno.

189
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
Actually, you're quite pretty too.

Why don't you go look at your ranking
on your app, you wanna?

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,080
Hmm, I don't think so.

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,160
I would be happy even if I was last.

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,520
Hmm. Let's just take a look.

than Ying did.

It's only temporary.

Once your pimple goes away,
you'll be in the top ten again.

[student 1]
Why would you let yourself get a pimple?

230
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,360
I haven't seen you with one before.

231
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,240
[student 3] No. Stop.
It will get worse if you keep touching it.

232
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,120
You must have been eating chocolates.
They can give you lots of pimples.

You can't leave it like that.

I know of a good clinic. Should we go?

Yeah, why don't you have
a look at your face?

with me tomorrow, if you want.

[Nanno]
Don't worry about it. She's with me.

Come join me, Princess 11.

342

No, that's okay.

343
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,560
How about I push you?

Mm.

345

Ying, you are so nice.

Thank you, Ying.

347
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,160
It really is a shame.

348
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I wish that we were in the top ten
together finally.

What can I do?

350
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,680
This is all I can do for now.

351
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Don't give up just yet, Ying.

352
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
There might be a way to get back in.

If you're not this pretty,

354

there may be a way to make
the other girls ugly.

Have you heard what happened?

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Put on some blush.

Hey, listen.

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,040
Have you heard what happened? Okay.

-About what?
-It's Ying.

375
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,960
She's back in the top ten again, you know.

[Lilly] Oh, yeah. I heard.
We all heard. It's true.

Nanno fell off the swing.

It's true. She fell off the swing.

[Fah] Every year,
as the award day approaches,

380
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,560
things like this happen.

381
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,400
Yeah, remember that shitty thing
that happened to Ann?

-Ann?
-Uh-huh.

383
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,040
The day right before the ceremony,

384
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,080
she dropped from 2nd to 40th place.

385
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,680
Yeah, that did happen.

[Kim] Actually, Gade, I do pity Ying.

391
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,680
She's been in tenth place forever.

392
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I feel bad for her.

393
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,360
You can't blame her for it, though.

394
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,880
In Ying's case,

395
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,640
blame it on her mother.

396
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,920
[girls] Ooh!

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,000

-[Lilly] I want carrot cake.

[Kim] Carrot cake again?

403
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
[Fah] I want some orange juice.

404
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,720
[Kim] That sounds good.

405
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,760
In Ying's case,

406
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,400
blame it on her mother.

407
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,200
Blame it on her mother.

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,800

Stop it, Cherry. Go to the nurse.

Hello, it's me, Gade.

Today, I will review a new cream.

It really works.

Oh, Nanno. You frightened me.

00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,480
You've been busy these days, haven't you?

433
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,080
Since it's so close to naming
the Shining Star,

434
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,840
I think you should be careful.

Of course, yeah.

[Ying] What are you doing here?

441
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,640
Right now,

442
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,960
our school's beauty standard has dropped.

Even with this face,

I'm still in third place.

You

are a role model

They're all trying to copy you.

Are you here to steal
my crown, then, Nanno?

[Nanno chuckles]

454
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,400
Being the Shining Star
is not important to me.

But it sure is to someone like you.

Are you sure you've already won?

For you to leave.

[Nanno] Mm. Ying. Don't forget.

463

Believe in your beauty

who can be the Shining Star?

[Ying] Who even is she?

497
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,360
She doesn't go to our school.

498
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,480
No matter what,
the Shining Star belongs to me.

Young lady, we must have faith
in our friend's beauty as well.

-Didn't she use to be fat?
-[Chompoo] …for giving me…

506

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,640
that beauty is your value.

515
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,800
Let's thank our beauty for what it does.

516
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,800
To all of you out there,

517
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,160
you're all beautiful

518
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,800
and don't you ever forget.
