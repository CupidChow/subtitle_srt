[Nanno] It's finally graduation day.

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,400
Everyone is sad about leaving

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,920
as if everything in their life
is about to end

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,800
and they're not ready to start
the next phase of their life.

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,519
Many believe that after this,
everything will become part of the past.

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,480
We don't ever want to forget
all those great memories we made.

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,240
However, this might not be the end,

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,880
but just the beginning,

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,760
when all the ugly truths from our past
will be on earth.

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
So, be careful.

12

What, you called her an asshole, huh?

to call an angel such a foul name?

Normally, he would play rock music.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
But once he saw Fong clapping for him,

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,440
he would only play love songs. Ha-ha!

showing ownership.

[Wit] He's possessive.

Captain Thap is possessive.

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,800
As of now, our Fong has quit
her promising sales job,

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,960
and is taking care of Captain Thap 24/7.

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
The moment I knew that,

94
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,920
I was so jealous that I cried my eyes out.

95

Okay, everybody. Raise your glasses.

[Wit] No, you got fucked.

160
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
[Shorty] Hello, everyone.

161
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,320
We're now at the spot where we buried
our time capsule 12 years ago.

162
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
We've been digging for a while,

163
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,880
but we still haven't found the chest.

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,040
[Shorty] Hey. Hey, what's that smell?

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
[Meng] That really stinks.

166
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,000
-[Meng] Whoa, there are worms.
-[Shorty] Holy shit! Worms.

167
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680
[Bell] Gross.

168
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
-Shit, come on. Hurry. Let's get it…
-So many worms.

169
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
-[Meng grunts]
-[Shorty] Shit.

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,840
-[Meng] I got it.
-Come here.

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
-Hey, friends.
-Yes.

172
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
Right now, we've got the time capsule box
that we buried 12 years ago.

173
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
-Yeah.
-Come on.

174
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,520
[Meng] It's so fucking exhausting.

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,680
Right now, we're going to carry this chest
into the reunion and open it.

176
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,120
[crowd applauding]

177
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,080
[Bell] What? Oh, my god.

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,360
[Shorty] Wit, you're such a jerk.
You should've helped.

179
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Why didn't you come and help, asshole?

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
-[Chai] Meng, did you step on shit?
-[Meng] Wit, open it.

181
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,400
-[Meng] Ew.
-[Wit clears throat]

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,520
[Proud] Just open it.

183
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,920
[Shorty] Just do it.
Come on, let's open it.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
[Wit] This key…

185
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,640
I've been keeping it safe
for 12 years now. Twelve long years.

186
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
Judging from your faces…

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
I should open it right away, huh?

188
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,640
-[Meng] Yeah, just open it.
-[all] Yeah.

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
[Wit] I just wanted it to be a bit
ceremonial.

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,680
-[Shorty] Hurry up.
-[Bell giggles]

191
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,400
[Wit] Shit!

192
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,320
-[Shorty] What the fuck?
-[Chai] What is it?

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,560
It's so rusted.

194
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,040
-[Chai] Hurry up.
-[Shorty] Smash it.

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
-[Wit] Smash?
-[Shorty] Yeah.

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,320
Just smash it.

197
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,720
Chai, come here and do it.

198
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Jeez, don't just stand there
flexing your muscles.

199
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,080
-All right.
-I'll handle it.

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
[Meng] Hey.

201
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,200
[people cheering, applauding]

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,720
-[Wit] That's my man. Good job, Chai.
-[Chai] You got it.

203
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
[Wit groans]

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
-[Meng] Oh, shit.

206
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,160
[Kai] It's not worth it.

207
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,040
[crowd] Ooh.

208
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,280
Look. Check this out. Guess whose it is.

209
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh, it's mine.
[chuckles]

210
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
[Bell] It's so old.

211
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,920
Thank you so much, everyone,
for signing this flag

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
and being here tonight.

213
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,720
I'm really grateful for you.

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,960
[Kai and Meng] Yeah.

215
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
-[Shorty] Cool.
-[Wit] Yeah! [chuckles]

216

[camera shutter clicks faster]

219
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Hey.

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
I don't even have to say who buried this.

221
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
They even buried their letters together.

222
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,160
That's so gross. Am I right, folks?

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,120
[Meng] Yeah.

224
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,160
All right, I'm going to need
Thap and Fong to come up,

225
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,000
and read their love letters for us, okay?

[crowd applauding]

227
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,080
[Thap] Wait. Hold on.
That's private stuff.

228
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,080
[Wit] Come on. We're all friends here.

229
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,000
-[Shorty] Yeah.
-[Wit] Hurry. Come here.

230
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,920
-[Shorty] Open it.
-[Meng] Yeah.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
-[Meng] Come on.
-[Kai] Hurry up.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,240
-[Kai] Let's go.
-[Wit] Read them.

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,640
[all] Read them! Read them! Read them!

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
[Thap] All right. Okay. Fuck you.

235
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
[Wit] Yeah. No need to be nervous.
We're all friends.

236
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
-[Meng] Yeah.
-[Wit] Are you thirsty?

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,680
[Wit] It seems like he's thirsty.
Hey, you. Get him a drink.

238
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
[Wit] Okay, here you go, Captain.

239
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
[Wit] Thank you.

240
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,400
[Wit] Read it already. People are waiting.

241
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,400
Oh, okay.

242
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeah.

243

"I promise I won't ever leave you, Fong.

244
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Once I become a pilot,

245
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
will you please marry me?"

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
[crowd] Ooh!

247
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
[Bell] Not bad at all.

248
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
Okay, I'm done.

249
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
-Is that it?
-That's it.

250
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
Okay, applause.

Very nice. Very nice.

253
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,240
[Thap] Fong, what's wrong?

254
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
You seem quiet.

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,320
We can go home first if you want.

256
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,200
[Thap] I don't want our friends
to see us like this.

257
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,800
About the party…

258
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,840
There's no need to worry.

259
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,000
[Thap] You've been like this
for almost a week.

260
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,720
Tell me what you're thinking.

261
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
What about you?

262
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
Is there something you wanna tell me?

263
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
Fong, what do you want me to say?

264
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I don't know.

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm a woman.

266
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
I have a gut feeling.

267
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,720
[Thap] About what?

268
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,760
What did I do?

269
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't let me catch you
red-handed, pathetic.

270
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,080
How many times have we talked about this?

271
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes, Thap. How many?

272
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,240
Just ask yourself.

273
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
[sighs]

274
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
Okay. Captain Thap
has read his letter for us.

275
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Now…

276
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,720
In order to make it fair,

277
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,760
-our angelic Fong has to read hers, too.
-[crowd cheering]

278
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,320
What's the sticker on the cover?

279
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,520
"Together, we live.
Leave me, you're dead."

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
-[Wit] Wow.
-[crowd] Ooh!

281
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,560
[Chai] Hey.

282
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Let Thap read it to everyone.

283
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
-[Fong] Here.
-Okay.

284
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,600
"My dearest Thap.

285
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,040
I don't know how long it will take
until you read this letter.

286
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,400
I just want to thank you
for taking care of me,

287
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,480
and for always
forgiving me when I'm wrong.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
[Thap] I just want to tell you that

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,520
if I didn't have you,
I don't know how my life would be,

290
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,680
and I don't want to know.

291
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,440
So, I've decided
to have you here with me forever,

292
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
and I'll do my best to take care of you.

293
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
I won't ever let you go.

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,600
PS. The sticker on the front,
I mean it with all my heart.

295
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,600
-[Wit] Damn.
-[Shorty] Wow, shit.

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Amazing.

298
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,040
-Here.
-Take it.

299
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,760
[Wit] Go join the others. Go stand there.
Yeah, go. Hey.

300
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,440
Who belongs to this phone?

301
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,840
Who hasn't come to claim
this amazing cellular phone?

302
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,320
[Wit] I heard that this model
is really tough and durable.

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
Come on, anyone. Whose is it? Anyone?

304
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,480
Where did this phone come from?

305
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,000
[Shorty] I told you, Wit. I knew it.

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,440
Our class had 31 people, not 30.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,400
Well, fuck you, Shorty. Think about it.
Who has this phone?

308
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm starting to remember
that our class had 31 people.

309
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Shit, but I just can't remember
who that be.

310
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,440
It was Nan… something.

311
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,040
She came in the tenth grade,
and left after less than a semester.

312
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,240
Nanno, the psycho.

313
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,599
GRADE 10-1

314
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,680
[teacher] Draw the line first.

315
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,720
Hello there.

316
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,880
My name is Nanno.

317
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm 16.

318
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,040
Today is my first day.

319
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,840
Please be kind.

320
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,600
[inaudible]

321
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,440
[Fong] From what I remember,

322
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,800
Nanno enrolled
in the middle of the semester,

323
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,560
so she didn't have many friends.

324
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
[giggles]
Yes.

325
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
[Fong] We tried to hang out with her,

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,680
but she was always on the phone,
with her boyfriend.

327
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
[light chuckle]
Yes, Tan, yeah.

328
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,160
Yeah.

329
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,800
See you then. I love you too.

330
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,440
Yeah.

331
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,640
-Nanno, you wanna get ice cream with us?
-Mm.

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,680
There's a new shop in front of the school.
You wanna come?

333
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm sorry. I already have plans.

334
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
[Bell] With your boyfriend, right?

335
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,600
You're always talking to your boyfriend.

336
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,320
I mean, don't you want to spend
some time with your friends?

337
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Okay, that's all right.

338
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,640
Next time then.

339
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,880
Maybe you can even bring
your boyfriend with you.

340
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,600
-Yes.
-[Nanno] Okay.

341
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,040
So, next time, then.

342
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,520
[female student] Happy Valentine's Day.

343
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,600
-[Kai] Jerks, don't put these on me.
-[Meng] Whose are they for?

344
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
-[Kai] Hey, you.
-[Meng] Whose are these?

345
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,200
-[Kai] I said no.
-[Meng] You're going down.

346
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
-[Meng] Let's try it.
-[Kai] Hey, don't put it on me.

347
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
[laughing]

348
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,960
[boys cheering]

349
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,640
-[Meng] What the heck are you doing?
-[Kai] Okay, okay.

350
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
[Kai] Here you go.

351
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,280
[Meng] I can't believe you did that.

352
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
[girls] Aw.

353
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,600
[Meng] This is for you?

354
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,840
[Fong] You can have some of that.

355
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,000
[Nanno] Those are pretty.

356
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,760
Hey.

357
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
[Proud] Let's see.

358
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,640
[Bell] "Happy Valentine's Day. From Thap."

359
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,920
Wow, this came with the roses?

360
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
You guys are disgusting.

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,560
[Bell] That's true. But this bouquet is
small, so he must not love you that much.

362
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,600
[Proud] Yeah.

363
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
But Thap is quite biased, you know?

364
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
He only gives flowers to his girlfriend.

365
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,680
[Proud] I'm jealous. I want flowers, too.

366
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Come on, let me put these stickers on you.
Someone will give you roses, too.

367
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,920
[Proud] She's blushing.
[giggles]

368
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Here.

369
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,120
[delivery man] Is there a Nanno?

370
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,440
-[Nanno] Yes?
-Flower delivery.

371
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,200
-Oh, my god.
-Amazing.

372
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,720
Oh, wow.

373
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,720
[Bell] It's so big.
Tan must love her very much.

374
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
[Proud] That's gorgeous. That's so pretty.

375
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,640
If he really loved me,
he'd give them to me himself.

376
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
[Bell] There's a card.

377
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,240
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
FORGIVE ME. SEE YOU.

378
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,720
[Proud] They're the same.
I'm dying to see what Tan looks like.

379
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,520
-[Proud] He must be really handsome.
-Yeah.

380
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,040
And…

381
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
In the card…

382
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
What did Tan do to you
to make you so angry?

383
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,120
It's nothing, really.

384
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,320
He just doesn't have time.

385
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,240
That's not a big deal.
You two are always on the phone together.

386
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,280
So, stop being mad at him
and let us meet him already.

387
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,880
-Yeah.
-Me too.

388
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,600
Me too, I really wanna meet this guy.

389
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,840
Your romantic Mr. Tan.

390
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,480
When he has time, Nanno should tell him
to come hang out.

391
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,160
-[Bell] Right.
-to finally meet this mystery man.

392
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
I'll do my best, okay?

393
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
And your roses are so pretty.

394
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,480
[Proud and Bell] Yeah.

395
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,280
Fong, you like them?

396
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
You can have them.

397
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
Hey.

398
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
Tan didn't give them to me, did he?

399
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,800
If you give these to someone else,
he'll be angry.

400
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,800
If Fong doesn't want them…

401
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,160
I'll just give them to someone else.

402
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,840
Nanno.

403
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,680
[Proud] Nanno promised
that she would let us meet Tan,

404
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,720
but then the plan
would always be postponed

405
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,120
by all those complicated reasons
she came up with.

406
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,160
In the end, Fong just…

407
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,840
Tan can't come here again?

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,320
I had to wait for nothing again.

409
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,840
Will I ever get to meet Tan
in this lifetime?

410
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm…

411
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,920
gonna go to the restroom.

412
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,280
Okay, yeah.

413
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,480
Do you think…

414
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
that Tan even exist at all?

415
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,000
I agree that something is super fishy.

416
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Right?

417
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,000
Who will keep missing plans
like this over and over?

418
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,880
Do you think there's a reason
he doesn't want to meet us?

419
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,080
I think something is up with this Tan guy.

420
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,720
Should I look at her phone?

421
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,880
Are you sure, Fong?

422
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Shut up.

423
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,360
Go ahead. Take a look. I'm so curious.

424
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,320
CONTACTS

425
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,600
-What is it?
-Shit.

426
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,000
-There's nothing here.
-What?

427
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,040
Who is she talking to?

428
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,280
-She was always on the phone.
-No incoming calls in here.

429
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,280
No outgoing either.

430
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,240
Do you wanna go for ice cream now?

431
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,480
Tan is too busy, but I can go.

432
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,440
[suspenseful music playing]

433
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,640
Is there something wrong?
Why are you acting so weird?

434
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,760
No. It's nothing.

435
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,080
There's something we need to do.

436
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,120
Oh, well. That's a shame.

437
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,720
Let's go for some ice cream next time.
All of us, together.

438
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
With or without Tan, okay?

439
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
Yeah. Sure, Nanno.

440
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,440
Yeah.

441
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
Oh, Tan.

442
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
[keypad beeping]

443
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,400
[Nanno giggling]

444
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
[Proud] Nanno who was always on her phone

445
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,960
always chatting away,
was actually talking to…

446
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,240
to no one.

447
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,160
[Shorty] I see.

448
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,280
I think I remember her now.

449
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,040
And then what?

450
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,040
Nothing changed.

451
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,480
She was on her phone even more,

452
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
because nobody would talk to her.

453
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,160
[Nanno] Why? I don't get it. Why?

454
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,680
What?

455
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,760
[screaming]

456
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,800
[suspenseful music playing]

457
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,200
PSYCHO BITCH

458
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,760
CRAZY BITCH TALKING TO NOTHING

459
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,200
I'M CREEPED OUT WHEN I SEE YOU

460
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,160
I FUCKING HATE NANNO

461
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,120
FUCK OFF, BITCH

462
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,840
TAN DOESN'T EXIST
GET THE FUCK OUT

463
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,560
[Fong] And then one day,

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,120
someone attacked her.

465
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,240
She looked really awful.

466
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,880
I remember that.
It was really bad. Blood everywhere.

467
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
[Meng] And then what happened?

468
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,280
I don't know.

469
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,640
It seems like she disappeared
after that day.

470
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,680
And here we are, we all forgot her
before we found that phone.

471
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,600
Can anyone contact Nanno right now?

472
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,760
-She's still our friend.
-How come?

473
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,400
Are you going to cure her, Doctor Kai?

474
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm not a psychiatrist,

475
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,760
but I still know something
that might be able to help.

476
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,320
I wonder how she is right now.

477
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,680
She's probably lying
in a mental hospital somewhere,

478
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,680
being a psycho.

479
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,040
[Shorty chuckles]

480
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Let me see it.

481
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
This can't belong to Nanno.

482
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,560
She left in tenth grade.
She wasn't there when we buried the chest.

483
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,400
This is definitely Nanno's cell phone.

484
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,680
I swear.

485
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,560
MENU

486
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
[Fong] What?

487
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
-It turned on.
-[Shorty] What?

488
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,520
[Chai] Really?

489
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,560
-[Meng] It's been buried for 12 years.
-[Proud] What the fuck?

490
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
-[Bell] True.
-Someone is definitely playing a prank.

491
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,240
[phones ringing]

492
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,240
[all] Shit.

493
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,400
Wit, are you doing this…

494
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,040
[phones continuously ringing]

495
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
[static]
[Nanno] Hi, everyone.

496
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,440
Do you remember who I am?

497
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm Nanno.

498
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,560
Nanno, hey! It's Nanno.

499
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
It's me, Nanno.

500
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,080
Nanno, hey! It's Nanno. It's me, Nanno.

501
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,880
Nanno, hey! It's Nanno. It's me, Nanno.

502
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
Nanno, hey! It's Nanno. It's me, Nanno.

503
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,560
Nanno, hey! It's Nanno. It's me, Nanno.

504
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,520
[echoing]

505
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,040
[Thap] Nanno?

506
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
You are Nanno, right?

507
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
[Nanno] I thought you'd forgotten me.

508
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,800
You remember Nanno now?

509
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,360
Thap.

510
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
You missed me, right?

511
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
I'm back with my class.

512
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
You…

513
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,200
really are Nanno, aren't you?

514
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,720
It's really only been a few years.

515
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,080
Have you already forgotten my face?

516
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,400
No, it's just that a lot has happened
when we last saw you,

517
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,880
but you're still as beautiful as ever.

518
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Hmm. Now that I think about it,

519
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
our whole class

520
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,040
still looks the same.

521
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,520
So what are you up to now?

522
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm still talking to no one
like I was before.

523
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
But you're still so pretty.
You probably have settled down.

524
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,280
Stop it, Meng. You're making me blush.

525
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,200
But I can't compete
with all those pretty little girls.

526
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Did you know that
Meng, on top of being a photographer,

527
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
is also a film maker?

528
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
[Bell] What?

529
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,120
-[Proud] What?
-[Wit] Shit.

530
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,960
[Nanno] Wait, wait, wait.
Think of that as your trailer.

531
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,960
If you guys want to see the full version,
feel free to download.

532
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
It will probably take months
to watch them all.

533
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Meng, you pervert.

534
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,080
Now, stop that.
Don't be mean to your friend.

535
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,440
Chai has his own addiction.
Lots and lots of steroids.

536
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,440
I heard you had to forfeit your medals.

537
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
[Nanno] If your lawyers
hadn't covered it up,

538
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,720
you'd be in a big, big trouble.

539
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,280
So, Nanno, what do you want?

540
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,600
I saw you're having a reunion,
and I didn't wanna come empty-handed.

541
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,280
That's why I made you these gifts
as a surprise.

542
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,720
[Nanno] Like this one.

543
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,720
This building
looks pretty familiar, doesn't it?

544
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
[Nanno] Wit.

545
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,440
Your construction company built
this building, right?

546
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,720
35-STOREY BUILDING COLLAPSED
CULPRIT IN CUSTODY

547
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,960
So, why was someone else arrested
and not you, Wit?

548
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,320
Hiring someone else
to go to jail for you isn't just immoral.

549
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,520
If the police find out about that,

550
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,440
[Nanno] Wit will face serious
consequences.

551
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,160
I'll be honest.

552
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm worried.

553
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,080
What do you want, Nanno?
Can we make a deal with you or something?

554
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
Make a deal like what?

555
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,520
Doctor Kai did with the politicians?

556
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,880
With their money, he built them a hospital
specifically for money laundering.

557
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,280
Cool, right?

558
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,720
How does hospital with no patients

559
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,159
end up with so much cash
running through its accounts?

560
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,080
You think that makes you better than us?

561
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,600
You're still a stupid bitch,
you know that?

562
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,080
Hmm, don't be mean, Bell.

563
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,159
I don't want
to sound superior, especially.

564
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,639
Not with you.

565
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,920
I don't have the guts to fight you.

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
-Huh.
-[scoffs]

567
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I heard you're selling skin care products.

568
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,560
They all sold out.

569
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,719
The sales were so good
you opened another brand,

570
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,080
selling fake cream.

571
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,520
But when the customers reported you,
the products vanished.

572
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,080
WARNING. FAKE.

573
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,480
RUINED FACE. CHEAP BUT FAKE.

574
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,840
Guys, don't listen to her. She's a psycho.

575
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,560
Grab her cell phone. Stop her.

576
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,199
-[Wit] Calm down.
-[Chai] Wit, what the hell?

577
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,760
If we all know each other's secret

578
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,240
and no one says anything,
it'll just end here, won't it?

579
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
Let's see what you can do
without your phone, you bitch.

580
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
Shorty.

581
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
This violent behavior of yours…

582
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,280
You still have it, don't you?

583
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,320
No wonder.

584
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,720
Your wife wants a divorce,

585
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,120
and also wants full custody
of your daughter.

586
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
I'm going to win the case.
Don't you worry.

587
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,520
Hmm.

588
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,280
Let me tell you the truth.

589
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,760
You'll never win the case.

590
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,120
And you're going to lose your daughter.

591
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Shorty's wife has learned her lesson,
since she decided to marry you.

592
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,640
I'll move in with my mom.

593
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,560
[Shorty's wife]
I'll take my daughter, too.

594
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,280
Bitch, I already told you
you can't take her from me.

595
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,160
-Huh?
-Daddy, don't hurt Mommy.

596
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,360
[kid wails]

597
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,720
You think you're perfect, don't you?

598
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,520
The evidence speaks for itself once again.

599
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,080
-[Wit] Shorty, what the fuck is that?
-[Kai] What's wrong with you?

600
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,880
[Nanno] Hot-headed and abusive.

601
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,600
What court would sympathize with you?

602
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,640
[sighs]

603
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
It's been a pleasure
getting to see you all

604
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,040
grow up to have such rich lives.

605
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,320
It makes me truly happy.

606
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,560
[Nanno] Let's forget about the past.

607
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,280
Everyone makes mistakes.

608
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,240
And you know,
I'm everyone's favorite psycho.

609
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,600
This is something we're gonna laugh about.

610
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,040
Now, isn't that right?
[giggles]

611
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,960
[Chai] What are you trying
to get out of this?

612
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
[Kai] Yeah. Stop this now.

613
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,760
[Proud] What do you want?

614
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,360
[Bell] Money? Or do you want revenge?

615
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,440
One person at a time.

616
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,680
If you talk at the same time,
I won't be able to understand.

617
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,000
But it's funny

618
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,840
because when we were at school together,
not a single person wanted to talk to me.

619
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,840
But right now, I'm not sure
I'm gonna be talking to you.

620
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
[Fong] No one wants to talk
to you right now, either.

621
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,440
Because you're a psycho bitch.

622
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,560
Why don't you go and talk
to your imaginary boyfriend?

623
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,280
You'll never be welcome here.

624
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,760
Fong.

625
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,360
Don't be like that. You're so mean.

626
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,520
But that's okay. You know, I understand.

627
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,480
Yes, Fong has depression.
You even have to take medication.

628
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Have you taken your meds today?

629
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,560
-Fuck you.
-[Nanno] Hey.

630
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,760
An angel would never ever swear
again like that.

631
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,480
By the way, this outfit of yours, Fong,

632
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,560
is very beautiful, don't you think?

633
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,760
But it will be more striking

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,760
if you take off your sweater,

635
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,320
and show off your pretty left arm.

00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,200
The prince protecting his Fong.

637
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,800
It's so romantic.

638
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,880
Right, Tan?

639
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,480
Why are you so quiet?

640
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Tan, don't you want to talk to me anymore?

641
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
[giggles]
Yes, Tan, yes.

642
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,760
I think something is up with this Tan guy.

[Bell] It's so big.

644
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,800
Tan must love her very much.

645
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
[Proud] That's gorgeous.

646
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,400
If he really loved me,
he'd give them to me himself.

647
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,360
