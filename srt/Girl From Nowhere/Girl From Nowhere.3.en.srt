than others.

about the same thing once again,

unless it's about the pride
of Lerdvithi School.

of a particular teacher or a student,

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,080
but every single one of us
who refuses to believe

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,560
that humans have any kind of limitations.

We can go further than ever before.

We can do much better.

27

Oh, don't complain. Whenever
we don't have class, it's all good.

Have you never heard
of personal hygiene or what?

Finally, I would like to share with you

the humble motto of our Lerdvithi School.

"Even in darkness,
real diamonds will shine."

[Pui] Why do you always bring me here
when we go for a walk?

51
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,880
Coming here won't get your name
inscribed on the pole

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
or get your hands imprinted.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
This is why your name
will never be on the pole.

54
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
You don't care
about anything enough to try.

55
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Your name won't be on this pole,
or that pole, and never will be.

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,880
Why must you always try
to insult me, like this?

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Okay.

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
Well… I guess…

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
I feel…

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,760
a little jealous. They're good at things.

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,360
I just feel like such a loser.

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
Did someone say something
to upset you again?

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,800
Mew, can you put down your phone
and eat first?

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Huh?

65
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
Just a sec.

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
You are always on that thing.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
This is why your grades dropped.

68
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,720
Why can't you be more
like your sister, Pang, huh?

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,920
[Mew] I have a 3.5 GPA.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
And I've won a silver medal.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,200
[Pui] But they have a 4.0 GPA
and gold medals.

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,600
But you don't have to feel bad
because you still have me,

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
who has a 3.3 GPA

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,440
and a bronze medal.
Isn't that right, yeah?

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,120
Right.

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,480
[Plearn] You both like to throw
a pity party.

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,080
That's why neither of you will ever excel.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,960
[Plearn] In the future,
you will both become burdens to society.

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Didn't you listen to the principal today?

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,640
He always says without limits.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
You spiral out of control.

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,480
Hey, Nanno.
Can you come here for a second?

83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
[Nanno] Sure.

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
[Plearn] Look at Nanno.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,480
She arrived only two weeks ago,

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
but she has already discovered
her special abilities.

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,120
Nanno, dear, can you help them
find their own special skills?

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,320
We don't want the two of them becoming…

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,520

our school down.

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Of course.

I've prepared some special dishes
for the new genius at our school.

-Let's go.
-Okay.

"Buddhism."

I have good news for you all.

112
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,880
Last week, we announced a genius
named Nanno.

113
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
Today, we have a new genius.

114
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,200
This person just won the first prize
from the Thai Literature Association

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,600
that was announced last night.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
That person is Pui.

[students applauding]

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
[Plearn] Pui, why don't you share
something with the class?

119
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,240
[Pui] Sure.

120
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,039
This is the first time I won.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm actually very proud.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Everyone has their own special skills.

123
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,799
Believe in all of your potential
and strive to work hard.

124
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,800
Go beyond your limitations
and you can become successful like us.

125
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Thank you, all.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,600
[Plearn] Pui, thank you so much
for listening to my advice

127
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,360
and taking the action to improve yourself.

128
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
[Nanno] Hey, Pui.

129
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,320
I'll add you to the group chat
of the geniuses, okay?

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960

[Plearn] Congratulations, Pui.

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
You finally discovered
the genius that lies within you.

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,520
I've done it before, you know.

143
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,480
What's that?

Put my fingers
on someone else's hand print.

I did it on my first day here.

Hey. Don't you think it's weird that

147
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
Pui can suddenly write
a good novel within a week?

148
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,480
Do you want to know the secret, Mew?

149
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,280
What secret?

150
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
For something like this,

151
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
if you want to know, you have to…

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,920
Nanno, come on.

153
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
Okay, I'll tell you.

154
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
If you want to become a genius like me,

155
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,800
all you have to do is go to Google,

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
press Control-C

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
and Control-V.

158
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,040
And that's it.

159
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,960
Wait.

160
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,080
Are you trying to say that Pui
was able to write a novel

161
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,120
because she copied it from Google?

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,840
It's harsh to say she copied it.

163
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,720
If you would ask Pui, she would tell you

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,440
Mew, I'm very proud of you

329
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,520
for winning the first prize
from Siam Arts.

330
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,560
I'll let you display
and present your work onstage.

331
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Why are we just showing
what we have already done?

332
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
Won't that be way too boring?

333
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,000
[Plearn] That's what I thought, too.

334
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,080
Mew…

335
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,560
should create a piece of art onstage.

336
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Well…

337
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,600
Miss Plearn,

338
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't think anyone
would want to watch that.

339
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,960
[student 1] I want to see it.

340
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,720
[student 2] Yeah, I want to see it, too.

341
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,880
-[students] Me, too.
-[laughter]

342
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,960
[Plearn] Everyone wants to see it.

343
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,120
If we advertise it like this,

344
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,160
everyone will want to come and watch.

345
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll make sure to invite the judges
from Siam Arts,

346
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,760
reporters, students from other schools,

347
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
and the institute that ranks schools.

348
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,280
When they see you,

349
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,040
we might win for the second time in a row.

350
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,360
[sighs]

351
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,560
I think we should broadcast it live, too.

352
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,440
Great idea. Let's do a live broadcast
through our Facebook page

353
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,560
so that the whole world can watch.

354
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh, my god, Mew.

355
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,720
You'll become famous
around the entire globe.

Hey.

360
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
Why did you do that?

361
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,720
You know that I…

362
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,040
What are you scared of?

363
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
You're a true genius now.

364
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,080
That's fucking bullshit.

365
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,400
You did that on purpose.

366
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,240
What did I do wrong?

367
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,960
You don't know?

368
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,960
You…

369
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,040
Why are you messing with me?

370
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,360
Why aren't you messing with Pui?

371
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,800
Mew, I didn't get you in trouble.

372
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,400
Weren't you the one
who wanted to be a genius

373
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,880
and become famous?

374
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
I just helped you along.

375
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,920
What did I do wrong?

376
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800

Do you fucking realize
what you've done to me?

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,160
Mew, best of luck to you.

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,760
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting
your workflow.

393
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,120
Hey, did you see that post on Facebook?

394
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,080
Someone said that you copied
their friend's artwork,

395
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,360
but I'm not sure
what happened to the post.

Don't be mean to me.

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm your biggest fan at school.

400
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
I'll be waiting
for your next piece, genius.

401
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,960
You'll be waiting for it?

Right.

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
Pui.

404
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,320
I need your help. Can we talk?

Pretty please?

408
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
[Mew] Pui.

409
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,040
[Pui] You're not mad at me anymore?

410
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,720
-Hmm.
-[chuckles]

411
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
I wasn't actually mad at you.

412
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
I was jealous of you.

413
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,320
I was jealous…

414
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,920
because you become a genius.

415
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
I was jealous because everyone thought
you are special now.

416
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,200
And I was still just me.

417

Sure. What would you like me to do?

493
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,680
I wanted to see you create
a piece of art onstage.

494
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,000
But then this happened.

495
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,480
Now I have to sit here
and treat your wound instead.

496
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,480
Your dad was going to close the shop
to watch you.

497
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,080
He also invited your grandma
and all your aunties.

498
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
Luckily, I stopped them in time,

499
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
or they might have come for nothing.

500
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah, I feel really bad about that, too.

501
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,840
Mm.

502
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,720
[Mew's mom] By the way, what happened?

503
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,480
How did you and Pui end up
fighting with each other?

504
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,480
You've been friends
since childhood, right?

505
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,320
[doorbell rings]

506
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,199
Stay here. I'll get it.

507
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,600
-[Mew's mom] Oh, Hello, ma'am.
-[Plearn] Hi.

508
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,760
[Mew's mom] Please come in.

509
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,639
Mew, your teacher and friends
came to see you.

510
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,800
Is your hand getting better?

511
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,760
No, not yet.

512
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
[Plearn] Don't worry.

513
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,639
The school punished Pui
by not letting her display her work.

514
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,920
If she hadn't won her writing award,
we would have expelled her.

515
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,880
Pui was so violent towards you.

516
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,280
Who knew that she could be so angry.

517
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,160
[Plearn] How are you?

518
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,600
Can you move your fingers a little bit?

519
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,920
Can you try?

520
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You might still be able to go onstage.

521
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Ow!

522
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
I can't, I'm sorry.

523
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,240
But didn't you already go
to see the doctor?

524
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,320
Yeah, but I still can't work
with my arm like this.

525
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
[Plearn] Our school's open house will be…

526
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,280
just a disaster.

527
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,520
Hmm… Do you remember
what the principal always says, Mew?

528
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,440
"Even in darkness,
real diamonds will shine."

529
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,720
If I were you, I'd still go onstage.

530
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,720
You can't let the school lose
its reputation.

531
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
But if I go on stage and don't do well,

532
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,120
I'll ruin the school's reputation
even more.

533
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,240
But you can still use
your left arm, can't you?

534
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,680
You posted it on Instagram.

535
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
[Plearn] Right?

536
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,440
Here. Let me find it.

537
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,200
Just a sec.

538
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,840
I DREW THIS WITH MY LEFT HAND.

539
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,760
[chuckles]
That means, you can go on stage then.

540
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,520
[Nanno] Congrats, Mew.

541
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,880
You can share your special skills
with the world.

Silence from all of humanity.

The leaves drift and the birds sing.

547
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
We hear the sound of corruption.

548
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,280
Thank you.

549
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,600

551
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
Thank you, everyone

552
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,600
for all your patience.

553
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,600
We've now arrived
at the special moment in time

554
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,200
that you've all been waiting for.

555
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,200
It's time for the spotlight to shine

556
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,160
on a Michelangelo and Picasso
of Lerdvithi School.

557
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,080
She's our much-celebrated artist,

558
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,360
a true original,

559
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,880
please welcome
my friend and fellow genius, Mew.

[applauding]

561

-Please, I don't--
-Are you ready?

562
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,160
I know you are.

563
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,440
You have to go on stage right now.

564
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
-I believe in you.
-[sobbing]

565

Mew.

-[Mew] I can't.
-Mew.

567
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,240
You are my genius. You hear me?

[sobs]

569
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,400
[Nanno] Mew is considered
a true master of her craft

570
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,880
because she can create
amazing masterpieces…

571
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
in just a short period of time.

572
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
And even though…

573
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,160
she was in a terrible accident,

574
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,640
that didn't stop her
from performing for us.

575
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,320
Today,

576
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,920
everyone will experience
how Mew creates her art.

577
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,680
Everyone, please prepare your phones.

578
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,040
We will be doing a live stream.

Get ready for the whole world
to witness together

You stole my Indonesian friend's artwork!

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,800
[principal] That's complete nonsense!

597
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,800
It's not nonsense.

598
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,080
She really stole my friend's work.

599
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,840
Here. Take a look.

600
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,440
The artwork you all praised
and said, "Wow, it's very good."

601
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,080
She just stole someone else's artwork

602
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,080
and splashed a bunch
of colors all over it.

603
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,440
-Isn't that true?
-[Mew sobs]

604
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,880
[Mew] I didn't--

605
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,640
[DWY student] The evidence is right
in front of your eyes. Tell them.

606
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,160
Tell them you think this school is stupid.

607
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,200
The Siam Arts Association is also
stupid enough to get fooled by you.

608
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,120
Look at it carefully.

609
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,880
You can lie to others,

610
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,480
but you can't lie to yourself.

611
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
[principal] Let me see that.

612
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,040
[Mew sobbing]

613
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,240
It doesn't look like Mew's artwork at all.

614
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Which school are you from anyway?

615
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,440
[principal] "D-W-Y."

[principal] I see.

619
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,560
It's the rival school
that always ends up in second place, huh?

620
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,400
The school that continues
to follow our every move.

621
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,200
Whether we go to the left or the right,

622
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,000
your school follows our every step.

623

[DWY student] This is nothing to do
with my school.

[principal] Of course, it does.

625
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,400
You want to destroy
our pristine reputation,

626
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,760
and that's why
you're accusing our student.

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,960
I'm telling the truth. I swear.

Are you really speaking the truth?

Do tell us, just how well do you know art?

draw us a picture instead.

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,240
Create a piece of art just like this one.

636

Come on. Do it!

637
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
So they will see what is real
and what is fake.

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
[principal] Do it, Mew.

639
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,840
Do it so that she stops talking nonsense.
Come on!

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,480
[suspenseful music]

653
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,600
[sobbing quietly]

654
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,920
[whimpering]

655
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,760
[sobbing]

656
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,240
[whimpering]

657
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,760
You see this? It looks just…

658
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,440
like the other beautiful painting
she drew.

659
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,960
Believe me, this is the real genius.
[chuckles]

660
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,440
Her artwork is gentle

661
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,000
powerful yet subtle.

662
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,040
The way art should be.

663
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,560
In addition, let me be perfectly clear,

664
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,440
it's impossible that Lerdvithi School
and Siam Arts Association would praise

665
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,240
a fake artwork or a fake genius.
Never in a million years.

666
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,760
[DWY student] Are you crazy?
They don't look the same at all!

667
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,720
[principal] You are the crazy one.

668
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,480
Why can't you see
that they have the exact same style.

669
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Why can't you see that Mew
is a true genius?

670
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,680
Because she's not a genius
and they're not the same.

671
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
-Come on!
-[Plearn] Stop!

672
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,800
Stop slandering Mew,
or I'm gonna make sure

673
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,400
to sue you and everyone at your school.

674
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm not slandering anyone.
I'm telling the truth.

675
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,760
The ugly truth is,
you are from Denwittaya School,

676
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,560
the forever-second-place school.

677
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,800
You just want to discredit
Lerdvithi School

678
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,320
and everyone at Siam Arts Association.

679
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,120
Get out now.

680
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,080
Guard.

681
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,240
Stop it. I'm leaving.

682
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,040
[audience booing]

683
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,760
-[DWY student] Don't blame the messenger.
-[audience booing]

684
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,880
-What are you booing at?
-[booing continues]

685
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,720
You're all stupid!
You can't even tell what art is!

686
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,000
[audience booing]

687
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,520
[DWY student] What is wrong with you?

688
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,240
The rudeness and lack of expertise
gave her away. What a sad school.

689
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,320
-[chuckles]
-[student] Boo!

690
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,040
You must be in a state of shock.

691
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,760
Don't worry, my dear.

692
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,760
She's just jealous of you.

693
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,240
Listen. You are already a genius to me.

694
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,800
No one can take that away from you now.

695
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,360
I'm really proud of you, Mew, my dear. Hm?

696
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,320
You are truly a role model
for everyone here,

697
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,080
and a shining example of our geniuses.

698
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,160
You are living up to the motto
of Lerdvithi School.

699
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,160
"Even in darkness,
real diamonds will shine."

700
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,720
[laughs loudly]

701
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,520
Yes.

702
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,880
Now that everything has settled down,

703
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,040
why don't we just listen to Mew's speech?

704
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,480
It might inspire us all today.

705
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,840
"Thank you, everyone,

706
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,200
for supporting me here today.

707
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,920
Standing by me,

708
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,200
and believing in who I am.

709
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,640
[sniffles]
I really appreciate that.

710
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
Everyone has gathered here today

711
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,240
to fight for me.

712
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,120
[sniffles]

713
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,520
I believe that

714
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,360
what we fought for today

715
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,560
will be a good example.

716
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,120
A good example…
[whimpers]

717
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,080
It will be a good example

718
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,200
for the society

719
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,240
to learn about love and unity.

720
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,240
This would make…

721
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,120
our society stable in the future
to come under the leadership

722
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,760
of the geniuses

723
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,440
of Lerdvithi School.

724
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,800
Finally,

725
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
I would like to end this speech
with the motto of Lerdvithi School.

726
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,520
'Even in darkness,

727
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,440
real diamonds will shine.'"

728
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,880

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,040

[applause continues]

732
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,760
[Nanno] I wish you happiness
in this world, Mew.

733
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,080
