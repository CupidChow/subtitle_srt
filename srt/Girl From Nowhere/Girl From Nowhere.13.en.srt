Hello there.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,680
My name is Nanno.

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm 16.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Today is my first day.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Please be kind.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,480
[Fong] From what I can remember,

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,200
Nanno enrolled
in the middle of the semester.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,520
We tried to hang out with her,

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,840
but she was always
on the phone with her boyfriend.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,120
[giggles]
Yes, Tan, yes.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,040
Yeah.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,760
You're always talking to your boyfriend.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Don't you want to spend some time
with your friends?

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,680
[Bell] Oh, wow. It's so big.
Tan must love her very much.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,800
I think something is up with this Tan guy.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
Should I look at her phone?

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,240
There's nothing here.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,760
[Proud] Nanno who was always on her phone,

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,720
always chatting away, actually talking to…

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,920
to no one.

PSYCHO BITCH
CRAZY BITCH TALKING TO NOTHING

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
It seems like she disappeared
after that day.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,200
[Nanno, on video] Hi, everyone.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,280
It's me, Nanno.

28

Nanno, hey! Nanno.

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,800
[Nanno] Nanno, hey! Nanno.

It's me, Nanno.

31

It's me, Nanno. Nanno, hey!
Nanno. It's me, Nanno.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,280
You remember Nanno now?

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Thap?

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,400
I saw you were having a reunion,

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,040
and I didn't wanna come empty-handed.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Right, Tan?

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
[Nanno, on video]
Nanno, hey. It's me, Nanno.

Nanno, hey. It's me, Nanno.

Why are you so quiet?

42

Tan, don't you wanna talk
to me anymore, Tan?

[Proud gasps]

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,160
I really wanna meet Tan.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,800
[Proud]
We had to wait around for nothing again.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,360
Will I ever get to meet Tan
in this lifetime?

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,000
I will go to the restroom.

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,920
I think something is up with this Tan guy.

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
Right?

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,320

[line ringing]

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,920
[Tan] Nanno, I can't talk right now.
I'm with Wit and the guys.

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,120
Let's talk when we meet tonight, okay?

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,160
Nanno?

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
Is something wrong?

Are you okay?

61
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Don't be mad.
Fong already suspects something.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,640
Was that really Thap's voice
we just heard?

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,680
-[Proud] Are you deaf?
-[Bell] What?

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
[Proud] If that wasn't Thap's voice
on the phone, then who the fuck was it?

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,400
[Bell] What? I just wanted to make sure.
Did I do something wrong?

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes, you did.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
Can't you see Fong is devastated?
You're such a--

68

Will you guys shut the fuck up?

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Let's fuck that bitch up.

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,080
Yeah, yeah. Slut-slap her.

71
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
If I were you,

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,440
and she did that, I would kill her.

73
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,680
I'll make her wish she was dead.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
She'll pay.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
[Nanno] You wanna go for ice cream now?

77
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Tan is too busy,

78
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,040
but I can go.

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,320
Is…

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,640
Is something wrong?

81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
Why are you acting weird?

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

83
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
There's something we need to do.

84
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
Oh, well. That's a shame.

85
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,040
Let's go for ice cream next time.

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,360
With or without Tan, yeah?

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
Then, after that,

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Your pretty little angel
and my good, loyal friend, Fong,

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,400
she spread a rumor all over school

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,960
that I had an imaginary boyfriend.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
Isn't that right?

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,640
You thought I didn't know that?

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Our thing ended a long time ago.

What more do you want?

95
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,840
How can our love affair

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
possibly be over

97
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,920
when I'm still in love with you?

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,640
[Nanno] As soon as I became
the subject of the school's gossip,

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Tan permanently disappeared
from this world.

[Thap] Why did you have to do that?

111
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,800
Why did you have to hurt her like that?

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
What if you killed her?

113
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,840
What if she died?

114
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
[Thap] I can get in trouble for this.
Don't you understand?

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't do this anymore, Fong.

116

I'm done, Fong.

That was the first time you cut yourself.

The first cut you used
to tie yourself to Tan.

127
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,400
I wonder how many you need,
how many cuts you need exactly

128

to tie yourself to another person.

129
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,880
Come to think of it.
If I had to choose between us,

me or Fong,

131

I'm not sure who's more of a psycho.

132

[Nanno] You might have thought
that you won,

133
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,840
but the fact that Tan is still with you,

134
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,000
that he married you is what I wanted.

135

Isn't that right, Tan?

136
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,440
You're still with Fong
because you can't bring yourself to leave.

You don't want to feel guilty,
so you have to stay.

Isn't that what you told Proud?

Right, Proud?

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,600
Don't listen to her, Fong. She's lying.

Fong, just put the pieces together.

Why isn't it this age
is your pretty best friend still single?

Just give it a little bit of thought.

144
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Proud is a flight attendant and…

145
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,440
and Thap is a pilot.

146

We were on the same flight,
so Thap picked me up.

It's not what you think, Fong.

151

She would never do that to you.

-[Thap] Fong.
-[Proud] Do you want to fight with me?

-[Thap] Hey, calm down.
-[Fong] Let me go!

169

Fong, enough.

-[Fong] Let me go!
-Fong.

171
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
Let me go! How can you do this to me?

172
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,920
How can you do this to me?

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,720
It's because you're like this!
This is why I have someone else.

174
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,960
[Thap] Come on.

Proud, are you all right?

176
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,840
Get up carefully.

177
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,440
Poor Fong.

178
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,440
You even quit your job
to take care of him,

179
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,440
and his house, didn't you?

180
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,680
[Nanno] But in the end,

181
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,680
what do you have to show
for all your troubles?

There she is.

What are you doing? Are you crazy?

190
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,560
[Fong] It's you! You're the one
who made me crazy!

You really shouldn't be so hard on her.

[Fong panting]

200
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,079

Fong didn't tell you?

Fong has been pregnant
for over three months now.

I'm sorry.

Fong.

212

You don't have to do anything
with him anymore, Thap.

213

I'm so sorry.

[Thap] Fong! Fong!

Okay, Fong, take a deep breath.

216
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,880
Fong, you're going to be okay, okay?
Fong, stay with me. Stay with me, Fong.

Of course, friendships

[Nanno] In high school,
you guys really had a good time with me.

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
Isn't it weird?

225
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
Everybody thinks they're good persons

226
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,760
but when something like this happens,

227

And that is who you all really are.

232
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,360
Whenever someone everyone can hate,
your bond became even stronger.

233
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,720
Don't you think that's interesting?

234
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,600
I wonder how much
do you really love each other.

235

[Shorty] What do you want, Nanno?

Hmm.

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
Now, the question is,

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,560
"What exactly did I do to you all?"

239
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
Bitch, did you spike our food?

240
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
No.

241
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,720
But I did spike your drinks.

331
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
[Nanno] Hey.

332
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,280
I want to thank you.

333
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,080
If you all weren't my friends,

334
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,480
I wouldn't have anyone to talk to.

[somber music playing]

336
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,120
PSYCHO BITCH

337
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,560
CRAZY BITCH TALKING TO NOTHING

338
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,800
[Nanno] Many people think
that the time spent in school

339
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,200
is the most happy time in their lives.

340
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,920
We graduate in school,

341
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,120
walk away with friendship

342
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,320
and good memories in our hearts,

343
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,160
and we go on with our lives.

344
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,920
We grow up and think back with nostalgia,

345
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,280
but graduation may not be the end
that you want it to be.

346
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
It may be the beginning of something

347
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,480
much, much scarier.

348
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,840
Shit.

349
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
I had a nightmare.

350
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,640
It felt very real.

351
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,240
[Nanno laughs maniacally]

352
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,440
So, we should do this again next year.

353
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,600
[Nanno] It was really fun, just like
everyone said it would be.

[piano music playing]

355
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,040
Life in high school is beautiful.

356
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Teachers are role models
for their students.

357
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,560
They teach us right from wrong,

358
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
and they tell us to apologize

359
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,320
-so that we can making mistakes
-[breathing heavily]

360
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,440
-that you just have to apologize for
-[screaming]

361
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,560
again and again.

362
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,760
Forgive us, Nanno.

363
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,720
You mean you're sorry again?

365
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,120
[Nanno] It makes us realize

366
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,520
that we have to do everything in our power

367
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,080
to be better than everyone else,

368
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,680
only to find out in the end

369
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,600
that it wasn't worth it at all.

370
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,440
It tells us that beauty
is the most important thing in our lives,

371
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,280
and if we can't be more beautiful,

372
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,840
then we should tear everyone else down

373
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,560
It tells us that if we worship money,

374
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
money will become more valuable

375
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,040
It would be more valuable
than a human being.

376
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,560
It tells us that even the weak can be evil

377
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
if they're given power.

378
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,280
And just like what everyone already knows,

379
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,240
karma is the consequence of an action.

380

Why won't it come off?

Where is everyone?

These people

They're ruining the educational system
for all of us.
