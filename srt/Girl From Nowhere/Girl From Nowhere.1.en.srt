00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,960
[Nanno] Everyone likes to think
they're a good person.

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,960
But good can't exist without evil.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,960
[Nanno] Pleasure without pain.

[birds chirping]

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,240
[Nanno] Humans are not
some noble creatures

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
only capable of good.

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,120
They have a dark,
filthy soul heading deep inside…

[girl screaming]

[Nanno] …begging to come out.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,720
Given the opportunity, they might just do
bad things to get what they want.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,960
But don't ever forget,
that when you play with fire… 

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,920
you will get burned.

[theme music]

16
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
[Win] In conclusion,
our experiment worked.

17
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,560
We made students watch a Buddhism video
that encourage them to meditate.

18
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
It increased their concentration
and has received positive feedbacks

19
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,960
from both students and parents.

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,720
Now to success,
our school is more equipped

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,240
to greet students
with new innovative teaching methods.

22
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,840
[principal] That's fantastic, Win.

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Thanks to you, other schools are using
our meditation model, too.

24
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,720
This experiment has been
a tremendous success.

25
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
[principal] And the press
about the project

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
has been phenomenal.

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Win, thank you for everything you've done.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh… You're welcome.

29
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
[Win] Thanks a lot.

30
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
Anyone else have something to say?

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,480
Uh…

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,200
I'd like to suggest a similar project
to teach students about safe sex.

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,280
[Mali] These are some notes
that I have prepared about the proposal.

34
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
Please take a look.

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you suggesting we have condom
vending machines in the school?

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
Yes. Condoms will protect
our students from STDs

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
and prevent pregnancies.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,920
In this day and age, students need
to learn how to have safe sex.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,160
This disgusting idea
is coming from a young woman.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,880
Excuse me, Jib.

42
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,520
This project has nothing to do
with my gender.

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,320
Please just focus on the content.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,640
You're not preventing it,

45
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
-you're encouraging them.
-[chuckles]

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,360
[Mali] But we can't force kids
at this age not to think about sex.

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,080
They're teenagers.

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,200
But it might make innocent students
who have never even thought about sex

49
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,480
to think that they should
probably be doing it too.

50
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,720
[Mali] If you would please read
my entire proposal, Troe,

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
you will see there are
many other aspects to this campaign.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,240
It's not just a condom vending machine.

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,280
[Jib] What you've proposed

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,880
will only make our students
more obsessed with sex.

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,760
A teacher with this point of view
is harmful to our students.

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,520
You should be fired.

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, I think we should take a step back.

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,240
Actually, I can understand
both sides here.

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
[Win] First of all,
we should carefully examine

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,400
all the pros and cons of this proposal.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,600
But instead of making any decisions
about this project right now,

62
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,800
why don't we create
another video lesson in the meantime?

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,320
The video could suggest daily activities

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,960
and meditation techniques
that would be beneficial to the students.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,560
[Win] We could use yoga
and mindful breathing.

66
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
It would calm them down,
take their minds off sex,

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,320
and help them concentrate on their studies
and extracurricular activities.

68
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,600
It will guide the students to live
more mindful lives.

69
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
[principal] Now, I think
that is a good idea.

70
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,040
Only last year, I'm proud to say

71
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,320
our school was named
"Purest School of the Year".

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
We should build on that distinction

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
and continue to be a good role model
for other schools in the country.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
As for you, Mali…

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,440

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Hello there, I'm Nanno.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
It's nice to meet you all.

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,640
Good. Nanno,
why don't you sit next to Mei.

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,680
Take a seat.

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
-Okay.
-Okay.

82
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,720
[Mali] Win will be your homeroom teacher
for the next two weeks.

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Make sure you behave, okay?

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Don't give him a headache.
Do you understand?

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
[door opens, closes]

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
[Mali] Yes, Win? What is it?

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,640
[Win] Can I talk to your class?

88
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
Oh, yeah, of course.

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Good morning, everyone.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm looking for some volunteers
to help me with the video I'm shooting

91
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
about yoga for meditation.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
It would be great to have a few students
who already has some experience,

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
basic yoga.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Anyone interested?

95
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I love yoga!

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
Thank you so much.

97
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Anyone else?

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,840
[Win] Are you a new student?
Why haven't I seen you before?

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,480
[Mali] Oh, today is her first day.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Her name is Nanno.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, Nanno.

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
That's a cute name.

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
[Win] Thank you, Nanno.

104
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,360
Is there anyone else?

105
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Hmm…

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
How about Mei?

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,400
You do yoga, don't you?

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
[Mali] And you've helped Mr. Win
when he shot his last video too.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,280
-Isn't that right?
-[Win] Yeah.

110
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,600
Mei seems to be busy. That's all right.
Two people are enough.

111
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,440
Okay. Two students, then.

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,640
-[Win] Okay.
-[Mali] Good.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,280
Both of you, please meet me
at the video lab after school.

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
We'll rehearse and film
for an hour and a half each day.

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
-[Win] Sounds good?
-Yeah.

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,120
[Win] Thank you, everyone.

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,160
-Thank you, Mali.
-[Mali] Thank you.

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,960
[Ing] Hey.

119
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,560
He really is the cutest, isn't he?

120
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,200
It's too bad, he's already married.

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh, really?

122
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,160
[Win] Okay. Next position.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,360
Let me adjust you a bit.

124
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,560
You're okay, right?

125
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
All right, Nanno, can you stand up?

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,920
Um…

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,840
I think maybe you need
to bend back some more.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
Okay.

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,280
[Wan] All right, let's see what you wrote.
You finish pretty fast, huh?

130
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,080
-[Vaew] But I work hard, Mom.
-[Wan] Aha…

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
[Wan] All right, let me see.

132
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,840
[Win] Your mom made
stir-fried sugar snap peas again.

133
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,480
-Whose favorite is that?
-[Wan giggling]

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
How did it go today, at school?

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,919
My English teacher assigned us
an essay today.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Dad, it was longer than usual, too.

137
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,560
-Ohh.
-[Wan] Listen to this.

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
"My idol is a workaholic.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,680
He has a lot of work to do.
But never forgets to have time for me.

140
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,080
He talks slow and calm but never hesitates
to give me the warmest smile."

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,080
[Win chuckles]

142
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,840
[Wan] "He has only one love
but it's not exactly one love."

143
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Mom.

144
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
-[Wan] "Because he has two hearts…
-[Vaew] Mo…

145
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,080
-…one for me and one for my Mom."
-Mom, that's enough.

146
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,440
-"I'm glad to be his daughter."
-Mom, please stop.

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
-"My idol, my Dad."
-[Vaew] Enough.

148
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,080
[Wan laughing]
Fine. I'm done.

149
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,720
Why do you always have to embarrass me

150
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,240
-like that?
-Why?

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you so shy about it, huh?

152
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
[Wan] Don't be embarrassed.
Your essay is good.

153
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
[school bell rings]

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Nanno.

155

[Ing] Nanno, we don't want to be late.
We should go.

156
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm sorry, Ing.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,560
Win told me to tell you that…

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,680
he doesn't have time to film us today.

159
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh…

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,320
That's good. I can go home early.

161
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
Okay, I think I'm gonna go then.

162
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,280
-[Nanno] Bye.
-Bye-bye.

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
Mei, bye-bye.

164
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,440
Mei, what were you saying?

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Hmm… No, I'm… I'm leaving, too.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,640
I didn't… I wasn't saying anything.

167
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
[Nanno] Hello, Win.

168
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,840
[Win] Oh, Nanno.

169
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Where's Ing at?

170
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
Ing isn't feeling well today.

171
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,600
[Win] Really?

172
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,880
Hmm… do you want to cancel our session?

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,320
Oh, we can't do that.

174
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,560
The thing is,
we're already behind schedule.

175
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,600
So, let's just film you alone, okay?

176
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Sure.

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
[Win] All right, get ready.

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,560
[Win] Start anytime now, Nanno.

179
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
[classical music]

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
I think you're too tired.

181
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,880
Do you need a break?

182
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
Are you sure about this?

183
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,920
Why wouldn't I be?

184
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,240
Just want to make sure you know
what you're doing.

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,640
[Win] You do know
what you have to do now, right?

186
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
Meet me tomorrow at the same time.

187
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay.

188
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,840
Come in, Mei.

189
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
Hi, Ma'am.

190
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
I…

191
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,160
I need to talk to you…
about something serious.

192
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
Of course, have a seat.

193
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,480
Now, what's going on?

194
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,760
[Mali] You can talk to me about anything.

195
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,040
You don't have to worry.

196
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Well…

197
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
A friend of mine.

198
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,480
She's…

199
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,720
pregnant.

200
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,360
Okay.

201
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,560
Has she told her parents anything
about what's going on yet?

202
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
Not yet. They don't know anything.

203
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,960
And…

204
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
has she told the father anything?

205
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,040
-[Mali] Hmm.
-But…

206
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
the father…

207
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
He wants her to…

208
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
have…

209
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
an abortion.

210
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Hmm…

211
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,640
And is that what your friend wants to do?

212
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Actually, there are many solutions
to this problem.

213
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,320
Like she could drop out and come back

214
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,720
-to school after--
-But my friend don't want to do that.

215
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,920
Okay. Then I kind of understand now.

216
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
So what did you want to talk to me about?

217
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
Ma'am…

218
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,120
do you happen to know where…

219
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
she…

220
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,720
could get an abortion?

221
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Mei.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,520
If that's what you really want,

223
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,680
I can take you there.

224
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,520
But…

225
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,240
-it's not me. It's not me.
-[Mali] Wait, Mei. Please, I…

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,760
[pants]

227
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,480
-[Nanno] I know a place you can go.
-[gasps]

228
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,040
If you want me to take you.

229
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,800
You didn't close the door all the way.

230
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
But don't worry about it.

231
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm not going to tell anyone.

232
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
[gasps, pants]

233
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
I can take you there.

234
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,200
Don't cry.

235
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,440
[school bell ringing]

236
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,640
[Win] Nanno, Ing.

237
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm afraid I need to cancel today.
Something just came up.

238
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,160
-Okay.
-Sure.

239
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
You, Nanno, why don't you meet me
in the video lab after lunch, okay?

240
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
I need to reshoot
some of what we did yesterday.

241
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
It won't take long.

242
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
Don't you want me to be there, too?

244
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,760
No, I don't. They're only Nanno's scenes.

245
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,120
-Oh.
-See you then.

246
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
Didn't he cancel yesterday?

247
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,760
He changed his mind
after you already left.

248
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,040
He said he was behind.

249
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,440
Hey, then you got to be alone with him.

250
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,680
[Ing] I'm so jealous of you, girl.

251
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,640
Can you pretend to be sick
so I can be alone with him next time?

252
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Aren't you afraid
that someone will come in here?

253
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,359
[Win] Hmm… don't worry.

254
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
This is my private space.

255
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,440
No.

256
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
It's our private space.

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
No one can come here
without my permission.

258
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Okay then.

259
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
I have something to show you.

260
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,040
You look great on film.

261
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,920
[tense music]

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
[percussive music]

263
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
Win.

264
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
You have a family, don't you?

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Let's not talk about that.

266
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
We don't have much time.

267
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
-But Win, you do know…
-[moans]

268
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
…that what we're doing is wrong.

269
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,240
Aren't you afraid
of the consequences of your actions?

270
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
The consequences of my actions?

271
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,280
I don't think you wanna know
what the consequences will be.

272
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,520
If I decide to release this video,

273
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
what will happen to you?

274
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,480
You don't want me to release them, do you?

275
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Wan.

276
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm so hungry.
What are you making for dinner?

277
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,440
Wan, is something wrong?

278
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,600
But where did you find this?

279
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
[Win] Where?

280
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,200
I didn't find it.

281
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,440
A girl named Nanno returned it.

282
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,160
[Wan] She seems like a nice girl.

283
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,920
You forgot your cell phone,

284
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,880
and she asked Troe for our address
then she came straight from school.

285
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,200
That girl, she already went home, right?

286
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,040
No, she's upstairs right now.

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,920
Those two get along so well
so I invited her to stay for dinner.

288
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,680
She might need to go home early, Wan.

289
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,560
[Wan] No. I already asked her.

290
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,200
[Vaew] Thank you.

291
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
Thank you, Ma'am.

292
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,640
[Vaew] I really think
you should eat more, Nanno.

293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,520
Don't you think you need
to gain some weight?

294
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,080
'Cause you're so thin right now.

295
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000
[Nanno] Really?

296
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
But your father told me
that I had a good body.

297
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,680
That's why he asked me
to be in his yoga video.

298
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,680
So you're the one helping Win
with his video.

299
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
[Wan] You do look very athletic.
I'm sure you're great at yoga.

300
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,080
-[Wan giggling]
-Thank you so much.

301
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,280
You should join us
when we're filming sometime.

302
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
The three of us can have fun.

303
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,320
[tense music]

304
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
[Vaew] Is Nanno good at yoga, Dad?

305
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,880
-Hmm… I say, uh--
-[Nanno] I'm not good at it.

306
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Your Dad is the expert.

307
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,160
He taught me so many difficult positions.

308
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,360
Completely tired me out, didn't you?

309
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
[chuckling]

310
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,720
Not really. Actually, I think that…
you acquired a lot of experience already.

311
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,000
[Vaew] Don't be humble, Nanno.

312
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,440
Nanno is very smart, Mom.

313
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,760
She helped me with some
of my really hard homework just now.

314
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,960
What was the homework subject
that she help you with?

315
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,800
[Vaew] It was the essay
about my role model.

316
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,360
[Wan] Thank you, Nanno.
I read it and it was really great.

317
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
It's not a problem at all.

318
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,760
What Vaew had written was already good.

319
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,960
I almost cried while I was reading it.

320
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,480
You're lucky you have
such an amazing father.

Whenever you're available,
how about you tutor Vaew?

[Wan] Win and I had been so busy lately.
Both of us are always working late.

327
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,760
Uh… Hey, Wan, I don't think…
That won't be necessary at all.

Nanno's very busy with her homework.

329

[Wan] But I wouldn't make her
come every day.

if she's available.

[Wan] It's not a big deal, Win.

Right, Nanno?

No, I'd love to.

Tutoring Vaew would be a great opportunity

I think you're too dangerous.

486
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,280
Why are you hiding up there?

487
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,880
Without a password, you have nothing.

488
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
[Win] Come down and let's talk about it.

489
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,440
Even though I can't get to them,

490
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,040
I think I still have something fun
to show you.

491
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,560
If I know you, you'll definitely like it.

493
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,280
[Win] Vaew.

494
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
What are you doing to her?

495
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,400
What am I doing?

496
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,560
What did you do?

497
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,560
I'm not doing anything at all.

498
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,400
To be totally honest,

499
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,719
your daughter
seems to be enjoying herself.

500
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
[Vaew] Do you have a condom?

501
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,000
[Num] No.

502
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,719
-Do you want me to turn up the volume?
-[Num] Don't worry, I'll be careful.

503
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
[Win] I'm gonna kill you.

504
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,880
-Vaew, Vaew.
-[Nanno] Hello, Daddy.

505
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,679
I'm in the middle of a Biology lesson.
[moans]

506
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,800
But I'm almost done.

[laughs hysterically]

508
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,240
[Nanno] Num, are you sure
we should do this?

509
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
We don't even have a condom.

510
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
-Nanno, open it.
-I can see, okay.

511
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,800
You better come down right now!

512
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,880
[Nanno] Come on, now.
[chuckles]

513
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,800
If something bad happens to me,

514
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,400
you'll never find Vaew.
And God knows what might happen to her.

515
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,280
Where is she?

516
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,320
I said where is my daughter?

517
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,120
Maybe I should broadcast all this live.

518
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,240
[Nanno] She would probably get
a lot of likes.

519
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,040
Nanno, I'm begging you.
Where is my daughter?

520
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,680
You need to try a little harder than that.

521
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,240
Something like…

522
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
getting down on your knees and begging me.

523
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,160
-[Win] Where is my daughter?
-[Nanno laughs hysterically]

524
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,360
Okay, okay.

525
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,160
You did what I asked, I'm gonna tell you.

526
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
But I still want to know the password.

527
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,120
Shit!

528
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,520
Shit.

529
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
[Nanno] You really should get going.

530
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,240
Vaew is waiting for her daddy
to come home.

531
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,880
No, actually, her role model.

532
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,840
And if her role model daddy
doesn't decide soon,

533
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,760
it might be too late.

534
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,160
It'll be all over for Vaew.
