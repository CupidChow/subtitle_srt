What kind of manager are you?

26

You're so biased.

No, I'm not.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
It's only because O really deserves it.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,840
You didn't score one goal today, Teng.

-Come on, Bam.

-I'm the goalie.

And, Bam…

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,320
I scored one last time.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
You didn't bring me anything.

to meet up with my mom today.

That's so sweet.

[Teng] Por.

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,920
When do you think Coach is bringing in
the new manager?

-[Por] There's a new one?
-Oh, yes

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,400
And they're supposed to be
very, very professional.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,360
[Por] That's the best news
I've heard all day.

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm sure they won't play favorites.

-Like Bam does.
-[laughing]

59

They should hurry up.
I'm sick and tired of her.

-That's true.

Here's the new manager.

[Por] Right.

[Vinai] Bam, take care of Nanno.

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
She's new.

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
She's in the same year as you.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
She's not in my class.

73

[Teng clears throat]
Coach.

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,280

[giggling]

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,520
[Nanno] So what drives a human the most…

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
is hatred.

[main theme music]

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Hey.

-Okay, okay. I will.
-What's wrong?

83
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,440
-Nanno, dear.
-Yes?

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,240
I heard that you were the manager
of your previous school's team.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,600
Is that true?

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,400
-That's right. Yeah.
-[Por] Wow.

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,160
What kind of manager are you,
if you don't mind me asking?

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,440
The scary, fear-mongering kind,

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
or the loving, caring kind?

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,800
-Be honest, yeah?
-I'm… fine with anything.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,480
As long as she's not biased.

It's my first day
and you're paying for my meal.

95

I should be the one who pays for yours.

It's our duty. It's…

a warm welcome, okay?

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,000
Are you a Neanderthal or something?

169
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,960
Neanderthals didn't use paper.

170

[Bam's sister]
"Neanderthals didn't use paper."

171
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Anyway…

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,720
the episode you posted last week
got a lot of compliments.

173
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,040
You're getting popular!

174
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
There's one comment that I really like.

175
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,120
It says…

176
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
"Boring as shit."
[laughing]

177
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
-Stop it.
-Why?

178
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,800
Does it hurt your feelings?

179
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
[blower whirring]

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I'M IN EUPHORIA. I LOVE IT. WRITE MORE.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,960
"THE VOICE THAT UNDID HER." AWESOME.

[scoffs]

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,640
[Bam] Today, O scored a goal.

184
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,880
He's so good and talented and kind.

185
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
He's such a cutie.

186
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
When he turned to look at his fans,

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,560
my palms were sweating.

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,280
But then a new girl arrived.

189
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,320
Her name is Nanno.

190
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,560
What an irritating bitch.

191
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,080
She's going to be my co-manager.

192
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,280
She's literally the worst.

193
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,000
So I wrote shit about her
on the bathroom wall,

194
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
and guess what?

195
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,640
She saw it.

196
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,000
That was satisfying.

197
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,480
I hope she doesn't last the week.

198
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,800
I can't stand her.

199
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
She acts like she's so pretty.

200
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,840
Teng and Por kept staring at her.

201
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,640
They can all go to hell.

202

[phone vibrates]

203
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
PLEASE HELP NANNO SETTLE IN.

205
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,880

Go and wash them right now.

Help the defense after passing the ball.

234
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm a winger. I have to be at the front.

235
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
I can't take them all by ourselves.

-Tell the other defenders.
-Just listen to me next time.

-Stop it now.
-Why does it stink so bad?

Something stinks.

Are you saying that Nanno farted?

See?

245
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,520
Nanno would never do something like that.

You're just jealous because

we like the new girl more than you.

Is this what I get for offering to help?
