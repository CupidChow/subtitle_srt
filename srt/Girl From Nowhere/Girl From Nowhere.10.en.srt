who always encourage students
to seek knowledge.

They plant a seed
so it will become strong like trees.

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,960
Even when they're tired, they never stop
working for the students.

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,440
They stick with the right discipline
to find the principle of education.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,280
They are the role models
for being good citizens of the earth.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
They make us believe in a better world.

Today, as we throw
our farewell party for Kwan,

00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,840
we will also announce the winner
of the best teacher award this year,

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,160
who will also be named
the new deputy director.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,800
This award goes to…

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Excuse me, Aum.

[female student] mom wanted me
to give you this. It's a hand cream.

Sure. See you in class.

-Yes?

You were almost late today.

My girlfriend and I stayed up late.
We started watching a new TV show.

[Pim chuckles]

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,480
And what about you?
Do you have any TV shows you like?

I have no time for that.

[Man] I thought as much.

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
All you do is work, right?

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't mind working hard. I like it.

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,400
But it's ridiculous
for us to stand here like this.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Like you know,

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,440
greeting the students is a great ways
to teach them good manners.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Is it still good manners
if they're forced to do it?

[director] Good morning,
teachers and students.

45
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I have an important announcement
for everyone this morning.

46
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,000
After this academic year, Kwan,
our deputy director, will retire.

47
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,240
Our school will throw her
a retirement party at the end of the year.

48
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,240
There's another announcement
I want to make.

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,440
Our school has conducted
a survey of the students.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,080
It can't be denied by anyone
that there is one question

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,040
in particular on this survey,
that everyone seems to be interested in.

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,760
will receive a special prize

We'd like to thank, in particular,

for sponsoring this award.

along with a cash prize of 30,000 baht.

Yes?

Did you enjoy the volunteer camp
in Chiang Rai?

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Ah, it was fun. The weather was so nice.

64
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,240
Please thank your dad for sponsoring us.

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,960
Sure. I will tell him you said it.

66
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,080
But tell us how it was.

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,080
At first, I thought it was going to be
a hard journey

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,440
since the plantation was so far away.

69

But your dad prepared
amazing transportation and housing for us.

Also, the locals cooked us every meal
and they were delicious.

don't be late and don't skip class.

Can anyone solve this first problem?

86
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
And how many methods
can we use to solve it?

87
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
I don't know how to solve it.

But I just wanna ask you

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
if you liked the volunteer camp
in Chiang Rai.

90

It's way too hard.

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,320
It's not like we'll ever use it
in real life.

[Aum] I think
you are underestimating physics.

96

But that's not news.

Can anyone answer Chin's question?

100
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,360
How about the nuclear power plants
in Fukushima, or Chernobyl?

101
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,880
In North Korea,
they're testing nuclear weapons.

If we can understand physics,

there will be no coincidences
in this world.

Yeah, look what you have done, big mouth.

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,440
Can anyone use a different method
to solve this problem?

108
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,080
Come on, ma'am.

109
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,240

what's on the board.

You wanna find a different method?

111

That's okay.

This will be the homework for tonight.

113
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,320
I want everyone to solve this problem,
but use at least one different method.

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,960
And Chin,

115
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,080
you have a special assignment.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,159
But, ma'am…

117
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Don't you think it's a little unfair
to give me extra work like that?

118
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,960
You just have to write a report
on the role of physics in our lives.

119
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,720
Hand the report in to me next week.
Do you understand?

[Aum] Great.

All right. Everyone, turn to page 40.

We'll start at question three.

That's because
you're being stubborn like this.

129
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
[director]
This survey isn't nonsense at all.

130
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,680
If we can evaluate our students each term,
then they can evaluate us as well.

131
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,200
But I think the survey is asking
all the wrong questions.

Well, maybe,

your harsh teaching style

134
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,360
might be too much for the kids.

135
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,400
Should I spend the class time
talking about myself,

136
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,760
and then feed them exactly
what will be on the test,

137
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,720
in exchange for tutoring fee?

138
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,680
[Aum] Would the students
like me better, then?

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,960
Would that make me more popular?

140
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
How does it help the students
if all we care about is being liked?

141
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I understand,

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,120
but our world has changed.

[director] Ultimately,

144
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,520
Aum, I want this for you

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
to change your teaching style a little

146
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,400
so the kids can understand
what your teaching better

147
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,080
and I want you
to be more lively, you know?

[director] Lately, you've seemed
really stressed out like you used to be.

Is something wrong?

150
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,280
No, nothing's wrong.

I've already made this clear to you.

He has no part in my life anymore.

My child and I are doing just fine.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,200
Well, it's almost Christmas now.

158
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,680
I want you to be more…
more engaging in your classes.

Try not to listen to them.

162
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,360
It's just that…

163
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I mean, people like to gossip,
you know that.

164
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah.

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,640
I feel terrible about Jade,
about your ex-husband, too.

166
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,760
[Man] He shouldn't have ruined his life
by getting a student pregnant.

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,880
I…

168
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
I apologize. It wasn't my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

169
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,840
I would like to remind you
that this is my personal business.

170
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Thank you very much.

171
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Right.

172
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
I…

173
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,080
I just want to apologize
to you about Jade.

174
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,000
[Man] I…

175
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
I shouldn't have suggested that he tutor…

176
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,040
You know, I think we should focus
on improving our educational system

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
so we don't get a student
like that ever again.

178
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,720
Don't you think?

179
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah.

180
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
[door closes]

[exhales]

183
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,160
[Nanno] Is everything all right?

184
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,720
You look pale.

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
You…

186
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
I saw that you weren't feeling well,
so I brought you medicine.

187
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,160
Is something bothering you?

188
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,840
I saw you were talking to--

189
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,680
You understand that we're having
a personal conversation.

190
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,440
Don't eavesdrop.

191
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,280
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,160
All I heard was that you were talking
about students in our educational system.

193
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,360
I just wanna let you know
how much I admire you.

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
I couldn't help but say something.

195
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,720
I don't understand why people
don't realize how rotten our system is.

196
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,240
It's all a huge mess.

197
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Teachers like you
are the only hope we have.

198
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,320
If you're done saying what you have
to say, you can go now.

[door closes]

[Aum] Hey!

201
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Where are you going?

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Are you really going to live
with that bitch?

203
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,880
Are you?

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,440
[boy wailing]

205
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,680
[Aum's child] Dad, where are you going?
I want you take me with you!

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,880
[child continues crying]

[Aum scoffs]

209
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,960
Mommy

210
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Do I still have to do my homework
the same way?

211
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,680
Of course you do. Let me see.

212
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,800
WHAT IS THE COMPOSITION OF 16?

213
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,080
WHAT IS THE TENS DIGIT OF 18?

214
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,160
And why do we have to do this again?

215
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,400
Because we must find the answers
on our own.

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,240
[Aum] That's right.

217
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Do you know

218
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,000
that a good education
will be beneficial for your future?

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,040
Mommy doesn't want you to grow up

220
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,760
and act like an adult who didn't get

221
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,800
a proper education.

222
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,480
I will never let you be like that.
Do you hear me?

223
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,320
Here.

224
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,560
When an adult gives you something,
what do you say?

225
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
Thank you, ma'am.

226
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,320
[Aum chuckles]
Good boy.

[keypad clicking continues]

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
Hello?

230
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,280
[machine beeps]

231
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,680
[machine beeps]

232
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,040
[cashier] It's 198 baht and 50 satang.

233
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,440
You gave me 200 baht.

234
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You still owe me 50 satang.

235
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Which high school did you graduate from?

236
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
Who trained you
to treat customers this way?

237
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,680
My problem isn't about the 50 satang.

238
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
You should've given me
the correct change in the first place.

239
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,320
If you don't have enough change,
tell your customer that.

240
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,560
Don't you understand?

241
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Do you want it or not?

242
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,120
[shouting]
Did you not hear what I said?

243
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,120
It's about you
not giving me all my change.

244
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,040
I don't need your one baht.

245
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,400
I need my 50 satang.
Can't you understand that?

246
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

247
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
This is common courtesy!

248
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
[Aum] Do you hear me?

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,760
It's common sense in business.
The customer is always right!

250
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,640
How did you even graduate?

251
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440

-You really wanna be with that dad, huh?

Why do you want to be
with a bad person like that?

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,360
A bad person
who left his son and his wife.

How am I not good enough?

Stay with me.

I promise you that…

272
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,640
I will never ever let you become
a bad person like your terrible father

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,640
and his mistress.

274
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
I promise you that.

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,440
I promise you.

276
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,640
I promise you.

It wasn't me, ma'am.
I have no idea where this text came from.

287
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,200
PROFESSOR FROM A FAMOUS UNIVERSITY
WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A STUDENT

Is he your ex-husband?

-He got a student pregnant.

[indistinct chatter]

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,360
He's a professor
but he got a student pregnant.

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,320
-He just left his wife and child.
-She was dumped.

Aum, I think you should spend
the day resting.

299
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,560
What happened to me?

300
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,040
You passed out after seeing
the picture on the phone.

301
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,880
So… Every student is talking about it now.

302
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
[director] I want you to take a break

303
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,240
until the news quiets down.

304
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
Come back to work after that.

305
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,800
That will be better for you.

306
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Just trust me.

307
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I won't.

308
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,800
I won't stop teaching
because of somebody else's mistake.

309
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,000
Also, I probably fainted
because I have been working too hard.

310
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,280
My plans to reform the educational system
will change everything.

311
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,160
[Aum] If I have a chance to be
the deputy director…

312
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
You put your educational plan
on my desk this morning.

313
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,960
Isn't that right?

314
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,080
I read it. It's interesting.

315
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,560
But I think our school
might not be the best fit

316
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
for a radical plan like yours.

317
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,560
Pim's plan to reform the system
is popular among the other teachers

318
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,000
and the Parents' Association approved it.

319
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,360
I don't want you to worry
about that kind of thing.

320
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm asking you to let go of all that.

321
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,160
As for the position
of the deputy director,

322
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,880
[director] I think…

323
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
there may be someone who is…

324
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
more suitable.

325
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,200

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
[Nanno] You seem so stressed lately.

329
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
And you stay after school every day.

330
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Are you preparing for a class?

331

If you're done talking, you can leave now.

Did I do something wrong? Please tell me.

334
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,360
Why do I always feel like

335
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
you don't like me at all?

336
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,080
But I guess it's okay.

337
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,440
At least, we are lucky to have
someone like you in our school.

[Nanno] It's hard to find…

339
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,880
a teacher who would do so much
for the students.

340
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,560
If you become the deputy director,

341
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,360
[Nanno] our school will be so much better.

342

Don't you agree?

That's all I have to say.

our school will keep rotting on the
inside.

And then,

children will grow up
with this shitty education.

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,840
Sometimes,

487
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,720
the people who think they're always right

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,960
are really the most pathetic.

489
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,800
[shouting]
Shut the fuck up!

490
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,400
[breathing heavily]

491
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,440
I did the right thing.

492
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,560
I did it for everyone.

493
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm a good person.

494
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,800
I did the right thing.

495
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,040
I did it for everyone.

496
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm a good person.

497
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,560
[chuckling]

498
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
I did the right thing.

499
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,320
I did it for everyone.

500
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,400
[gunshot]

501
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
[theme music]
