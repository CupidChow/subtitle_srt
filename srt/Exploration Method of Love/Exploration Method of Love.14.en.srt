1
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,480
What are you doing?

2
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,719
Is being hard on others.

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
I wasn't giving him a hard time.

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
As for you,

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,959
you shouldn't have

6
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,079
you can be so free with him,

7
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,480
but why not me?

8
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,239
Why can't I?

9
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
How do you want me to cooperate?

10
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,200
Sweet and warm.

11
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,519
We are just in a cooperative relationship.

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,040
There are no real feelings.

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm the same whatever I play.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
Highest peak?

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,080
Why are all you thinking about?

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Why don't you ask him?

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,159
Should I just ask him?

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
To ask him directly?

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,719
Never mind, just ask.

20
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,120
Where were you last night?

21
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,759
How dare you lie to me?

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
I went out for a date.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
What happened

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
get Zhang and his daughter

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,000
In the hotel

26
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,199
In the hotel where the students will meet again.

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
What is he doing then?

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,520
That made you sigh?

29
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm not sighing because of Lao Zhang.

30
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,240
Recently,

31
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,080
there's a naughty girl

32
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,560
she's about ten years old.

33
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,240
And very innocent.

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,759
She wouldn't write me

35
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,800
love letters.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
But what's troubling her?

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,759
You can agree to her.

38
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,680
It's a bit complicated.

39
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,719
I refused.

40
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,240
Rejected? Really?

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,560
♪ The sea like you ♪

42
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,960
There are

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,360
as you,

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,400
would reject

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,159
who's in love with you.

46
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,599
If it's that

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,919
between the adults

48
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,080
with what you want,

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
I could accept it.

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,759
But do you know

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
this kind of girl

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,560
who take it very seriously.

53
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,039
I know what you're talking about.

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,159
Now,

55
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,240
you only talked about money, not love.

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
Unless you know me,

57
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,719
let me ask you something.

58
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,199
How your first love girlfriend hurt you

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,719
hurt you so much?

60
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,879
It might not

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,039
It's not all harm.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
She's made me grow up.

63
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,759
She was...

64
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,560
If I wasn't poor,

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
to leave me?

66
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,520
I would never

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,919
I wouldn't be able to be what I am today.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
In short, I think

69
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,040
a man must first

70
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,319
he has to have career before family.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,439
With your words,

72
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,800
but the dinner is on you.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,800
Please, please. Just eat.

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,600
Xia,

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
did you watch the last shot

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,079
the last scene?

77
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,920
I saw it.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,160
Your sister's performance is fantastic.

79
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,959
Really

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,519
thank you, director.

81
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,600
You're a professional actor indeed.

82
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,040
Director, you're too kind.

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
Little Su.

84
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,279
Thank you. Are you free today?

85
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's have a meal together.

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,519
Mr. Mu,

87
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,439
I invited Miss Su to dinner.

88
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,199
You won't mind, right?

89
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,560
Not at all.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,079
Just as you know.

91
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,279
We are just

92
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,199
are just partners.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,680
I have no right

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,959
her personal affairs.

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,399
I'll get going now.

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,879
Let's talk over dinner.

97
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,519
I have something to tell you, too.

98
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,040
And I'll have Rash Fever.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,560
That's enough.

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
Repeat it for you.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
It's fine. No need.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
We're satisfied with your service.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
If our schedule

104
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Is not leaked,

105
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,560
we will visit often in the future.

106
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,720
Okay, no problem.

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Please wait a moment.

108
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
Your food will be served later.

109
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,240
Thank you.

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,639
This shop

111
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,720
used to be

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,759
I longed for the most

113
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,000
I longed for the most.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
But due to various reasons,

115
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,079
because of various reasons.

116
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,639
So is this your wish

117
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,199
when you were a teenager.

118
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,079
Most importantly,

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
you are the one who came with me.

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
Little Su, I like you.

121
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I'll chase you from now on.

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,399
Qin Qiu, I may not be

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
not really who you think

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,519
I think.

125
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,399
You look livelier

126
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,199
and charming.

127
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,199
I'm sure that

128
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,079
you're the one I like now.

129
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,879
Could you please listen

130
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,079
what I mean?

131
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,519
Alright.

132
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Actually, I agreed to come here today

133
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,600
so that I can

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,680
explain this to you.

135
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,040
What you heard is true.

136
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,240
But during this time,

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,879
my feelings for Mu Hulun

138
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,560
has changed

139
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
unconsciously.

140
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,879
Then...

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Did I apologize for

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,560
It's my fault.

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
Due to certain reasons,

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,879
I can't disclose my feelings.

145
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,519
So he doesn't know.

146
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,800
But from now on,

147
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,720
I want to be honest with myself

148
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
and everyone.

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
I hope you can understand.

150
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,279
Miss Su.

151
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,079
Thank you

152
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,439
thank you for your sincerity.

153
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,439
Thank you for your words.

154
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,639
Thank you for being serious.

155
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,639
Why are you so serious?

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
About this matter.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
I don't know

158
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,800
what is the reason

159
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,360
what is the reason?

160
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,920
But the earlier you can make things clear,

161
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,399
make things clear as soon as possible.

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,759
You have to catch it

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,639
don't leave regret

164
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,759
leave regrets.

165
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,399
Kids know a lot.

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
Forget about

167
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,319
about the diet today.

168
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,160
My treat.

169
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,920
Don't leave until you finish it.

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll take it then.

171
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,800
Here, have some too.

172
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,399
Mr. Mu,

173
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,759
mr. Liu of the mining company wants to meet you for dinner.

174
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,879
To talk about the cooperation.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
I've sent you the address.

176
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Yard No.6, Binjiang City.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,559
I didn't realize until recently...

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
That I fell in love with you.

179
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,240
I want to be with you,

180
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,200
will he be more strange

181
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,559
If I said that?

182
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,279
Too blunt.

183
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,480
If he can't accept it,

184
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,799
how should I explain it to him?

185
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,000
Sister Su, something bad happened.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm opening the door now.

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,639
Miss Su, where are you?

188
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,480
Miss Su?

189
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,519
Where are you?

190
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,440
I have something to tell you.

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
Fang Xie, how are you in the morning?

192
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,559
Miss Su.

193
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,799
I discovered a big secret.

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,879
I tell you what.

195
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,960
I didn't sleep until dawn.

196
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,200
I spent the whole night thinking about

197
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,320
how to explain this

198
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
to Mu Huron?

199
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,080
Not only

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,879
think of a solution for me now,

201
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,200
and you won't let me sleep.

202
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
Calm down.

203
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,919
I'll come in and tell you something.

204
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,840
Hurry and get up. Look.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,159
Get up and have a look.

206
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,519
To see what happened.

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,480
That day

208
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,759
didn't you turn to

209
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,000
the clue in Jinqing's diary

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,799
the information in Jing Qing's diary?

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Why am I thinking so hard?

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,919
Last night,

213
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,799
at midnight yesterday.

214
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,320
It seems that the one Jing Qing likes

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,639
Is not Mr. Mu at all.

216
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,399
She's going to look for

217
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,360
the man she likes.

218
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,919
Wait, how did Muhuron...

219
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,279
Know this children's song?

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
They often gave interviews

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
with reporters.

222
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,039
You must check

223
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,120
the information personally.

224
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Or your identity will be easily exposed.

225
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,799
Therefore,

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,879
that diary

227
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,440
of the diary.

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,919
This turned out to be a misunderstanding.

229
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,559
Don't you know what I was doing

230
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,879
I was so sorry

231
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,639
I will explain to him.

232
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,240
Fang Xie,

233
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,399
thank you.

234
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,200
That's very kind of you.

235
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,799
No, I'm not.

236
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Oh, yes. He's really mad.

237
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,240
What a cheapskate!

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
Who made you say so many cruel words?

239
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,639
You'd be mad too!

240
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,720
I should apologize to you.

241
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,519
What's the matter? It's so late.

242
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,080
I have something for you.

243
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,039
Why would you give your boyfriend a gift?

244
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,639
To ask for my opinion?

245
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,919
Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

246
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,480
Qin Qiu is your girlfriend.

247
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,120
He's just a younger brother.

248
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,960
For what happened at the door of the hotel last night,

249
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,840
outside the hotel last night.

250
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,840
Would you please

251
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,799
a friendly hug?

252
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,440
I'd like to save my youth

253
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,799
at a perfect ending.

254
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,159
That doesn't mean anything.

255
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,200
And it doesn't mean something.

256
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
A hug doesn't mean anything.

257
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,080
Even sleeping doesn't mean anything.

258
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,799
Is that so much

259
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,440
and what

260
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,559
and what does it represent?

261
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,720
What do you mean by that?

262
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,440
You're so open-minded.

263
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
I don't understand what you mean.

264
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,159
You mean that

265
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,159
to my business partner,

266
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,519
please accept

267
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,960
and most sincere apologies.

268
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,159
Before meeting you,

269
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,799
I thought my whole life

270
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,639
was dedicated to the cause I love.

271
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,039
Has never made love

272
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,720
a required course in life.

273
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,440
Until the day...

274
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,440
The tektite you mentioned

275
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
was first found in the Modawi River

276
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
In the Czech Republic.

277
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,039
That's why it's also called Modawi Stone.

278
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,799
In that strange environment,

279
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,840
when I heard you talking about the Modawei Stone

280
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,799
It made me feel more familiar.

281
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,000
And trust him.

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,039
But somehow,

283
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,200
my trust gradually changed.

284
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,480
Due to some misunderstandings,

285
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,200
they did a lot of wrong things

286
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,159
I said a lot of nonsense to you.

287
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:21,919
You know what?

288
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,000
I have no reason. I am just willful.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
I just don't want to go.

290
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,279
I kissed you in front of

291
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,000
In front of so many media.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,879
We're still

293
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,759
a couple show.

294
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,720
And take couple photos later.

295
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,840
What do you think is our relationship?

296
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
Of course, we are working.

297
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,320
I hope that we can have a simple

298
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,600
be a simple partnership.

299
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,080
But now,

300
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,679
I want to speak my heart to you.

301
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,399
Please give me a chance

302
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,240
to tell you my story

303
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
It's my story.

304
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,480
Alright?

305
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,000
Unlocked.

306
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,120
Sorry, I misunderstood.

307
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,279
You can now

308
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,080
can be told now.

309
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
There's nothing to be misunderstood.

310
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm the kind of person

311
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,879
that night.

312
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,120
If they didn't represent anything that night,

313
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,960
If that night meant nothing.

314
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,039
Welcome home.

315
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,960
What's the matter?

316
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,919
Miss Su, I was informed that

317
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,279
tomorrow, the last episode of filming

318
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,000
the show will come in the morning.

319
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,039
Be prepared.

320
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,399
Got it.

321
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,559
Unlocked.

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,559
I didn't change the password.

323
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,559
I can still get in.

324
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,920
We'll start shooting tomorrow morning.

325
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,240
It seems that

326
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,599
we can only stay here tonight.

327
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,519
I'm so sleepy. I need to sleep.

328
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,519
Be careful.

329
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,640
Is your foot okay?

330
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,160
No, I'm fine.

331
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,960
Don't you have

332
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
to tell me now?

333
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,480
I'm going to bed. Good night.

334
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,279
That's nothing.

335
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,200
Are you crazy, Mu Huron?

336
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,160
Alright.

337
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,079
Okay. Then this contract

338
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,839
that's it.

339
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,599
Done talking about work?

340
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,559
How are things going with your relationship?

341
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,119
Very smoothly.

342
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,799
Everything is under control.

343
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Everything is under control.

344
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
Yet you haven't announced it to the public.

345
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,279
Your work is not efficient.

346
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,000
Tomorrow is the last episode

347
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,240
of the show.

348
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,799
She can't hide.

349
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,279
Doesn't it count?

350
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,279
It doesn't mean anything?

351
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,200
By the way,

352
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,519
a big deal to me?

353
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,200
Why should I be

354
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
be scared like this?

355
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,640
He's finally awake.

356
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,640
How was your rest yesterday?

357
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,279
That's nothing.

358
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,920
Oh right, is that nothing?

359
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,799
Is nothing?

360
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,599
No!

361
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,839
Don't what?

362
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,720
Quickly finish the breakfast.

363
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,079
The crew will be here in a minute.

364
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Su Jishi, what's wrong with you?

365
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
What's wrong with you?

366
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,519
Calm down, calm down.

367
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
What are you waiting for? Eat.

368
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,839
Mr. Mu.

369
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,400
Mr. Mu.

370
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Well, since you and Mr. Su

371
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,759
move closer.

372
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,640
Alright.

373
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,319
Miss Su.

374
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
Do you need freshening up your make-up?

375
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,279
Don't worry.

376
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,319
We can start now.

377
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,279
Hold on.

378
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,119
There's something on her lip.

379
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,799
It's impossible.

380
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
Look, there is something here.

381
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,759
It's not clean.

382
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't move.

383
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,279
All right.

384
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,519
OK.

385
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,319
Alright.

386
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,680
Sorry.

387
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
Did you record that?

388
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,799
If you did,

389
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,720
edit it out.

390
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
I don't want the audience to think

391
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,200
little Jin is slovenly.

392
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,200
She doesn't usually do that.

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,839
I was too busy in the morning to notice.

394
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,680
It's my problem.

395
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,759
Let's start now.

396
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,039
Alright.

397
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,400
What's our task?

398
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,920
This time,

399
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,359
teachers of each group

400
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,960
hope Primary School,

401
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,400
kindergarten and welfare home,

402
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,480
to experience the life

403
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
with children.

404
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,599
With children.

405
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
This test

406
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,559
Is to test every couple's

407
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,640
the tacit understanding of raising children.

408
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,799
Is a charity activity

409
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,079
of our program

410
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,799
to enable

411
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,640
to enable more people

412
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,720
can pay attention to and

413
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,680
and help the kids

414
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,799
that need help.

415
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,680
I know.

416
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,599
That's why

417
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,839
these are your task cards.

418
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,799
Sun Village Children's Welfare Center.

419
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,400
The report said

420
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,759
you two met there.

421
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,480
You must know

422
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
with Sun Village.

423
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
Mr. Wang, yes.

424
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
I've told other engineers.

425
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,720
That's pretty much done.

426
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,079
It went well.

427
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,319
It's going well.

428
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,079
Right.

429
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,480
I should do this.

430
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
My pleasure.

431
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,319
Alright.

432
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,079
OK, OK.

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Follow me.

434
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,480
What?

435
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
Stay here if you want to talk.

436
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,920
Don't you have lunch?

437
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,440
Please have a look.

438
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,200
Thanks.

439
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,119
We'll have a salad.

440
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,519
And a creamy pasta.

441
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,200
To order salad dressing,

442
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,319
I want that oil and vinegar sauce.

443
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,720
For creamy pasta,

444
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,759
no basil, thank you.

445
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,359
Okay, please wait a moment.

446
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,160
Do you only remember

447
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,920
my own favorite food?

448
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,319
Or for all of us?

449
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,119
Your brother, your mother and your sister-in-law.

450
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,759
And some important clients

451
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,519
this is the basic training

452
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,880
as a secretary.

453
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,319
Come on.

454
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,519
You've been looking at me all day.

455
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,400
What's the matter?

456
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,359
Did I stare at you?

457
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,160
You stared at the back of my head

458
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,279
In the back of my head.

459
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,319
Tell me. What happened?

460
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,279
Where were you over the weekend?

461
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,920
I went to

462
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,559
class reunion on weekends?

463
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,839
I asked you about this weekend.

464
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,119
You said you were at home.

465
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,400
Gao Ling, how long did you plan to

466
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,559
when will it be?

467
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
I said I was home that day.

468
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,599
Because I...

469
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,119
Do you think such class reunion

470
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,119
and a girl

471
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,640
with his female classmate.

472
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
You followed me.

473
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,839
Why did I follow you?

474
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,559
What do you explain about this photo?

475
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,599
This is the photo

476
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,759
forget it, no need to explain to you.

477
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,599
I have no obligation

478
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,240
to explain anything to you.

479
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,200
The high?

480
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,200
I will reveal

481
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,720
to my brother.

482
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,440
Your brother

483
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,759
my ability to work.

484
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,400
My personal life

485
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,680
Is none of his business.

486
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,160
Just go.

487
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,119
Alright.

488
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,240
Sister Su Jin.

489
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,599
Hello, kids.

490
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,279
Okay, let's speak one by one.

491
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,440
Mu Huron.

492
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,039
I know that.

493
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,880
Of course, I remember.

494
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Of course I remember.

495
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,720
When I was doing morning exercise,

496
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,079
when you heard the whistle?

497
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,799
Follow the command and line up.

498
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,200
Now isn't the time to do morning exercise.

499
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't line up.

500
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,240
I got it.

501
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,359
All right, babies.

502
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,640
You want your sister to see the painting, right?

503
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,119
Whose painting is this?

504
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,359
It's so beautiful.

505
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,240
Chubby.

506
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,279
The Head said that

507
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,839
you wanted to be a police when you grow up.

508
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,359
Right?

509
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:06,839
Right.

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,839
Then you must have seen

511
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,720
many policemen

512
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
see their faces

513
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
execute the task just now?

514
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,720
I've got a mission for you.

515
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,359
Line up.

516
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,759
To the dining hall, OK?

517
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Yes

518
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,079
go on.

519
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,640
Line up.

520
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,960
Line up properly.

521
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,160
Straight line.

522
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,240
Move backwards.

523
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,079
Back up.

524
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Hey,

525
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,519
listen up.

526
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,799
Sister Su Jin and Brother Hurun

527
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,640
I bring you gifts.

528
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,319
You can get them later.

529
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,680
Alright.

530
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,480
Thank you, Sister Su Jin.

531
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,039
We'll leave it to you.

532
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,759
Listen up, kids!

533
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,240
Lockstep!

534
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,160
Come on!

535
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,839
One, two, one.

536
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,680
One, two, one, one.

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,720
One, two, one.

538
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,640
This is what Secretary Gao asked me

539
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,720
that Secretary Gao asked me to give you.

540
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,160
Where's Secretary Gao?

541
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,000
He went out for work directly.

542
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,880
You can have it.

543
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,000
Take it.

544
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,720
Take it.

545
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
It's so exhausting to lead a kid.

546
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,799
Thank you, Lele.

547
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,400
Is this a gift for me?

548
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
Sis, did you forget about

549
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,559
I used to braid my hair.

550
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,799
I was joking.

551
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,640
Have a seat.

552
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Jing Qing likes to

553
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,119
braids her hair.

554
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,200
But I don't do it.

555
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,720
Lele.

556
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,759
How about we ask this brother

557
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,680
braids our hair?

558
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,319
He's really good at braiding.

559
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,000
Alright.

560
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,680
Come on.

561
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,720
You really know how to braid your hair?

562
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,960
When I was little in the yard,

563
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,720
to take care of my brothers and sisters

564
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,839
to take care of my younger brothers and sisters.

565
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,519
Then Xiaoman came along.

566
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,599
Until her senior high school,

567
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,799
I braided her hair.

568
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Sister Su Jin,

569
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,839
what's fun about braiding hair?

570
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,200
Let's play together.

571
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,759
Okay, what do you want to play?

572
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,880
What can you play?

573
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,039
I know a lot of things.

574
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,359
Listen carefully.

575
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,279
You are all

576
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,200
a group of scientific expedition members.

577
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,279
So this area

578
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,480
Is our mountain area.

579
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,319
Your mission

580
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,359
Is to find the ore.

581
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,279
Set out.

582
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,000
Go on.

583
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
Be careful.

584
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,279
Okay, fighting!

585
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,000
Let's search for

586
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,039
see if there are any?

587
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,559
Sister. Sister.

588
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,319
Sister.

589
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,960
Let's play something else.

590
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,839
Little boy,

591
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,440
let's go find that brother

592
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
why don't we play together?

593
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,799
Great!

594
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,359
Thank you for your cooperation today.

595
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,720
You must have worked hard too.

596
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:12,960
We are going to

597
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,119
to have dinner with him later.

598
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,640
So I may stay

599
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
before going back.

600
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,039
Then we'll retreat first.

601
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,240
I have to go back for post-production.

602
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,559
The shooting is going very well today.

603
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,440
Thank you both.

604
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
Thank you all.

605
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:32,920
What are you looking at?

606
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,160
I find that

607
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,599
you are different from the usual.

608
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,279
Nothing is different.

609
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,240
Come on.

610
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,319
Don't you think

611
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,319
I am good at raising children?

612
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,279
My suggestion is

613
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,039
you should wait

614
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,079
after taking care of them

615
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,400
and then brag like that.

616
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
It's easy to take care of him and eat.

617
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Have a seat.

618
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,079
Have a seat.

619
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,000
Come on, hurry up.

620
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,359
Have a seat. Sit down.

621
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:01,680
It's delicious.

622
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,000
Fatty put his carrot

623
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,960
In my bowl.

624
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,519
She took my apron.

625
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,319
Sister.

626
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,160
I need to eat with chopsticks when I grow up.

627
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,279
Stop it. Sit down and eat.

628
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,640
Now, let Dr. Glasses

629
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
that's me,

630
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,319
and come here to help you solve the case.

631
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,000
Every apron

632
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,119
on every apron.

633
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,000
This one is yours.

634
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,839
It's your name.

635
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,559
Yours is on the floor.

636
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,359
Here, take it.

637
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,119
Chubby.

638
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,920
It's Chubby.

639
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,119
Where's the police?

640
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,079
Is not picky about food.

641
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,599
Kids,

642
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,599
you must have proper meals.

643
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,680
When you grow up,

644
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,559
be as smart as Dr. Glasses.

645
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,319
Hurry up and eat.

646
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,759
Have your own way.

647
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,480
Keep a low profile.

648
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,759
Chubby, are you stuck?

649
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,039
What's up

650
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,440
are you all right?

651
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,199
Do you feel better now?

652
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Eat slowly, okay?

653
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,000
Aunty Sun.

654
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,000
Is it because of you again?

655
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,280
Please leave.

656
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,760
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

657
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,320
Huron saved him just now.

658
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,599
Stay here.

659
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,840
How dare you come here?

660
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
What do you mean?

661
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,960
Who was that?

662
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,360
Why did she say that?

663
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,000
What on earth does she

664
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
what does that mean?

665
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,719
Stinking Kaolin. So wicked.

666
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,480
Xiaoman,

667
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,159
I'll explain to you.

668
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,119
The photo.

669
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,760
That one is my female classmate.

670
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,400
We are attending a classmate party.

671
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,119
It's inconvenient for her to bring a child.

672
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,239
So I settled her

673
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,559
to the hotel.

674
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,519
You were afraid that I would tell my brother on you.

675
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,039
I told him about my personal life,

676
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,199
Is not under your brother's control.

677
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,519
What I explained just now

678
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,320
what I just said?

679
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,440
Yes, I will.

680
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,679
I believe whatever you explain.

681
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,400
Although I didn't lie to you,

682
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
but you're so innocent.

683
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,920
What should I do in the future?

684
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,559
You're here.

685
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,559
It's enough that you're responsible for me.

686
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,400
Xiaoman.

687
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,079
Let's have a talk.

688
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,639
After we parted,

689
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,480
I swore to myself

690
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:30,880
before we have

691
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,079
enough financial foundation,

692
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,159
I won't be in a relationship

693
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,400
with anyone.

694
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,519
Why are you telling me this?

695
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
I'm different from your ex-girlfriend.

696
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,320
I don't care if you have money.

697
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,679
But I do care.

698
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,760
Xiaoman, don't you understand?

699
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,440
The person I am now

700
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,239
I don't have a complete

701
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,119
I don't have a complete mind anymore.

702
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,119
I can't make my partner happy

703
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,199
to make the other half happy.

704
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,360
Xiaoman.

705
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,360
You are very important

706
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,639
very important person.

707
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,920
I don't want to see

708
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,800
our relationship

709
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,960
Is going to be so awkward.

710
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,800
And vulnerable.

711
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Your brother and I are the same.

712
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,159
I just want you to be happy,

713
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,719
health and happiness.

714
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,159
All right. Go back now.

715
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,440
I'll leave first.

716
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,079
Gao Ling?

717
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,840
Because of you again.

718
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,199
Please leave.

719
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,079
What are you waiting for?

720
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,519
How dare you come here?

721
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,760
Hello, Aunt Hua?

722
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,880
Are you free tonight?

723
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,599
Here is the thing.

724
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,679
I want to ask you something.

725
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,320
That's great!

726
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,400
I'll wait for you at home.

727
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,000
Come on, Aunt Hua. Please have a seat.

728
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,199
Take a seat.

729
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,239
This

730
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,920
It's your favorite wine.

731
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,119
You can finish it early.

732
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,599
If it goes on for too long,

733
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,800
It will make it stronger.

734
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,599
This is Huron's favorite hairtail

735
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,199
for you

736
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:37,960
It only needs to be heated

737
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,239
when you two eat it.

738
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,679
Thank you, Aunt Hua.

739
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,280
You brought so many things

740
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,159
you brought so many things.

741
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,840
I'll buy you everything

742
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,400
no matter what a mom does,

743
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,679
she never finds it hard.

744
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,440
Where's Huron?

745
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,000
He's working overtime at the company today.

746
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,119
I thought he's at home.

747
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,360
Aunt Hua.

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Actually,

749
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,519
I have something

750
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,000
I'd like to ask you about.

751
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
Just go ahead and tell me.

752
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,880
Before Huron arrived at Mu's Family,

753
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
about what happened in Sun Village.

754
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,239
Huron.

755
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
She came to Mu's family when she was ten.

756
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,199
He's

757
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,440
the first time we met him,

758
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,960
he is so stiff.

759
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,840
My husband and I

760
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,679
your uncle, namely,

761
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,519
we plan to

762
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,639
to fund a welfare home.

763
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,719
Then I'll take Xiaoman

764
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,159
to visit Sun Village.

765
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,199
To see Sun Village.

766
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,039
That Xiaoman saw Huron

767
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,480
and she really likes him.

768
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,119
And you won't let go of him when you hold him.

769
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
When he came home,

770
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
she kept crying and screaming

771
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
to look for your brother.

772
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,440
My brother?

773
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,760
After I discussed with his father,

774
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,039
finally,

775
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,440
she adopted Huron.

776
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,800
When he first came home,

777
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,039
he was extremely disciplined.

778
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,559
At first, we thought

779
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,280
he stayed in the welfare home for long

780
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,760
he was shy when he was restrained.

781
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,559
Then I realized

782
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,000
It was because of his mental illness.

783
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,679
Mental illness?

784
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,000
About that,

785
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,760
has always been a scar

786
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,079
and it has always been a scar.

787
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,840
I promised his father

788
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
we won't mention it to him.

789
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,559
So,

790
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,199
I can't tell you.

791
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,079
Or when to

792
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
the scar in Huron's heart

793
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,480
the scar on his own.

794
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,880
Let him tell you himself.

795
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,199
I know.

796
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,559
Thank you, Aunt Hua.

797
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,960
Little Jin.

798
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
Huron has suffered a lot

799
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,000
since young.

800
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,559
He has a heavy heart.

801
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,639
After his father passed away,

802
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,599
he worked very hard

803
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,199
he risked his life.

804
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,880
I'm looking forward to your meeting

805
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,599
to help him

806
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,199
to cheer him up.

807
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,519
What brings you here?

808
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,599
I came because I wanted to see you.

809
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,519
How did you know I'm here?

810
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,119
Make a guess.

811
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,440
There's no need to guess.

812
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,639
Xiaoman must have told you.

813
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,159
I don't know.

814
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,880
What happened to you today.

815
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,480
I just came here

816
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,440
I just came to keep you company.

817
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,960
Aren't you curious about

818
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,440
why I'm like this?

819
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,480
I'm not curious.

820
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,039
Before I joined Mu's family,

821
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,079
I had been living in Sun Village.

822
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,719
Back then,

823
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,719
back in the yard,

824
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,960
In the Investigator's Office.

825
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,440
Because no one

826
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,360
other than the normal children

827
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,840
normal kids like us,

828
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:15,119
there are many other things

829
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,920
who have no problems

830
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,639
mentally or physically.

831
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,159
So in order to

832
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,519
to protect them

833
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,760
and protect us.

834
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,400
All our actions

835
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
Is limited by the rules.

836
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,280
You know

837
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,920
that I was

838
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,719
a very unruly person.

839
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,000
You have to get up on time in the morning

840
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,159
go to bed on time at night.

841
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,440
People line up when they eat.

842
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,880
Even to line up for meals.

843
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,800
I once thought

844
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:46,880
I wouldn't have to spend my life

845
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,280
by these rules?

846
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,159
Until Director Zhou came,

847
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,719
he broke the rules.

848
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,679
And taught us to play games.

849
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,239
Like the one we played that day.

850
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,400
Chicken vs Eagle

851
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:05,000
every class

852
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
Is only 40 minutes long.

853
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,320
He will announce it

854
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,480
tell him everything

855
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,599
about everything

856
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,320
about the class.

857
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,440
After the class,

858
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,199
to tell us a fairy tale.

859
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,440
Slowly,

860
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,679
I suddenly feel that

861
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,840
sometimes I don't follow the rules.

862
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,639
It was a great pleasure.

863
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,599
Until one day,

864
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,800
director Zhou went out with me.

865
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,199
Picking up rocks

866
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,320
picking up stones,

867
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,400
and fell off the mountain
