1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
One shot 116 times.

2
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,519
Card.

3
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,400
No. One more time.

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,519
117 takes one shot.

5
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,599
Caka Card.

6
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,560
No, Xiaojin.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
What's the matter?

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,319
Why are you acting so wrong?

9
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,840
Look for yourself.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,040
There are already so many.

11
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,519
I'm tired.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
I can't even lift the rod.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,760
That's right.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
She ran to 2 o'clock last night.

15
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,359
If she can act or not.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,439
Director, you know that

17
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,319
I took a leave

18
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,400
from another group.

19
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,039
I don't have time

20
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,240
to waste time

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
waiting here?

22
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,280
Serve the meal.

23
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,560
Let's eat.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Mentors, today

25
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,439
mr. Su is treating you to drinks.

26
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,199
Mr. Fang knows your hard working,

27
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,159
he's so kind today

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,159
and let me buy a lot of delicious food.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
Braised beef?

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,319
Roast mutton,

31
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,759
and your favorite fried chicken.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,360
They smell so good.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
My mouth is watering.

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,960
If you don't eat it today,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,439
If you don't eat it today.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,599
Xiao Xia,

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm not hungry now.

38
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,159
Please leave me alone.

39
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,879
Please?

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,360
Brother Fang!

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
What to do?

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Do something about it.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,879
Let's go for lunch.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,199
I'll sit with her.

45
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,240
Go on.

46
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,080
Uncomfortable?

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,039
Of course it's hard.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
It's just that

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,439
was going to be ruined by me.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,719
I shouldn't have

51
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,639
believe your words.

52
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,439
It's so hard to be an actor.

53
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,680
No one

54
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,120
someone has never

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,439
so despised before.

56
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:35,960
I don't know

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
how to face

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
the directors and staff.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,319
That's nothing.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,319
Our current position

61
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,439
after all, it's still here.

62
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,080
Even if they have grievances,

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,759
they might just whisper something to each other.

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,280
When Xiao Jin just debuted,

65
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,039
It was so miserable.

66
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,680
I remember in the drama,

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
she was the maid

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
the heroine's side.

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
Needs to get slapped by the villain.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,159
Many times.

71
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,479
They just couldn't pass.

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
It will be a big show.

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,039
Hundreds of people are waiting.

74
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,719
Director.

75
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,719
Personnel

76
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,439
everyone was cursing there.

77
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,800
Think about that.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
Guess how Xiaojin reacted.

79
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,280
She cried.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,039
How can you not cry?

81
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,560
The point is,

82
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,360
after crying,

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,079
do you know how Little Jin acted?

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
She asked Xiao Jin to act.

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
The opposite actress.

86
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,240
Stop taking the same position.

87
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,240
Really?

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,839
Close-up with a close-up.

89
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Together,

90
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
dozens of times.

91
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,160
The blood vessels on your face are broken.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
It's all bloody.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,279
For several days to fade away.

94
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,079
Jing Qing's current position

95
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,120
to be able to

96
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,439
by doing this.

97
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,600
I want to defend the position

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,639
for her.

99
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,240
Fang Jie,

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
thank you

101
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,279
for always being there for Jing.

102
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,160
Now that

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm here for you.

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,199
Don't worry.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,480
We will be able to

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,639
overcome all the difficulties!

107
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,680
Come on.

108
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,680
What shall we shoot next?

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,759
Next scene.

110
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,480
It's so easy.

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,600
It's the same as the previous one.

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,959
Is that you two

113
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,680
brother Fang.

114
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,600
Mr. Mu is over there.

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,879
He wants to see Miss Su.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
He can meet her if he wants to.

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,920
When he asks for help,

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
and make excuses.

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
Who does he take us as?

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,279
I don't want to see her.

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Maybe I should meet him.

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,040
Mr. Mu.

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
After all, it's the investor of this drama.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,240
Mr. Mumu has an old gentleman

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
an elderly gentleman here.

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,959
I heard that

127
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,879
head Zhang of Underground Courtyard.

128
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,680
Mr. Mu told me that

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,519
that Miss Su

130
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,319
agrees to meet this time,

131
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,000
It will fulfill all the requests

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,959
all our previous requests.

133
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,720
Really?

134
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,800
Hold on.

135
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,399
Shan, who were you talking about?

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,959
Director Zhang?

137
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,000
If it's not convenient today,

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,759
I think I'll find another chance.

139
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,079
Look at this.

140
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,279
This will be your chance.

141
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,480
You're so enthusiastic.

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
I will try my best

143
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,399
just cooperate.

144
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,279
Head Zhang.

145
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,240
Nice to meet you.

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,959
This is Su Jin.

147
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm a big fan of yours.

148
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
I really never thought

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,439
to meet you on the set.

150
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,000
Thank you.

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's very kind of you.

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,879
I read your paper about

153
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,639
your paper on the Quaternary crust last month.

154
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,519
I didn't expect that

155
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,480
miss Su is still so interested

156
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,319
In our geology.

157
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,519
It seems

158
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,680
you and Huron

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
are really congenial!

160
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
You can call me Little Su.

161
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,160
Alright.

162
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,879
Little Su.

163
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,079
I asked Huron to bring me here

164
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,079
because I have a bold request.

165
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,399
It's not about invitation.

166
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,920
As long as you ask for it.

167
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,480
Here's the thing.

168
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,120
Director Zhang's granddaughter

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,800
likes your acting very much.

170
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Acted as

171
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,199
babala Fairy.

172
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,519
Right.

173
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,639
He wanted a photo of you.

174
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,120
I have one now!

175
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,639
Is that right, Xia?

176
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,720
Thank you.

177
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:09,879
The...

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,319
Head Zhang, I...

179
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,279
Can I take a picture with you?

180
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,319
Isn't it too troublesome?

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,120
No, it's not.

182
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,079
Xiao Xia!

183
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,439
Come on.

184
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,759
Alright.

185
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,600
Come over here.

186
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,319
Fang Jie,

187
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,199
she's here.

188
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,639
Xia. Xia.

189
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,519
Mr. Mu, come with me.

190
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,480
Come on.

191
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Huron.

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,319
Look at the camera.

193
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,439
Three, two, one.

194
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,759
Alright.

195
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,120
Thank you, Head Zhang.

196
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,839
Thank you, thank you.

197
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
Huron.

198
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,040
Thank you for today.

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,560
You're welcome.

200
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,240
I'll leave now.

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,839
Alright.

202
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,759
- See you. - Goodbye.

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
Since your performance today

204
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,040
good performance today,

205
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,639
I'll forgive you for the time being.

206
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,040
For your previous reckless behaviour.

207
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,079
And reluctantly agreed

208
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,439
to agree to your request.

209
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
Don't you understand?

210
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,680
You met Head Zhang for me today.

211
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,319
I don't like to owe people favours

212
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,600
I don't like to owe others.

213
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,120
That's why

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
to help you.

215
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,879
Who told you

216
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,319
I'm the one who met Head Zhang for you.

217
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,279
Come on.

218
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,279
You're the one

219
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,000
because of Head Zhang.

220
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,160
How can you, as an actor,

221
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,000
as an actor?

222
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,879
You must know a lot about

223
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,879
many of my hobbies.

224
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,600
Right?

225
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,759
I knew Mr. Mu was narcissistic.

226
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,600
But I didn't expect you

227
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,240
you're this narcissistic.

228
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,720
As the acme of perfection

229
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,759
what?

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,360
Can't actors

231
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,279
geology?

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,200
Is that discrimination?

233
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,360
You know what?

234
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
All right, Mr. Mu.

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't worry.

236
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll take care of her later.

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,960
This scene

238
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,039
It's about you being bullied by your classmates.

239
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,000
You're here

240
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,039
when you were cleaning the blackboard,

241
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,919
someone threw chalk at you.

242
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,279
You have to act

243
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,519
upset.

244
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,559
Okay. Here we go.

245
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,159
Alright.

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Mute your phone.

247
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,519
Come on.

248
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,679
Take a trial shoot.

249
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,639
Ready.

250
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,480
Eighteen scenes, one take, one shot.

251
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,879
Hold on.

252
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,559
There you are.

253
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,240
I just wanted to see. Don't mind me.

254
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,440
Miss Su.

255
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,879
I'm in a hurry.

256
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,759
Director, I found

257
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,879
about the formula.

258
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
I have revised it.

259
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,799
Don't pretend to be a good student.

260
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
It's the art teacher

261
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,759
hard

262
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,159
copied from books.

263
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,039
You're wrong, that's right.

264
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,000
Director.

265
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,519
Now this is OK.

266
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,960
Live art.

267
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,960
Director.

268
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,399
Please check it.

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,519
Director, let me check it.

270
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,080
Director.

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,919
Sorry.

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,240
We copied the answers wrongly.

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,240
She changed it correctly.

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,039
Sorry.

275
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,960
Be more careful next time.

276
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,679
Alright.

277
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,279
Alright.

278
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,759
Is just a simple

279
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,720
basic formulas.

280
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,399
If you can count that as a straight A student,

281
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,440
then this lady

282
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
your education level is obviously not high.

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,279
How could you

284
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,440
to say such thing about Mr. Xu?

285
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,559
In the play,

286
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,480
she played

287
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,080
an ignorant Big Sister.

288
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,080
She is afraid of

289
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,120
deeply into the character.

290
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,559
I was just acting the leading role in reality.

291
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,679
Enough, Director.

292
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,559
Let's start now.

293
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't waste Mr. Xu's time

294
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
of Miss Xu's time.

295
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,799
Come on.

296
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,320
Ready.

297
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Action.

298
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,120
Eighteen scenes, one take, one shot.

299
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,360
Alright.

300
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,159
One pass.

301
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,720
Alright.

302
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,039
That was really

303
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,559
It's good.

304
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,080
Very good.

305
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,440
Great.

306
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Thank you, director.

307
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Good for the rest of the scenes!

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,080
All right.

309
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,519
Miss Su.

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,519
Great!

311
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,720
Luckily, I'm quick-witted.

312
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,279
However,

313
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,720
I can only muddle through this time.

314
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,559
♪ Love scenes ♪

315
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,559
I don't know how to do it yet.

316
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,039
Why did Zhou Pipi

317
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,919
he just left after inspecting.

318
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
Mr. Mu said he had things to do.

319
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,960
And he left.

320
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
Who said I was looking for him?

321
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,320
My

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
my cervical spine hurts a little.

323
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,919
Miss Su.

324
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,960
Shall we ask Mr. Mu for help?

325
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,559
By finding the feelings for your heart?

326
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,159
You can't always rely on your clever tricks.

327
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
And muddle through, right?

328
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
Don't.

329
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,080
I don't want to owe him any favors.

330
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
I got information about Head Zhang.

331
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,519
His son recently divorced.

332
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,600
I can't accept that.

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,360
So she's hiding in grandpa's house

334
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,320
she refused to see anyone.

335
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,559
I haven't come out for days.

336
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,960
Is a personal matter.

337
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,039
It has nothing to do with the proposal.

338
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,799
No wonder.

339
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
Head Zhang cares the most

340
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
Is his granddaughter.

341
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,720
So he's not in the mood

342
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,679
for other matters now.

343
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,720
What should we do next?

344
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Without Head Zhang,

345
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
without Director Zhang joining us,

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,399
If your second uncle

347
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,279
pick a fight for you

348
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,360
In the board meeting again.

349
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,960
There is still another way.

350
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,879
I've been practicing with the teacher for a whole day.

351
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,960
I can't feel it.

352
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
What to do if this goes on?

353
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,000
There is still one day tomorrow.

354
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,559
We must be confident.

355
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,840
We need to believe that Little Su

356
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,519
truth?

357
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,480
Making a TV series before

358
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,679
before this.

359
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,320
Got it.

360
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,519
It must be the film director who has high demand

361
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,000
brother Fang,

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
let's go and beg Mr. Mu.

363
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,519
You think I don't want to?

364
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
Even if Mr. Mu has agreed,

365
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,600
It needs to be accepted by you.

366
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,399
Brother.

367
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,799
Mr. Mu.

368
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,039
Hello, Mr. Mu.

369
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,600
Miss Su is having an acting class.

370
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,960
She's having class so late at night?

371
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,559
Yes, recently.

372
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,480
Little Su

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,519
Is under a lot of pressure.

374
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,679
She has too much homework.

375
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,200
Please tell her

376
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,440
I promise to do the practice

377
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,639
to practice simulating love.

378
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,879
Really?

379
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,000
That's great! Great!

380
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,159
However,

381
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,000
little Su said that

382
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,919
she doesn't want to owe you.

383
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,000
This is...

384
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,840
You're certainly not helping me in vain.

385
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,200
It's an exchange.

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,919
She needed to do something for me too.

387
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,159
Mr. Mu,

388
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,039
could it be something

389
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,360
something strange?

390
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,440
What if she doesn't want to?

391
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,320
She's willing to?

392
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Willing to.

393
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,320
It's a deal

394
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,159
alright.

395
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,639
That expression is inappropriate

396
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,639
at night.

397
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,559
Look at this.

398
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,440
We actually

399
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
we already need something from Head Zhang.

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,759
His granddaughter

401
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,799
Is a fan of Su Jin.

402
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,600
Isn't it the best of both worlds?

403
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
So why not?

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
I see

405
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,519
by the way,

406
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,399
I'm really touched

407
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,720
he sacrificed for the company.

408
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,320
I didn't mean to sacrifice myself.

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,000
You said it on the phone.

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
My actual words are that I promised to help her,

411
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,120
but I didn't say I would personally.

412
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,440
I give my all for the sake of the group.

413
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
These are sweet scenes

414
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,440
love movies with high scores.

415
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
I sorted it out overnight.

416
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,120
Does this stuff

417
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,960
to work?

418
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,240
Will it work?

419
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,519
You have to try it to know.

420
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,399
Why don't you read it?

421
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,759
Then I won't.

422
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,720
After all,

423
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,399
you're the hero this time.

424
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,039
Thank you.

425
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,840
Good luck.

426
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,159
Go back to your work.

427
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,919
I'll make an appointment with Miss Su.

428
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,919
Domineering President.

429
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
Wall thump

430
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
ultimate.

431
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,559
You came three minutes earlier.

432
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,559
That's right.

433
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,519
It's a date.

434
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,960
We can't keep girls waiting.

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,039
You're fast in character.

436
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,879
I'm dating Secretary Gao, aren't I?

437
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,000
Why is Mr. Mu here?

438
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,200
The main purpose

439
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,840
Is to supervise him

440
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,399
and prevent him from affecting Miss Su's performance

441
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,159
affect the performance of the contract.

442
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,399
After all,

443
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,360
we are doing this in the public.

444
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,679
Mr. Mu is right to be here.

445
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,799
If it is caught on camera,

446
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,960
I won't give you any trouble.

447
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,960
Secretary Gao is really thoughtful.

448
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,120
The main purpose

449
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,279
the main purpose of this mission

450
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,159
Is to help you find

451
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,559
the crush feeling and state.

452
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,120
This bracelet can help you

453
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
can monitor your heart rate in real time.

454
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,919
Turn it into data

455
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,919
and visualization.

456
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,159
Good idea.

457
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,559
I'm also very satisfied

458
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm also very satisfied.

459
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,519
Secretary Gao,

460
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,559
thank you.

461
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,559
That's what I should do.

462
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,320
Secretary Gao.

463
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,440
What are you waiting for?

464
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,840
It seems that Master Mu

465
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,000
to complete the task

466
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,039
very urgently.

467
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,759
Then let's get started.

468
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,559
Secretary Gao.

469
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,079
Since it's a simulated relationship,

470
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,279
let's do

471
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:07,920
do the things

472
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
a couple would do.

473
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,559
Alright.

474
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,559
Secretary Gao, hurry up!

475
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
He's speeding up! Be careful!

476
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,400
Charge!

477
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,039
Come on, come on.

478
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
Heart Experience second round.

479
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,799
Love bento

480
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,839
can you feel your heart beating after eating this?

481
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,079
Please try this.

482
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,880
See if this

483
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,839
In this way.

484
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,880
In love comedies, it's called

485
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,880
play hard-to-get

486
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,960
let me give it a try.

487
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,359
It's just an experience.

488
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,599
Is it necessary to feed him?

489
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,839
Hold on.

490
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,000
You've eaten it.

491
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,119
I'm a little hungry.

492
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,480
It tastes good.

493
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's so beautiful.

494
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,920
Yes, it's nice.

495
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,279
But compared to you,

496
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,480
compared to you.

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,799
You can talk.

498
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,599
Let me have a look.

499
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,440
Put your arm on my arm.

500
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,559
According to my sweet love,

501
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,880
Intimate contact also makes you touched.

502
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,920
Really?

503
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,720
Is it cold?

504
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,559
Well

505
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,279
please wait.

506
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,240
Come on.

507
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:03,759
Are you feeling any better?

508
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,240
Secretary Gao can't catch a cold either.

509
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
After all, you are in an important position.

510
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you, boss.

511
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,160
What's your heart rate now?

512
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,799
It's not bad.

513
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,440
97.

514
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
Ninety-seven is not bad.

515
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
It's so slow.

516
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,079
When

517
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,119
finish the task?

518
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,200
By the way,

519
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,000
It suddenly occurred to me that

520
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,599
there is a document

521
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,880
In my office.

522
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,640
Secretary Gao.

523
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
You are not needed here.

524
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,880
Get back to work.

525
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,799
Well, Miss Su...

526
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,319
I have something to do.

527
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll leave now.

528
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,400
Mr. Mu will take care of the task.

529
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,599
Thank you for your hard work.

530
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,880
I searched

531
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,440
a favorite place for couples.

532
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
Home experience store is in the front.

533
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,200
It might be useful to you.

534
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
Alright.

535
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,279
What are you doing?

536
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,119
Of course I want to imitate a relationship.

537
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,119
We imitated other couples.

538
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,519
Just by looking at these furniture,

539
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,799
how can I have a crush?

540
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,039
You

541
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:17,759
call me.

542
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,759
Sweetheart, have a try.

543
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,079
Don't just stand there.

544
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,920
Shout now.

545
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Honey,

546
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,279
only 70?

547
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,079
When I first got together

548
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,880
with Secretary Gao,

549
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm still at ninety.

550
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:36,720
What about you?

551
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm normal.

552
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
When was the last time

553
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,599
you had a crush on someone?

554
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,079
I can't remember.

555
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,119
It's just that it's so long ago,

556
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,440
that's why I'm asking for your help.

557
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,400
You

558
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,240
when you had your heart beat last time,

559
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,039
when

560
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,400
last time...

561
00:20:59,319 --> 00:20:59,480
I...

562
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,720
I forgot it.

563
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,680
Forget about it.

564
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,640
You can't do it.

565
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,039
How about

566
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,920
please ask Secretary Gao

567
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,680
to come back.

568
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,640
I can't?

569
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,400
What do you mean, I can't?

570
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,039
I...

571
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,880
You mean Gao Ling is better than me?

572
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Was I wrong?

573
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,400
Look for yourself.

574
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,920
The heart rate

575
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
whenever I'm with you,

576
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,240
when I'm with you,

577
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,279
the limit drops down.

578
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,440
These stark figures

579
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,559
proves that

580
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,559
secretary Gao.

581
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,440
She's better than you.

582
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,759
You're better than me, right?

583
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,519
Alright.

584
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,039
Better than me.

585
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,039
Come here.

586
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:32,799
What?

587
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,759
Come here.

588
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
One hundred and ten yuan.

589
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,319
It succeeded.

590
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,200
You finally found

591
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,680
the feeling of my heart beating fast.

592
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,039
This proves

593
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,279
I'm still better than Kaolin.

594
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,400
And a lot of them.

595
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,160
The reason is

596
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,359
I bumped my head

597
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,799
that's why my heart rate went up.

598
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,480
It's not like my heart is beating.

599
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,480
Alright.

600
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,079
Since you say it doesn't count,

601
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,319
then we can change the place.

602
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
We have plenty of alternatives anyway.

603
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
I'll be with you today

604
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
until you're in love.

605
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,160
No need.

606
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,799
I'm a little tired today.

607
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,000
I want to go home and rest.

608
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,039
Come on.

609
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,279
What's this?

610
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,400
Give your boyfriend a gift again?

611
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,160
Not that I want to say, Xiaoman.

612
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,599
Is your pocket money almost used up?

613
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,920
Did he give you anything?

614
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,440
Alright, alright.

615
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,319
Gao Ling, cut the crap.

616
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,720
Alright.

617
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,440
Where?

618
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,839
I'll send you there.

619
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,480
Is that okay?

620
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,160
You don't think

621
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,599
I need to inquire about your boyfriend,

622
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,920
so you're being wary of me.

623
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,200
Hey.

624
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Not to tell your brother.

625
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,319
I never said a word

626
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,200
anything about it.

627
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,759
I didn't mean that.

628
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,400
Bai is afraid to

629
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,079
he's afraid to meet strangers.

630
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,559
I'll discuss it with him later.

631
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,680
I'll introduce him to you.

632
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,759
No time like the present.

633
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,880
Can you tell me where to go?

634
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,759
Baby, I'm on my way.

635
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,720
Did you set out?

636
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
Yes, I am.

637
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,240
White gourd tea.

638
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,680
Heng Long Plaza

639
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,000
I've got another big fish.

640
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,720
She is the daughter of Mu's Company.

641
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,680
Miss is very stupid.

642
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,720
She's called Mu Xiaoman.

643
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,839
She believed whatever I said.

644
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,799
That's so easy to fool.

645
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,680
She even asked me out for a date tonight.

646
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,119
She is more stupid than her.

647
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,640
I take the gift

648
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
then I'm leaving.

649
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,799
I told her to work overtime

650
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,319
and drinking tonight?

651
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,160
1912 Night Bar.

652
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,039
This way, please.

653
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,359
See you later.

654
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,400
Hey.

655
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,200
Hello, Xiaoman.

656
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,759
Is your boyfriend with you?

657
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,039
He is working overtime.

658
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,680
I am worried that there is no one

659
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,720
with me.

660
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,440
How about you come?

661
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,319
I'll treat you to a movie.

662
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:44,920
I'm busy.

663
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,759
You go first.

664
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,440
What kind of person is she?

665
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,400
You call him your friend?

666
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,920
Let me have a look.

667
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,000
Check it carefully.

668
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,160
A chick gave it to me.

669
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,279
Look at the dial.

670
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,359
It looks not cheap.

671
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,480
Come on.

672
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,839
Come on!

673
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,440
One more.

674
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,720
An overseas brand.

675
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,480
And see if you can recognize them.

676
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,680
Really?

677
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,160
Let me have a look.

678
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,279
I bought it

679
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,599
bought it from a counter.

680
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,319
It seems to be a real watch.

681
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,440
Of course it is real.

682
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,200
Look at you.

683
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,319
Inexperienced?

684
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,440
Speaking of which,

685
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,519
she really has

686
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,400
a little money

687
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,400
she was afraid I wouldn't take it.

688
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,319
He told me

689
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,480
this is worth several hundred yuan,

690
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,000
can I believe that?

691
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,119
That's not possible!

692
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,119
A couple hundred bucks?

693
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,960
When I go deeper

694
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,799
further with her,

695
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,039
let her get those

696
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,920
stupid rich girls

697
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,640
Introduce a girl

698
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,440
and we'll introduce one by one.

699
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,039
And get rich together.

700
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,559
Great.

701
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,039
Come on, cheers.

702
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,079
Come. Cheers.

703
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
Thank you for

704
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,839
thank you so much.

705
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,519
Nothing.

706
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,440
We are all drunk today.

707
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,720
What are you?

708
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm your brother who feeds you.

709
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,920
Or your uncle for short.

710
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,599
I wonder if she went well.

711
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,000
With my charm,

712
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,680
with my charm.

713
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,480
Coffee

714
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,519
thank you.

715
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,079
It will be the board meeting in a few days.

716
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,039
The matter with Head Zhang,

717
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,000
we should hurry.

718
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,640
Is Su Jin's play finished?

719
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm not her secretary.

720
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,400
I don't know

721
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,279
If she's finished.

722
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
Then I'll ask Fang Jie.

723
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,720
No, that's fine.

724
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,160
Go ahead with your business.

725
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,480
There's one more thing.

726
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
This seems to be a real watch.

727
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,759
Of course it is a real watch.

728
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,839
Xiaoman's boyfriend?

729
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,480
Don't worry.

730
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,480
I've taught him a lesson.

731
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,880
Show me your hands.

732
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,839
Very brutal.

733
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,759
It's fine to keep an eye on him.

734
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,680
Be careful yourself.

735
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,240
A little thing.

736
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,319
Where is Xiaoman?

737
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
Just doesn't want me to bother with her.

738
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,240
So she wouldn't tell me

739
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,920
anything?

740
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,039
Don't worry.

741
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,200
She's also my sister.

742
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,960
Just go

743
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
have you finished shooting?

744
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,000
Mr. Mu.

745
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,599
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

746
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,799
The shooting today

747
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,599
didn't go well again.

748
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,319
Miss Su was scolded by the director.

749
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,480
She is now depressed.

750
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,000
I'll come to see her now.

751
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,200
Alright.

752
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,000
Miss Su.

753
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,200
I've told you many times.

754
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,480
To have a more

755
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,440
should be gentle and smooth.

756
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,279
Is that so hard?

757
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,079
You're dealing with

758
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,279
your crush on someone.

759
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,519
You are confessing your love?

760
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,000
What is it?

761
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,119
It's getting excited.

762
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,880
And nervous.

763
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,559
Why couldn't I do it?

764
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,240
You know

765
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,480
you've spent so much time

766
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
so many people are here with you.

767
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,160
How much money you'll waste?

768
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,640
I told you to leave me alone.

769
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,920
Leave me alone.

770
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,799
What are you doing here?

771
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,200
To collect the debt.

772
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,119
Fine. Tell me. What do you want?

773
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,799
Don't pull such a long face.

774
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,960
I need you to accompany me

775
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,880
to see An'an.

776
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,559
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

777
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,559
Mr. Mu,

778
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,799
you think I'm your

779
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,119
as your social robot?

780
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,240
You can order me

781
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,759
as you like.

782
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,960
Make me cry if you ask me to,

783
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,039
make me laugh or cry.

784
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,160
Isn't that

785
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,119
agreed on?

786
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,319
I'll help you find the feelings.

787
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,839
You keep me company?

788
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,680
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

789
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,119
I remember that your task

790
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,119
hasn't been completed.

791
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,240
Miss Su,

792
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,799
If I remember correctly,

793
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,799
you seemed to be the one

794
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,960
who stopped the car.

795
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,200
An's parents

796
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,960
just divorced.

797
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
She's not happy recently.

798
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,440
Director Zhang is worried

799
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,319
he doesn't know what to do.

800
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:44,720
She just

801
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,559
doesn't she really like you?

802
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,359
I want to go with you to visit her

803
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,079
and comfort her.

804
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,039
Certainly,

805
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:50,960
If you don't want to.

806
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
Forget what I said.

807
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,359
Alright.

808
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,079
Leave it to me.

809
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,160
Be happy.

810
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,319
For affecting the mission.

811
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,960
You're the one who's asking for my help.

812
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,200
Brother Fang,

813
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,079
mr. Mu, you really have a way.

814
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,240
He managed to convince Little Su

815
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,920
he managed to convince Little Su to go.

816
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,039
I hope I can change something a little bit.

817
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,240
Can make her feel better.

818
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,920
Do you find that

819
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,720
that you care about Little Su?

820
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
What's that look?

821
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:24,799
I just think

822
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,240
they would stand a chance.

823
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,720
Pretending to be real,

824
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,519
you're really something.

825
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,359
Eat too much salt. You're so free.

826
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,559
Are you sure that

827
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,480
to dress up like this to meet her?

828
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,359
Very sure.

829
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:43,920
Come on.

830
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,079
Court Zhang?

831
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,000
Huron.

832
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,319
Little Su.

833
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,640
Director Zhang, we meet again.

834
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,359
That's right.

835
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,519
We're here to see An'an.

836
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:06,920
Come on.

837
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,599
Take a seat inside.

838
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,880
Please.

839
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,119
Are you the real Fairy Teacher?

840
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,079
Of course I am.

841
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,640
The real Miss Fairy.

842
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,440
If you don't believe it,

843
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
you can feel it

844
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,200
grandpa is

845
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,000
this child

846
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,119
her parents

847
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,119
had little time for her.

848
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,160
So you can see that

849
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,319
safe now.

850
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,440
This Fairy Tale dress

851
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,279
Is for you.

852
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,200
Do you like it

853
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,920
the fairy dress.

854
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,920
Then,

855
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
put on your beautiful fairy dress.

856
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,720
After that, I'll take you out to play.

857
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Alright?

858
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,079
Alright.

859
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,920
I'll take you to change.

860
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,039
Come on.

861
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:56,480
Alright.

862
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,599
I'm off.

863
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,279
Mr. Mu, you've been

864
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,680
doing the homework indeed.

865
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,559
And low profile.

866
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,599
I hope when

867
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,279
when you look after the kids,

868
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
don't drop the ball either.

869
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,640
Certainly.

870
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,200
Alright.

871
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,680
I need to change this outfit.

872
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I really can't stand it.

873
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,240
Come on, get ready to sit down.

874
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,920
Three, two, one.

875
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,640
Move out.

876
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,599
Three, two, one.

877
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,000
Slowly. Slowly.

878
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,559
Sister, come down!

879
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,839
Suyu, come down.

880
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,279
Alright.

881
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,599
Sister is coming.

882
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,880
Three, two, one.

883
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,239
Thank you.

884
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,119
Sister Jin.

885
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,960
I have a secret to tell you.

886
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,840
Alright.

887
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,519
Little Jin.

888
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,119
I'm so happy today.

889
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,880
I really like you.

890
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,360
Come here.

891
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
Come here.

892
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,559
Alright.

893
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,760
Grandpa will be here soon.

894
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
To take you home.

895
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,360
Little Jin.

896
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,880
I'm going home.

897
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,280
How about this?

898
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
I'll tell you a secret as well.

899
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,239
Go now.

900
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,920
Just go.

901
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,719
I also like you.

902
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,559
Are you tired?

903
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,039
Come on.

904
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,840
Have some water, OK?

905
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,239
Come on.

906
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:03,760
An'an.

907
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,280
What's wrong? An'an.

908
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,000
Are you not feeling well?

909
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,280
An'an.

910
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,400
An'an.

911
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
Safe.

912
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,280
Are you missing Mom and Dad?

913
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,360
They divorced and abandoned me.

914
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,199
-An. -An.

915
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,280
Here's a secret.

916
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,280
Actually, my parents

917
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,239
got separated when I was little.

918
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,159
But I'm not sad at all.

919
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,119
That's because

920
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,639
dad is still dad.

921
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,159
Mother will still be mother.

922
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,840
And I

923
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,280
I'm their favorite child.

924
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,559
I just have an extra home.

925
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,440
But I didn't receive

926
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,239
become less.

927
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,800
Really

928
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,639
certainly.

929
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,920
What am I?

930
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,719
I'm Seon Nyeo.

931
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,480
She won't lie.

932
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,920
Little Jin,

933
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,199
I trust you.

934
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,679
Let's take a picture then.

935
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,119
Grandpa will send it to mom and dad.

936
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,800
If they see you happy,

937
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,079
If they see you happy.

938
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:10,719
Come on.

939
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,480
Safe.

940
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,679
Three, two, one.

941
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,920
Thank you for

942
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,519
that you comforted An'an.

943
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,519
I lied to An'an.

944
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,599
That your parents are still together.

945
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,559
Except this,

946
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
everything else is fake.

947
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,760
I'll also tell you

948
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,679
a secret too.

949
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,400
About this,

950
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,159
any of this

951
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,119
to anyone.

952
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,000
Actually,

953
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,199
I'm really a sharpshooter.

954
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,719
He's not funny at all.

955
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,840
I'd like to say something first.

956
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,639
It's been three months since Mr. Mu proposed

957
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,960
proposed to Director Mu.

958
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,320
So far,

959
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,440
we haven't found any authoritative experts

960
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,000
to provide us with technical support.

961
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,440
For that reason,

962
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,400
I suggest that

963
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
the project is postponed.

964
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,480
And reduce the group's expenditure.

965
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,599
I agree.

966
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,719
You agree?

967
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,920
Court Zhang.

968
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,960
Hello

969
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,000
director Zhang.

970
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,880
See each other again.

971
00:38:59,039 --> 00:38:59,639
See you again.

972
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,360
Nice to meet you.

973
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,159
Have a seat.

974
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,159
I called you here today

975
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,039
to announce to you that

976
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,039
head Zhang has agreed

977
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,519
to become the technical advisor

978
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,519
of Mu's Group.

979
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,719
Mr. Mu, thank you for trusting me.

980
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,079
I've always been reluctant

981
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,360
being the technical consultant of the company.

982
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,880
That enterprise

983
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,280
only aims

984
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
as its only goal.

985
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:24,880
Of course,

986
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,599
this is also

987
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,960
my personal concern.

988
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,599
But I didn't expect that

989
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,800
mr. Mu made such a plan

990
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
In such a comprehensive way.

991
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,920
In the Chamber of Deputies.

992
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,960
Courtyard Zhang,

993
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,199
In the future,

994
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,559
In the future.

995
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,599
Dean Zhang is really a hero.

996
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,320
Congratulations to you

997
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,920
congratulations.

998
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,119
Congratulations.

999
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,000
Alright.

1000
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,119
Miss Su, it's time to start.

1001
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,840
It's coming.

1002
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,639
I also like you.

1003
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,960
I firmly took every step

1004
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,599
was to get closer to you.

1005
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,679
I can't hide...

1006
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,719
My love for you anymore.

1007
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,679
That's the feeling.

1008
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,400
Keep it there.

1009
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,039
Close-up. Hurry.

1010
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,360
Alright.

1011
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,920
Pass.

1012
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:58,960
Pass.

1013
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,960
Very good.

1014
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:00,800
Great.

1015
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,599
Passed.

1016
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,159
Very well.

1017
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,320
Little Jin.

1018
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,679
Jin, your performance just now

1019
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
you could put the audience in the situation instantly.

1020
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,880
Thank you, director.

1021
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,960
Thank you all.

1022
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,159
You've worked hard.

1023
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,119
Thank you all.

1024
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
Please take a short break.

1025
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,000
Miss Su will invite you

1026
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
coffee to everyone later.

1027
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,639
Thank you.

1028
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,199
Mr. Mu, what brings you here?

1029
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,639
To check my work.

1030
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,440
I thought I would waste more time

1031
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,719
on you.

1032
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,840
Thank you so much.

1033
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,440
But in the future,

1034
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,639
In the future.

1035
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,719
I won't give you the chance

1036
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,119
to look down on me.

1037
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,639
Although it's impossible to always

1038
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,960
I could not be so perfect every time,

1039
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,800
but I can promise you that

1040
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,559
I will only become better.

1041
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:45,559
Be careful

1042
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,480
I firmly took every step

1043
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,840
was to get closer to you.

1044
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,039
I can't hide...

1045
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,119
My love for you anymore.

1046
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,239
Why does my heart beat faster

1047
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,840
whenever I think of her?
