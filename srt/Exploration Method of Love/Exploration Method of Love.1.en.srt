1
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Today

2
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,039
Is an important day.

3
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,039
After a bout of ups and downs

4
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,280
and dramatic love story,

5
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,520
mr. Mu and Miss Su

6
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,680
are finally joining hands

7
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,400
for their happy ending.

8
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,759
Thank you, relatives and friends, for coming.

9
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,560
Tonight,

10
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,319
we'll witness together

11
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
their two

12
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,439
for the two of them.

13
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,520
It's your idea, isn't it?

14
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,919
What about

15
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,000
with my performance?

16
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,479
Let's give them

17
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,719
best wishes to them again.

18
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,919
What about

19
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,319
have you thought it out?

20
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,240
Of course,

21
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,560
so,

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,919
what's your answer?

23
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,280
Let's end the story here.

24
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,919
After all, our story

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,639
you were off the charts.

26
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,439
Are you alright?

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,319
I'm alright.

28
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,439
Let me reintroduce myself.

29
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,759
My name is Su Jishi.

30
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,120
A doctor of geology.

31
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,560
Than ordinary girls,

32
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,120
I prefer the life of sleeping in the wild

33
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,599
and dust.

34
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,039
And this one,

35
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,639
to explore the truth of the universe.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
Dreams that

37
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
you all hold on to it.

38
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360
After surveying this area,

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,480
this highland geopark,

40
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,720
your summer camp abroad

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,439
Is almost over.

42
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Follow me.

43
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,759
It's in powder form.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,399
It's an amorphous rock.

45
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,000
Completely faded.

46
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,160
Of high weathering degree.

47
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,560
Attention, everyone.

48
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,439
The weathering of the rocks here varies.

49
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,240
Be careful when

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,879
cAUTION

51
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,839
alright.

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,560
Miss Su.

53
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,519
This is the last part

54
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,720
for today.

55
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,439
How about we take a group photo?

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,959
Alright.

57
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,959
Professor Su.

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,439
Up close?

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,959
You really look like my favorite actor.

60
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,839
The popular actor Su Jin.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,879
You're really good at chatting.

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Flattery will not improve

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
won't improve your internship report.

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,279
It's the same.

65
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,079
If you don't believe me, look for yourself.

66
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,079
There's a mole

67
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,279
on Su Jin's face.

68
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,439
It's just that Miss Su

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,399
It's not...

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Alright.

71
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,079
Aren't we going to take a picture?

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
Let's go to the top of the mountain.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,040
The view over there is good.

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,439
The view here is amazing.

75
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,920
Let's take photos here.

76
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,639
Be careful

77
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,959
everyone, move back!

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,560
Place your feet

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,480
on that support.

80
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,879
I'll slowly pull you up.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,079
Hold on.

82
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,759
Miss Su.

83
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,000
Is Shang Feng.

84
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,720
Mr. Su, are you injured?

85
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,480
Are you alright?

86
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,759
There are no traces of

87
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,439
of weathering here.

88
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,839
How could this be?

89
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,000
Under the same

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,199
under the same external natural conditions,

91
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,079
the thicker the weathering layer

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
the thicker the weathering layer is,

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
In fact, the more serious

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,639
worse the weather.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
Just now, in the lee area,

96
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,199
and found

97
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,279
the strong weathering features

98
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
of strong weathering.

99
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,759
And the rock you were looking at

100
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,399
Is that much thicker,

101
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,079
the weathering degree

102
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,720
must be much

103
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,480
than the things

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,319
and more thick.

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
Let's go over there and shoot in the low places.

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,199
Come on.

107
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,319
Show us your pose.

108
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,360
One.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,000
Two.

110
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:47,800
Three.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
Eggplant.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,519
Tell me about your class.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll come to you next time.

114
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,279
No, I won't.

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
You can tell me yours.

116
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,839
I will send it to you next time.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,360
Alright.

118
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,879
Since it's about academics,

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
you can meet up.

120
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,079
Your account is hacked.

121
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,879
Why do you still use

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,879
this old mailbox...

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,079
Sis.

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,399
How have you been recently?

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,079
It's been a while.

126
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,319
I missed you.

127
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,959
But I know you're busy

128
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,920
with the project.

129
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,480
So I didn't bother you.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,399
I encountered something

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,639
something annoying.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,720
So I plan to go out

133
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
to get some fresh air.

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
But don't worry about me.

135
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll be back soon.

136
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,959
Don't read.

137
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,320
May I know...

138
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,720
Is this Dr. Su Jishi?

139
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,559
Who are you?

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,039
No dust.

141
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,360
Keep the table clean.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
Details matter.

143
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,679
To make sure that the company

144
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,919
to be at its best all the time.

145
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,200
Mr. Mu.

146
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,879
Mr. Mu, thank you for your business trip.

147
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,120
This is the email

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
I sent to you last night.

149
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,159
I was afraid you wouldn't have time to read it on the plane.

150
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,000
So I printed a copy of it.

151
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,919
What's next after 3.12?

152
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
What follows.

153
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,039
Third line on page 17.

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,399
If you round it down,

155
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,320
Is 3.12.

156
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,799
The raw data is 3 o'clock.

157
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,120
3.124776.

158
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,679
This 0.004

159
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,639
May affect

160
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,480
the overall construction plan

161
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
load-bearing accidents

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
(such as when the machine is overloaded,)

163
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,000
And the mine collapses.

164
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,440
If any of these

165
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,720
happens,

166
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,600
when are you

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,840
you can dissociate yourself

168
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,759
by rounding things off?

169
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,279
I'll go back and start all over again.

170
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
This time she came back from abroad,

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,559
why are you so angry?

172
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
The Doctor Su you met

173
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Is it a man?

174
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,879
Crazy.

175
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,279
I've waited for two hours but no one comes.

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,799
What a time machine.

177
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,879
Is waiting for someone.

178
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,960
The salary increase report is not approved?

179
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,799
Don't.

180
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,919
This Dr. Su

181
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,320
has really gone too far.

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,200
He even made my Lunlun

183
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,159
for this long.

184
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:27,759
Cool down.

185
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,080
What about the banquet tonight?

186
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:29,679
I've already arranged

187
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,720
everything is settled.

188
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,440
I promise to satisfy your mother.

189
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,000
Alright.

190
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,360
To make sure everything goes smoothly.

191
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,759
Are the sleeping bags in the tent

192
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,279
become so soft?

193
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,480
Who's that?

194
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,240
What's up

195
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,919
who are you?

196
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,240
Who's he?

197
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm Fang Xie.

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,799
This is Shan.

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,679
Sorry.

200
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,480
Here you go.

201
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,799
Who are you?

202
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,039
Miss Su,

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,840
I am your sister.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,039
She is Su Dianqing's agent.

205
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
This is her phone number.

206
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,440
You reached her just now.

207
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,600
She

208
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,639
Is the artist contract

209
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,440
with our company

210
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,919
and business contracts.

211
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,440
And this.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
They are my identity card, passport,

213
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,360
and property ownership certificate.

214
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,399
Please have a look.

215
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,639
What do you want?

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
Miss Su,

217
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,120
we didn't want that.

218
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,039
We came to you

219
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,960
that's because of Jing.

220
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
She went missing.

221
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,279
What do you mean by that?

222
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,159
It means she can't be found,

223
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,679
we've tried to contact Nanny Su.

224
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,679
We couldn't reach her.

225
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,000
We can only confirm

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
they're safe.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Fang, don't look for me.

228
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,279
I'm just a little tired.

229
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,840
And want to rest for a while.

230
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,799
I want to take my mom out for a walk.

231
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,879
I know

232
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,080
you wouldn't agree.

233
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,519
So I acted first and reported afterwards.

234
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,320
I'll contact you

235
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll contact you.

236
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,960
Jinqing, what's wrong?

237
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,320
No wonder she would

238
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
would send me such emails.

239
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,000
Have you seen each other recently?

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,799
No, I haven't.

241
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,279
At the age of 8,

242
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,399
one of us followed Dad

243
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,519
and the other's mom.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Spent more time living apart than living together.

245
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,679
The last time we met...

246
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
Was the first time

247
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,399
for the first time

248
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,600
for a long time.

249
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,000
If that's the case,

250
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
then we can only do it.

251
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,440
There's another thing

252
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,879
as long as you can help.

253
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,039
That's why we came to you.

254
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,440
During this period,

255
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,840
we want you

256
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,200
to become Su Jin

257
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,679
and become Su Jin.

258
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,240
What?

259
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
My sister ran away because of you.

260
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,919
And I haven't held you accountable.

261
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,639
You want to plot against me?

262
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,679
Miss Su,

263
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,279
danger

264
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,639
danger

265
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,320
come back!

266
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,720
Miss Su,

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
you can retire with great success

268
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
you'll retire with great success.

269
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,799
It will take no longer than three months.

270
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,919
If Jing Qing doesn't show up,

271
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
all business activities

272
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,360
all business activities.

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,559
That'll be a problem.

274
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,320
Just tell her she's ill.

275
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,279
If you breach the contract,

276
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,639
jinqing has already received the contract

277
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,799
the following year.

278
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,200
Can't be activated normally.

279
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,399
How much will Su Jin pay

280
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,480
how much?

281
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,200
I will cling to her.

282
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,039
I want ten million yuan.

283
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
If you can't return to the domestic plane

284
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,639
after 8 hours,

285
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,919
the first activity,

286
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,440
at the cost of 3 million yuan.

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,799
Flight CB2225

288
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,120
Is about to arrive...

289
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,919
His destination was Binhai.

290
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,440
For the safety of you and others,

291
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,399
please explain it.

292
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,679
You had a girlfriend

293
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,279
to have a fake girlfriend.

294
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,080
To fool me?

295
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,559
Every clause

296
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,879
every clause here says that

297
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,240
clearly

298
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,320
look at the date.

299
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,639
And it's due

300
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,840
will expire soon.

301
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,840
Ask your questions.

302
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,279
When are you planning

303
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,200
to announce

304
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,320
you two are breaking up?

305
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,440
That's impossible, Mom.

306
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
You and your sister

307
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,679
because your father passed away early,

308
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,840
really colluded to cheat me?

309
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,679
And bullied my father.

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,240
His father?

311
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Mother.

312
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,799
Why would we lie to you?

313
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,600
Mother.

314
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,600
Here is the thing.

315
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,399
I was on a business trip abroad some time ago.

316
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,200
Besides work,

317
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,120
I also bought

318
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,440
very important thing.

319
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
Is the same as I think?

320
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,240
Xiaoman.

321
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
Look for mom's phone.

322
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,240
Where's mom's phone?

323
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,720
This...

324
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,679
I'll tell your aunt

325
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,120
of your Auntie.

326
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Of him?

327
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,799
To feed his aunt.

328
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,039
That's not true.

329
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,320
The real thing.

330
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,399
Brother!

331
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,559
You're really something.

332
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,159
What else can I do?

333
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,720
Go and inform Gao Ling

334
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,639
and arrange everything.

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,279
Also,

336
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
let me inform you.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,799
The agent of Su Jin,

338
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,000
that's right.

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
I'll take care of it now.

340
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,200
This time, Doctor Su

341
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,960
you really

342
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,039
greatly this time.

343
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm not helping you.

344
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
I just don't want to pay the money

345
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,279
doctor Su.

346
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,320
Please have a seat.

347
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,320
These are

348
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,399
Is your sister's information.

349
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,279
Please have a look.

350
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,559
Feel free to ask me

351
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,679
you can ask me anytime.

352
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,799
Are you ready?

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,080
For the next three months,

354
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,120
you'll be Su Jin then.

355
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,519
They look alike.

356
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
It's similar.

357
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
What?

358
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,440
Could you not be more like me?

359
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,159
Sister.

360
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,720
Alright.

361
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,440
Good girl.

362
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,759
I can't swear.

363
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,759
You know what?

364
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,840
I've already resisted the urge

365
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
to hit her.

366
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,879
What do you want me to do?

367
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,320
Miss Su,

368
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,720
It's hard, bear with it.

369
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,759
Your sister follows

370
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,360
Is the pure and simple girl.

371
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,039
As long as you keep silent,

372
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,039
the real Su Jin.

373
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,240
Come on.

374
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,559
Change our clothes.

375
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,400
It's so pretty.

376
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Don't be beautiful. Hurry up.

377
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,119
Can you pull the zipper for me?

378
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,319
Can you work wearing that?

379
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,480
One, two.

380
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,200
What's your size?

381
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,559
Is a size 4 too big...

382
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,559
She's a size 2.

383
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,599
Your sister is a size zero.

384
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,400
That's why

385
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,440
brother Fang,

386
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,640
xiao Xia told me that

387
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
the meeting was urging us.

388
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,319
We can't delay it anymore.

389
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,119
Well, this...

390
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,319
Fang Xie,

391
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,519
take off your clothes.

392
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:03,880
Here comes the bus.

393
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,640
Here she comes.

394
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,480
Little Su is here.

395
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Today's Su Jin's style

396
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,680
very different.

397
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,640
What's that

398
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,400
so many people!

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
I really turned myself in.

400
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,240
I haven't worn high heels

401
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,799
I haven't worn high heels for ten years.

402
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
That your sister wears a dress

403
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,079
she would protect her chest with her hand.

404
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,160
She walks

405
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
Is a little inked in

406
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
she likes to stroke the left side of her hair

407
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,559
and pin the broken hair behind her ear.

408
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:38,799
Sure enough,

409
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,119
food in the city

410
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,319
Is not as clean as that of the wild.

411
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,839
Hold on a little longer.

412
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
Little Su, you are finally back.

413
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,039
I miss you so much.

414
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,440
You have an assistant named Wu Danxia.

415
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,680
Xia, please

416
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,759
watch your behavior.

417
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,759
Lower your voice.

418
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Alright.

419
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,440
Take me to the toilet.

420
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,440
Come on.

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
It's inconvenient to wear a skirt.

422
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,599
What am I going to suffer?

423
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,480
Whether it's the Zhu Xi Style

424
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,519
or Shizhu Mountain Style,

425
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,599
for this area,

426
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,680
In this area.

427
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,640
Light metamorphic pyroclastic rock,

428
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
plus aeolian fossil and ion adsorption,

429
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,319
my thesis...

430
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:06,880
Such a combination

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,319
last year, we had

432
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,400
nine mineral deposits

433
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,200
9 mineral deposits,

434
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,119
and it's

435
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,319
about the latest

436
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,599
In the latest issue of

437
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,319
there is an article

438
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,279
the practicality

439
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,720
the practicability of this exploration technology

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,160
I won't repeat it to you.

441
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,599
Is clearly stated in the article.

442
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,720
I didn't expect to

443
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,599
to meet my academic friend

444
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
his academic confidant.

445
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
The writer of this article happens to be Chinese.

446
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,880
But I didn't expect that

447
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Is a female doctor.

448
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,720
Hey.

449
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,799
What's wrong with a female doctor?

450
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
She has to hang up now.

451
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,000
Hello?

452
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:37,640
This is bad.

453
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,279
This lady,

454
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,240
fang Fang said that we should keep a low profile.

455
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,519
It's impolite to eavesdrop

456
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,599
to eavesdrop on someone's phone.

457
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
This isn't to be eavesdropping in public.

458
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,279
What's more,

459
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:48,880
your speech on gender bias

460
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,799
such a brilliant speech.

461
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
To hear it.

462
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,559
What did you say

463
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,279
nothing.

464
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,480
It doesn't matter who I am.

465
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,960
I am only

466
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
an ordinary woman.

467
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,559
Hey.

468
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
I didn't disrespect women.

469
00:19:59,119 --> 00:19:59,839
On the contrary.

470
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,240
I respect the female doctors very much.

471
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,079
The social pressure they

472
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,240
from society.

473
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,039
You think

474
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,880
that women are inferior to men

475
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,759
In all aspects.

476
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,400
They're here.

477
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,680
There is still time.

478
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,319
By the way,

479
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,599
Is it that simple?

480
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,200
That's right.

481
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Follow my instructions.

482
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,319
Just say

483
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,039
one English word.

484
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,720
It's...

485
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,079
Y E S?

487
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,759
Look. It's Su Jin.

488
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,759
Su Jin is also here?

489
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,359
Look! It's Su Jin.

490
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,160
She's so beautiful.

491
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,039
That's the super star.

492
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,839
Not the right.

493
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,480
To the left.

494
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,279
Left, left.

495
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,079
Right.

496
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,039
Alright.

497
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,240
Go straight.

498
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,599
The first table by the stage is

499
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,519
now sit over there.

500
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:00,960
Little Jin.

501
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Have a seat.

502
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Come.

503
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,640
Greet her.

504
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,640
Call her aunt Hua.

505
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,440
She's your sister.

506
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
And very close to him.

507
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,720
Hello, Aunt Hua.

508
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,400
Come here.

509
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,319
Little Jin.

510
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Your outfit today

511
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,559
Is really beautiful.

512
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,839
Little Jin

513
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,359
living clothes rack!

514
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,680
Huron

515
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,720
must be really blessed

516
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,880
only your aunt

517
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:22,720
Is your auntie,

518
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,880
and not your Second Uncle, right?

519
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,359
Toast to your Second Uncle.

520
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,359
Greetings, Second Uncle.

521
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:26,960
Let's go together.

522
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,359
Come on.

523
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,440
Who exactly is Aunt Hua?

524
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,559
And who is Mu Huren?

525
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,200
Don't worry about that.

526
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,160
It's your turn.

527
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,480
The alcohol is not bad.

528
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,839
What happened

529
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
there's still lighting?

530
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,640
Come on, now.

531
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Hold his hand.

532
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,200
Follow him.

533
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,240
Just do what

534
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,039
just do what I tell you.

535
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,119
Call him Huron now.

536
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,200
Huron?

537
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,160
It was you who

538
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,359
and eavesdrop on my phone.

539
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,079
You

540
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,359
fang Jie, what's going on?

541
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
There's no such part

542
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:18,960
don't have that part?

543
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,000
Miss Su, rely on yourself.

544
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,880
Why do it seem that

545
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
from the girl I met.

546
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,720
Not really.

547
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,559
Why is your hand callused?

548
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
I went rock climbing the other day.

549
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,680
Why don't I remember?

550
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,240
It is said that she can climb.

551
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,799
Weren't you

552
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,279
you were best at this kind of dance?

553
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,000
That's Jin!

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
I won't

555
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,480
what's going on?

556
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,640
No way!

557
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,359
If this goes on,

558
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,240
will definitely be exposed.

559
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,480
What happened?

560
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,200
Why did you stop?

561
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,519
Let's sing a faster song.

562
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,400
What happened

563
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,200
are they crazy?

564
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,079
Let's get through this first.

565
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,359
We'll talk about the rest.

566
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,920
That's good.

567
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,759
What's wrong with her today?

568
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Alright.

569
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,440
OK.

570
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,599
OK.

571
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,119
OK.

572
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,000
Alright.

573
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,240
Thank you Mr. Mu and Miss Su

574
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,039
for bringing us

575
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,960
wonderful dance.

576
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,920
The warm-up activity to a climax.

577
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,000
Next, let's look forward to

578
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,400
the celebration party.

579
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,200
Little Su,

580
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,559
please don't be angry.

581
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,480
Don't be so angry.

582
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
Alright?

583
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,920
Who's Mu Hurun?

584
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,920
He's Su Jin's boyfriend.

585
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,319
How long have they been together?

586
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,039
Since the beginning

587
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,000
what you like about him.

588
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,559
How close

589
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,240
their relationship?

590
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,799
Why didn't you tell me

591
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,640
when you were in the car?

592
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,720
You never asked me

593
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,119
about your relationship.

594
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,880
Explain to me immediately.

595
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,680
Alright.

596
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,480
Mu Huron.

597
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,119
30 years old.

598
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,799
The CEO of Mu Mining Group.

599
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,599
Three years ago, at a private dinner

600
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,640
at a private dinner three years ago.

601
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,720
They liked each other.

602
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,240
The second time they met

603
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,839
was after a month

604
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,440
one month later,

605
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,480
he gave Jing a bottle.

606
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
The sea at the South Pole.

607
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,119
They established their relationship.

608
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,039
Sea water.

609
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,119
Isn't it romantic?

610
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,839
It's destroying the ecology.

611
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,640
What's there to like?

612
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,839
What is Jinqing thinking?

613
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,319
Isn't that great?

614
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,119
It fully fits

615
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,480
the status of a blue-eyed star

616
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,400
and the illusion of fans.

617
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,799
Think about it.

618
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,599
He's never been red-faced

619
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,200
In the past two to three years.

620
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,119
He even threw

621
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,480
sprinkle candies or something.

622
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,720
How close their relationship

623
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,440
their relationship?

624
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,200
Do you want to hear the internal or external?

625
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,640
Stop

626
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,720
forget that I asked.

627
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,519
This is much more comfortable.

628
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
Little Su, I was just joking.

629
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,319
And most importantly,

630
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,039
the most important thing.

631
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:26,480
Huron.

632
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,640
Second Uncle, after I found out

633
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,720
you know Little Su.

634
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,119
And your ability to show off

635
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,279
of showing off.

636
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,799
Second Uncle,

637
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,079
we just want

638
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,039
to liven up the atmosphere.

639
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,519
Come on.

640
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,079
To you.

641
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,640
Xiaoyu, I'll go get prepared.

642
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,319
Well

643
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,839
serve the elders with tea instead of wine.

644
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,200
I know.

645
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,559
It's your self-discipline.

646
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,319
That you never touch alcohol.

647
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Those you don't understand?

648
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,079
That's called arrogance.

649
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,640
Also,

650
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
I found you've been hanging out with women

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
among women for a long time.

652
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,559
After such a long time.

653
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,000
The first thing women need

654
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,400
are clothes.

655
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,160
Business is brotherhood, you know?

656
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,920
So, Second Uncle is single tonight.

657
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
In the future.

658
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,599
That such a joke between two men

659
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,599
you're a little girl.

660
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,440
What do you know? Be so rude.

661
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,400
That was a joke.

662
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,279
Alright.

663
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,039
Next,

664
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,480
next is an important segment.

665
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,400
All the guests

666
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
can look forward to it.

667
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm leaving for a moment.

668
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,519
When is the end

669
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,680
this endless activity.

670
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,640
Second Uncle came alone today.

671
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,960
Is he streaking?

672
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,200
Brother.

673
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,200
Which one were you peeking at?

674
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,319
It's the lines in the script.

675
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:52,920
Do you think Su Jin would

676
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,480
Is that what Su Jin would say?

677
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,559
It's not.

678
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,960
I feel that she seems

679
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,039
she's different today.

680
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,440
Who cares if she changes?

681
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,200
Just don't delay tonight.

682
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,160
Let's welcome Mr. Mu.

683
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,599
Hurry up.

684
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,319
This surprise

685
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,559
Is related to Miss Su?

686
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
You've become thinner and thinner recently.

687
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,400
What happened

688
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,160
you left in such a hurry

689
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
I didn't even have time to tell you

690
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,519
that your sister and Mr. Mu

691
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,599
Is cooperation,

692
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,559
Is based on a script.

693
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:20,799
That's why

694
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,839
this is the proposal.

695
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,359
Propose

696
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,200
propose to her?

697
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,240
Su Jin.

698
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
Today's scene

699
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,039
I imagined and rehearsed this scene

700
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,119
and rehearsed countless times.

701
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,359
Thank you.

702
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,920
Thank you for letting me know

703
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,039

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,160
not only because

708
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,720

709
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,119
and it's because...

710
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,400
For you,

711
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,519
what can I do?

712
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,079
Will you marry me?

713
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,640
That's right.

714
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,519
Agreed?

715
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,440
Agreed?

716
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:19,480
Agreed?

717
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,480
Agreed?

00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,359
Agreed?

719
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,400
Agreed?

720
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,279
Agreed.

721
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
Follow my instructions.

722
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,519
Just say

723
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,319
one English word.

724
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:30,759
Right.

725
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,680
Your sister and Mr. Mu

726
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,839
Is cooperation,

727
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,960
Is based on a script.

728
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,759
This whole thing

729
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,680
proposal today.

730
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:36,920
I agree.

731
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,240
It's agreed.

732
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,359
Get married?

733
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,799
Could it be that Jing Qing

734
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
to be controlled

735
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,680
at your will?

736
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,759
Or

737
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,400
who looks down upon a female doctor?

738
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,759
No, it's not.

739
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:01,599
Sorry.

740
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,839
That I can't accept your proposal.

741
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,920
Mr. Mu was rejected

742
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,960
su Jin rejected him.

743
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,799
God, this is a big news.

744
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,920
This is a bit awkward.

745
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,519
I didn't expect Mr. Mu to be like this.

746
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,200
Right.

747
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,920
Can anyone tell me

748
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,920
what Su Jin is doing?

749
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,920
Why did she refuse to propose?

750
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,480
Why did they

751
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
the waltz?

752
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
But those

753
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,279
all the crap.

754
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,559
What's more,

755
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,440
and she eavesdropped

756
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
I was talking to Wang on the phone.

757
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,039
And I was helping

758
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,880
the author of

759
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,319
of a paper I read before.

760
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,039
Mu Xiaoman.

761
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,079
You have nothing to say?

762
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,240
You've never

763
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,079
you never mentioned Su Jin

764
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,559
mentioned Su Jin in front of me?

765
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,039
No one?

766
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,839
It's not important.

767
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
It's your sleeping time.

768
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,519
And you're talking about Su Jin here.

769
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,359
Brother.

770
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,240
Why don't you take a rest?

771
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,240
Don't be angry.

772
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:14,920
Take a rest.

773
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,640
Tell me how to rest.

774
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,599
Please explain to

775
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
to her.

776
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,319
That's interesting.

777
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,039
Things turned out

778
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,279
things like this.

779
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,880
You two

780
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,039
one is to guarantee the scene,

781
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,599
a whole setup script,

782
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,920
yet no one knows

783
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,559
why Su Jin rejected me

784
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,839
reject me today?

785
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,400
I only

786
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,720
to write a love script.

787
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,119
How would I know?

788
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
To ensure nothing would happen,

789
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,039
I only deleted one sentence of this script,

790
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,200
that's right.

791
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,119
Brother Gao Ling, you can testify.

792
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,920
That's right.

793
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,119
Fang Xie also apologized.

794
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,079
He said Su Jin might be

795
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,319
that Su Jin is in a bad mood today.

796
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,960
Tell her to come to the company tomorrow

797
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,799
and apologize in person.

798
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,799
Brother.

799
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,400
Are you interested in

800
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,799
with Su Jin?

801
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,559
Cut the crap!

802
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
I will be interested in her.

803
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,000
Tomorrow, ask her

804
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,079
a reasonable explanation tomorrow.

805
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,799
Give me the bag.

806
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,319
I just said no.

807
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,759
For the compensation of 3 million yuan.

808
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,119
That is indeed

809
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,279
we breached the contract first.

810
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,519
This is the Jinqing family.

811
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,160
That's right.

812
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,279
You'll be hosting

813
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,079
In the next three months.

814
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,720
The workload of Jinqing

815
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,640
such a heavy workload, right?

816
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,000
Yes

817
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,200
a little overweight.

818
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,839
She started to be a professional.

819
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,039
She rarely rests.

820
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,039
No wonder she's under great pressure.

821
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,599
Fang Xie.

822
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,000
How much time is left

823
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,319
for Jinqing and Mu Huron?

824
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,720
There's still one month left.

825
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,440
How about we hold on to it?

826
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,359
What about the contract?

827
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,359
It's still five years.

828
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,279
Aren't you going to answer it?

829
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:52,920
I knew that my clients

830
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,200
that my clients sent me.

831
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,359
They must have heard

832
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,640
you rejected the proposal.

833
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,920
Miss Su,

834
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,839
If the contract is gone,

835
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,039
many things will be...

836
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,799
Will be totally different.

837
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,799
Jinqing has always been

838
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,320
since she entered the industry.

839
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,599
But in our industry,

840
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,280
who has

841
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,920
and good image.

842
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,960
With good images.

843
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,239
It's really not easy for Xiao Jin

844
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,320
to get to where she is today.

845
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,519
But one day,

846
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,360
one day.

847
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,360
That's why we should be more careful.

848
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,599
And protect everything.

849
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,719
I know she's under great pressure.

850
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,719
I also know that our company

851
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,719
to make money, Xiaojin has to

852
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,559
work overload

853
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,920
but this will

854
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:24,960
the more we need

855
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,199
to work with Mr. Mu all the more.

856
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,159
Only when I make money

857
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,119
to terminate the contract?

858
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,119
Right?

859
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,039
Alright.

860
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,960
Got it.

861
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,320
Go back first.

862
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,320
Let's think about the cooperation

863
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,480
the cooperation tomorrow.

864
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,159
Have a good rest.

865
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,039
Thank you for your hard work today.

866
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,800
Jin,

867
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,559
the dream that you went through

868
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,840
tried so hard to realize

869
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,239
are you really going to give up all of a sudden?

870
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,599
They all say that twins have tacit understanding.

871
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,719
What are you thinking?

872
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,079
Sister, please wake up.

873
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,679
Shooting star.

874
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,559
We finally saw a shooting star.

875
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,079
I will be a geologist

876
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,320
when I grow up.

877
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,400
Who can catch a shooting star every day.

878
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,840
I'll appear on TV

879
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,039
that way, sis.

880
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,800
♪ No matter where we catch a meteor, ♪

881
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,280
You can see me

882
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,719
and you see me.

883
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,639
Then I can

884
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
to cheer you up.

885
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,119
Little Jin has been working hard.

886
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,599
All these are her testimonies.

887
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,119
Miss Su,

888
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,679
I know it would be selfish

889
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,719
to replace her with you.

890
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,719
If that's too hard for you,

891
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,800
I won't force you.

892
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,360
I won't let you lose

893
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,719
lose it easily.

894
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,559
Hey.

895
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,239
Miss Su.

896
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,199
Hello, Fang Jie?

897
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:20,719
I won't terminate the contract.

898
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,280
Also,

899
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,239
I have a surprise for you.

900
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,360
Boss.

901
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,920
You've been in the car

902
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,880
for five meetings.

903
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:38,920
Are you sure you won't go up

904
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,480
the whole day?

905
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,199
There were so many people at the scene yesterday.

906
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,239
I've seen everything that should be seen.

907
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,360
I don't want to lose face.

908
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,159
Look at that.

909
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,920
There are many people inside.

910
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,239
He should be OK now.

911
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,800
Boss.

912
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:58,840
If now

913
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,079
su Jin comes to apologize to you,

914
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,360
will you forgive her?

915
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,800
Apology is essential.

916
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,239
And I won't forgive you.

917
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Unless she kneels down and begs me

918
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
to forgive my mistake yesterday.

919
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,280
I wanted to give you a surprise.

920
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,199
Marry me

921
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,800
mr. Mu.

922
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,119
It's cold now.

923
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,320
Just cooperate.

924
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,360
They haven't punished you

925
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,400
for yesterday's matter.

926
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,159
Don't be mad.

927
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,519
They're watching.

928
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,599
Promise her.

929
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,440
Promise her.

930
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,480
Promise her.

931
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:56,960
Promise her.

932
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,519
Promise her.

933
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,440
Promise her.

934
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,360
Promise her.

935
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,239
Promise her.

936
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,079
Qin.

937
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,559
You've fought hard for.

938
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,480
I will defend your life.

939
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,440
Mr. Mu,

940
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,000
I remember I asked you to come here today

941
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,239
to refuse the proposal yesterday.

942
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,719
And state the reason.

943
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,159
It's not a proposal

944
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,039
with the proposal today?

945
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,039
I told you yesterday.

946
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,079
I hate the most

947
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:22,960
Is when others violate

948
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,119
my plans.

949
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,280
You changed your hairstyle,

950
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,679
you didn't inform me.

951
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,440
Only a skilled waltz

952
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,400
but modern dance instead of waltz?

953
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,159
That's a hot dance.

954
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,039
Also,

955
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,360
you're not only black,

956
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,480
and fat.

957
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,760
Your hands...

958
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,440
Your hairstyle?

959
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,440
You need it for the cover shoot.

960
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,639
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

961
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,800
Have a hot dance.

962
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,719
Because the atmosphere there

963
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,719
because the atmosphere wasn't warm enough.

964
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,599
As an artist,

965
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,199
the instinct for professionalism.

966
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,199
To create the atmosphere.

967
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,320
On my hands.

968
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,280
Fat and dark.

969
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,960
Sorry

970
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,920
no one stipulates that artists should

971
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:54,559
that an entertainer can only...

972
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,400
She can only stay at home.

973
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,639
They can't do outdoor sports.

974
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,920
Usually, I like to

975
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
Is that a problem?

976
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,119
And also

977
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,199
I think with

978
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,159
of my body and skin tone

979
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:05,760
very pretty.

980
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:07,480
However

981
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,119
these changes

982
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,239
have seriously affected

983
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,039
my life.

984
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,719
So,

985
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,119
I hope you can give me

986
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,400
a reasonable explanation.

987
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,000
It proves that

988
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,039
you will be a very

989
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,239
very qualified partner.

990
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Otherwise,

991
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:21,960
we can talk about

992
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,039
the termination of the cooperation

993
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,559
and compensation for the damage.

994
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,039
I was so happy with him,

995
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,199
I forgot the first party.

996
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
I can explain.

997
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,760
My personality changed because

998
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,880
It's because...

999
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,880
It's because...

1000
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,440
I don't want to

1001
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,960
like a pure white girl anymore.

1002
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,239
That's right.

1003
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,199
That's right.

1004
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:46,920
Actually,

1005
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,320
you know the situation I'm in.

1006
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,559
I've been in the industry for three years.

1007
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,519
No matter for me

1008
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,440
and my team,

1009
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,440
we all hope that Su Jin

1010
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,159
she has some

1011
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,000
change in her personality.

1012
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
So whether you reject the proposal

1013
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,159
reject the proposal or counter the proposal,

1014
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,800
are the events that I can set off

1015
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,400
and smooth transition.

1016
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,679
That's it.

1017
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,320
Turn.

1018
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:12,920
Transformation?

1019
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:13,639
Well

1020
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,159
why didn't you tell me in advance

1021
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,199
tell me in advance?

1022
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,480
Because I thought

1023
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,119
for the best effect.

1024
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,760
And it's proven that

1025
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,960
I did the right thing.

1026
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,039
Not only did I break through

1027
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,039
my character setting,

1028
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,199
and this time

1029
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,199
the spreading effect

1030
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
brought by the proposal

1031
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,039
that's the reason

1032
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,119
to rise...

1033
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:31,719
Against the trend and went up.

1034
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
Broke through the highest level this year.

1035
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,239
And is expected to rise further.

1036
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,119
How is it, Mr. Mu?

1037
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,599
Are you not satisfied

1038
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
with our result?

1039
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,199
Did you see the window?

1040
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,719
Everything

1041
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,559
have their own

1042
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,239
their own rules.

1043
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,039
Once

1044
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,559
this rule is broken,

1045
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,719
then a disaster

1046
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,679
a disaster will happen.

1047
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,320
The president is always so exaggerating?

1048
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,039
There is still one month left.

1049
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,280
I hope that during this period,

1050
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,679
to affect

1051
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
anything I've prepared.

1052
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,440
You can leave if you understand what I mean.

1053
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,360
So you mean that

1054
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
we won't terminate the contract ahead of time?

1055
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,079
That's it.

1056
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,599
Alright.

1057
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,480
Mr. Mu, I'll leave you to your work.

1058
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,719
Transformation?

1059
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,559
Is that an excuse to brush me off?

1060
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,239
If you don't follow the script,

1061
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,280
mr. Mu let it go.

1062
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,400
I heard that

1063
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,239
his terrifying level

1064
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,280
that kind of thing.

1065
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,039
There are not only 100 stars,

1066
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,000
all the stars in the sky

1067
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,199
all over the world. I'm afraid of him.

1068
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,519
By the way, Fang Jie,

1069
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,800
tell me about

1070
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,400
of Qin Qing and Mu Hurun.

1071
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Send me an electronic copy.

1072
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,480
Don't be diligent.

1073
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,960
I understand the artist's contract.

1074
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,119
Why do you want a cooperation agreement

1075
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:36,960
a cooperation agreement between Mr. Mu and Jin?

1076
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,000
There's only one month left.

1077
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,679
Is that it's the reason

1078
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,440
Is there one month left.

1079
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,320
I've sent it to you, Miss Su.

1080
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,199
Party A will provide resource support.

1081
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,960
Party B will need to

1082
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,880
party B needs to date with Party A.

1083
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,199
The date is not limited to holding hands.

1084
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,840
Hug and physical interaction.

1085
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,280
Stay over at home.
