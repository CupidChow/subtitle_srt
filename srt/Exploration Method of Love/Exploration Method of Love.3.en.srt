1
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,840
Do you mean that Mu's Group...

2
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,760
Aside from his own

3
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
his own established businesses,

4
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,079
he has also invested in

5
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,280
many other industries,

6
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,879
like the entertainment industry,

7
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,079
the internet industry,

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
because of Su Jin,

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,640
brought more people

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,959
know about Mu's Group.

11
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,719
Is more convenient for him.

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,319
To break into the young market.

13
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,840
The more outstanding your sister is,

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,879
the greater the benefits

15
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,199
to Mu's Group.

16
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,800
So for coal bosses

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,879
to him,

18
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,919
presenting data is the most direct way.

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,639
Bad luck.

20
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,120
This is not good!

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,879
Brother Fang,

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,400
the paparazzi

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,639
was snapped by the paparazzi yesterday.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,080
I know.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,919
Do you know this?

26
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,319
Sis,

27
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,599
special effect: It was changed to a photo of Su Jishi with the lead.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
This one has a bad expression.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
This one is not at a good angle.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
The rest are beautiful.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,719
They have nothing to say.

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,960
I don't think it's the point.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,039
These are not important.

34
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,479
Just a few photos.

35
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,400
What's more,

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,960
this is

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,080
muscle.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,159
It's not fat meat.

39
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,360
Alright.

40
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,000
Wait here.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
I'll hit their faces right away.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
What do you want?

43
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,800
It means we haven't gained weight.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,439
This is what you call

45
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,800
we have no money at all.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,680
The more I prove, the more people will talk about it.

47
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,560
What can we do

48
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,159
we have to respond.

49
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,439
Fang Xie,

50
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,479
If we can

51
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,360
we can turn around the public opinion

52
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,759
and increase

53
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,800
su Jin's profile and popularity

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,639
but also

55
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,800
mu Hurun's image and popularity.

56
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,960
Maybe

57
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,599
It might be worth something.

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,879
And ask Mu Xiuren to renew his contract with us.

59
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,039
That would be great.

60
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,520
But what do you plan to do?

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,039
I'm here to show you.

62
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:22,960
Shoot.

63
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,520
Three.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,280
Two.

65
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:24,879
One.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,759
Get the right angle.

67
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,960
I want it further away.

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
You need to get pictures of my whole body.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Okay, no problem.

70
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,840
Here. Take a closer picture of this.

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,199
Just focus on me.

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,719
Three.

73
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,400
Two.

74
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,000
One

75
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,719
can you really do this?

76
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,120
Sis,

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
let me adjust the light and shadow.

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
It's not that fake.

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
With a filter.

80
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,280
Alright.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,719
Sister.

82
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,439
That's awesome.

83
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,520
You still know this?

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,319
Nothing.

85
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,759
I used to

86
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
I always took photos for my roommates.

87
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,400
Next,

88
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,560
and wait for the netizens' replies.

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
My daughter

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,879
has fallen in love with outdoor sports recently.

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,439
Well

92
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,639
your skin is a little sunburned.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Purple

94
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,879
goes well with her current style.

95
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,159
Alright.

96
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,840
Alright.

97
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,639
I'll wait for your schedule then.

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,759
Alright.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,199
That sounds like good news.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
Since you posted those photos,

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,079
this is the third company

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,839
to come here voluntarily.

103
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,439
Your own brand.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,199
I used to be

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,959
you don't have

106
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,800
like this.

107
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,399
That means my public relations is successful.

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,920
What are the comments?

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,399
There are supportive comments

110
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,240
saying that your aesthetics are deformed now.

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
Beauty is being thin,

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
they don't pay much attention to health.

113
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,160
But there's a saying

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
that you have no work ethic.

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,680
As an actor,

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
why do I have to look for an angle

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,639
but you have to find an angle to sculpt.

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Is our trick really reliable?

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,480
Don't worry.

120
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,519
I haven't finished with my plan yet.

121
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,959
Only the rest will come.

122
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you mean that

123
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,800
In the future?

124
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,639
Xia, give me the phone.

125
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,680
That Weibo just now

126
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,399
It's all about

127
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,240
my photography skills.

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
I wasn't praising you.

129
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm criticizing.

130
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,319
Who says

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
that high heels are the standard for women?

132
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,600
Or convex.

133
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,879
Be superior to others?

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,240
I hope you can find

135
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,519
you can find your balance.

136
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,199
Certainly.

137
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,800
For the role,

138
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll also work hard to reduce fat and healthy.

139
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Don't send this one.

140
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,600
Our relationship will be exposed once we send it.

141
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,800
What about the endorsement we just got?

142
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,199
Trust me.

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,959
People now

144
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,160
they like to be frank

145
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
I like to be frank.

146
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,959
In the world.

147
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,519
If we work in the opposite direction,

148
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,120
will gain more favorable comments than faking it.

149
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,079
Fang Xie,

150
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,120
that's all?

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Just accept it.

152
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,439
Miss Su,

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,040
those writers of entertainment reporters

154
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,519
are very sharp.

155
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,839
Even a little mistake

156
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,680
will be infinitely magnified.

157
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
They're waiting in line

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,519
to pick a quarrel with you.

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,279
Do you know that

160
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
that every living thing on Earth

161
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,879
rely on the sun to survive.

162
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,959
And the sun

163
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,639
does not exist for that.

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,959
Little Su is so handsome these days.

165
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,800
It's over.

166
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
She is hopeless.

167
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Hopeless.

168
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,480
Boss.

169
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,560
A new proposal.

170
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,439
Find some small and medium-sized companies

171
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,519
that are suitable for our project.

172
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,560
And some overseas

173
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,480
overseas nickel mine research.

174
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,639
Keep this plan

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,000
keep it a secret from Second Uncle's team.

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Tomorrow at the meeting,

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,720
tomorrow at the meeting.

178
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,000
Got it.

179
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,879
Su Jin is in the top search again.

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,079
What does this woman want again?

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,399
This is boring.

182
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,399
Hey.

183
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,519
He's so inhuman.

184
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,399
I can't do this.

185
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,720
It works.

186
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,160
It's waterproof.

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Take it back.

188
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,839
If you want me to pick it up,

189
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,560
I need to take a vacation.

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,639
Whoever listens to the other first

191
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,279
I got it first.

192
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,040
You work all year round.

193
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,600
She's really tough.

194
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
We can buy another phone.

195
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,759
Have you found it?

196
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll bring you a towel.

197
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,399
You're so cool.

198
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,319
Why does she come?

199
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,399
You followed me here?

200
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,399
Haven't I made myself clear

201
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,559
not clear enough?

202
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,120
Reformed: Nickel mine. I'm good at that.

203
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Why are you here?

204
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,799
Gao Ling showed you

205
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,799
my Weibo.

206
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,039
About that

207
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,639
weibo saying that she looks anxious.

208
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,519
The discussion about it

209
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,559
Is very high.

210
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,039
I praised...

211
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,080
You have good taste.

212
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
They said that Jinxiu and her husband were the light of men and women.

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
Even your company's Weibo

214
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
a lot of fans.

215
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,720
So?

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,039
As long as my

217
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,320
remain popular,

218
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,159
we can promote our company.

219
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's

220
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,279
and sprinkle sugar irregularly.

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,519
The two of us

222
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,639
It's good for both of us.

223
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,679
I can use other methods.

224
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,919
There's no need to use this.

225
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,919
Like what?

226
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,080
Let me be honest with you.

227
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,919
It's too risky to cooperate with you.

228
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,279
No matter how risky it is with the high reward,

229
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,399
I won't let the risks

230
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:19,799
In the hands

231
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,200
except me.

232
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,440
You want to enter the nickel intermediate market?

233
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,600
State F

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,799
the laterite of State F

235
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,919
the quality of nickel ore

236
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,279
Is much higher than that of E State.

237
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,679
How did you know?

238
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,320
Just a little.

239
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,159
I really don't understand

240
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,480
an ordinary

241
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
that you know

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,279
know too much?

243
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,679
Be professional, okay?

244
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,559
I specially studied geology

245
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,559
specially for you.

246
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,600
That's a valuable suggestion.

247
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,240
Worth your cooperation, right?

248
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
And I'll agree to cooperate with you.

249
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,440
That's going too far

250
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
he provoked me.

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,759
Don't you agree

252
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,519
If I jump off?

253
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,679
Do you have a bottom line?

254
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,600
My bottom line?

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
Is to ask you to consider

256
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,600
my suggestion.

257
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm telling you for the last time.

258
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,240
No matter how good your quality is,

259
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,320
If I can't control

260
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,679
can't control,

261
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,639
It's still trash to me.

262
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,879
I'm also telling you this once.

263
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
I'll show you

264
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,519
turning waste into wealth.

265
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,440
Our cooperation with Tiansheng

266
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,279
with Tiansheng.

267
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,759
I asked someone to get to know the situation.

268
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,799
It was your second uncle playing tricks behind.

269
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
I'll handle this.

270
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,960
Go on.

271
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Considering Miss Su's ability to deliver goods,

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,159
the public relations department suggested that

273
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,279
to choose Miss Su to be

274
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,360
of the fried chicken brand.

275
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,559
Consider it.

276
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,519
But I would like to see

277
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,519
to look at the cooperation plan.

278
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,639
Considering Miss Su's commercial value,

279
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,360
If you can continue

280
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,279
work with her,

281
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
we can gain something

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,639
to both parties.

283
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,279
I've decided to

284
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,600
end the cooperation with her.

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,039
There's no need to waste more time.

286
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:22,759
However...

287
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
My goodness!

288
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,879
Su Jin is in our company.

289
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,440
Why did you come?

290
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,600
If this goes on,

291
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
I will terminate the cooperation immediately.

292
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Mr. Mu, time is precious.

293
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
I'll come straight to the point.

294
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,879
You want to do nickel intermediate products?

295
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
I can help you complete the plan.

296
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
Mr. Mu, consider this.

297
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,320
The contract renewal.

298
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,320
Miss Su?

299
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm really curious.

300
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,159
Why you suddenly

301
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,360
so abnormal?

302
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,480
Is this yours?

303
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,360
Why does he have the hammer?

304
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,440
Mr. Mu,

305
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Is it convenient for you now?

306
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,679
Understood.

307
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,279
You want to do it?

308
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,600
The upstream product for high-nickel batteries.

309
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,679
But now it's

310
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,879
Is trapped in the cathode material.

311
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,240
Of positive electrode materials.

312
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,480
I know where it is.

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,519
Where I can help you find the information

314
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,200
and solve the problem.

315
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,879
Heroine OS: I miss the school library. I'm more comfortable there.

316
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,080
I came to the library to look for data

317
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
want to try something new?

318
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,000
To attract my attention?

319
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,600
Why are you staring at me?

320
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,480
Find the book.

321
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
Aren't you afraid of being recognized

322
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,279
aren't you afraid of being recognized?

323
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,519
And affect the order of the Library.

324
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,440
People here only care about academics

325
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
not the entertainment industry.

326
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,600
How can someone working in the entertainment industry

327
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,919
so interested in academic affairs

328
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,919
In academic affairs?

329
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,799
It's for your sake

330
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,039
to get your approval.

331
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,120
Don't worry, Mr. Mu.

332
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
I will protect you.

333
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,879
Why are you taking my coffee?

334
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,720
What?

335
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,559
Your assistant isn't with you.

336
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,000
You can't take care of yourself anymore?

337
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,440
Forget about it.

338
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,519
In order to renew our contract,

339
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,240
I endure this.

340
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,679
Yes

341
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,519
It's my fault.

342
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,879
I shouldn't have put my coffee

343
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,080
with your coffee.

344
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,799
I'll go and

345
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,000
and buy you a new one.

346
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,639
No need.

347
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,080
It's good that you know you're wrong.

348
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,360
Look at that.

349
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,559
Isn't she that?

350
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,279
The super star Su Jin.

351
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,240
To know me?

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Go to your study.

353
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,080
Is that you they want?

354
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
Narcissistic.

355
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,600
Be accomplished

356
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,320
since I've been a huge help,

357
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,120
Is it Mr. Mu that

358
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,679
consider

359
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,679
renewing your contract with me.

360
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,039
Thank you, Miss Su,

361
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,799
for your help.

362
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:27,960
Apart from renewing the contract,

363
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,879
what did you want

364
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,639
whatever you want.

365
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,840
What's up

366
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,600
the power is out.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,639
Are you scared of the dark?

368
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,919
Aren't you scared?

369
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,960
Aren't you afraid that you are hugging so tightly?

370
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
Where is the exit?

371
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,200
Be careful.

372
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
It's this way.

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,519
Don't take the wrong place.

374
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,360
Where's your phone?

375
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,360
It's...

376
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,000
It's in the bag.

377
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,720
(Where are you?)

378
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,519
Where are you?

379
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm here.

380
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,759
You

381
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,599
really.

382
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,000
This way.

383
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
I told you it's over there.

384
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't step on my foot, okay?

385
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,319
Get out of my way!

386
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,799
Put me down.

387
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,880
I can walk on my own.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,519
After you walk out, it'll be morning.

389
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,839
Am I right?

390
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,039
Su Jin, you're welcome.

391
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,079
You blushed.

392
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,880
You're the one to blame.

393
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,480
It's not that you want to say that

394
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,519
helped you so much.

395
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,119
Why not renew your contract with me?

396
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Why did you insist

397
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,839
to renew the contract?

398
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,720
For money?

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,920
Considering your current position,

400
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
you don't need it.

401
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,319
To strengthen myself.

402
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Protecting a country

403
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,160
very important to me

404
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
very important to me.

405
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,000
Everyone has something

406
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
something to protect.

407
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,279
But at the same time,

408
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,240
you'll have to pay the price.

409
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,759
I can understand you.

410
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,759
But I won't renew your contract because of this.

411
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,559
Just forget about it.

412
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,920
Mu Huron.

413
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,599
The word "forget it"

414
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,480
In my life.

415
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,519
Want me to give up my contract renewal?

416
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,559
Mu Huron.

417
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,920
I advise you to give up that idea as soon as possible.

418
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,359
Miss Su,

419
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,599
what do you think of today's makeup

420
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,880
what?

421
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:58,680
What about

422
00:18:59,599 --> 00:18:59,920
perfect.

423
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,400
Something has happened.

424
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,559
What happened?

425
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,480
Su Jin comes home with a black face.

426
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,039
I haven't been in the same room with Mu Xiuren for a long time.

427
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,319
They suspected that they had a love affair.

428
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,119
Well

429
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,960
got it.

430
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,759
Aren't you renewing your contract?

431
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
You spilled dirty water in front of our door.

432
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,359
Why aren't you in a hurry?

433
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,920
What's there to be anxious about?

434
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
I arranged this.

435
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,119
What do you mean?

436
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,400
You'll find out later.

437
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,880
Set out.

438
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,200
Where are we going?

439
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,839
I'm going to the battlefield.

440
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,519
Don't ask me to come to you

441
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,759
In the future.

442
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:48,839
It's boring.

443
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,640
Mr. Mu, nice to meet you.

444
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,359
Then please

445
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,720
find me a new partner

446
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,839
a new partner right away.

447
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,640
How to deal with mom first?

448
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
She can find a blind date

449
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,079
she can find

450
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,759
to find partners.

451
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,839
Mr. Mu.

452
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Ms. Gao.

453
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,720
Mrs. Gao.

454
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:07,680
Hello

455
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
I've long wanted to go to Tiansheng

456
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,720
to visit you two

457
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,920
I didn't expect to see you here.

458
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
I've heard that Mr. Mu's girlfriend

459
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,839
Is a super star.

460
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,240
Why didn't you come along this time?

461
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,039
Xiaoman.

462
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,440
Second Uncle.

463
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,079
Second Uncle!

464
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,000
You're the naughty one.

465
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,279
Didn't you say that

466
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,720
like such an occasion?

467
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,640
Even Second Uncle couldn't invite them.

468
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,839
Came with your brother.

469
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,079
Second Uncle.

470
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,039
I'm having a good time

471
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,559
to hang out with my brother.

472
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,559
I'll meet my friend first.

473
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,279
You two have a chat.

474
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,039
Go on

475
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,000
huron.

476
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,599
Where is Little Su?

477
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,000
They broke up?

478
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,680
Mr. Mu and Miss Su

479
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm often in the news recently.

480
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,319
It's so enviable.

481
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,000
You both don't know something.

482
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
My Huron

483
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
Is a regular attendee of the entertainment news.

484
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:51,880
Shouldn't he

485
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:53,519
having a fight...

486
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,160
Break up?

487
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,279
Will be on the trending topic?

488
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,720
The love life of young people

489
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,039
as her elders,

490
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
shouldn't interfere too much.

491
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,000
Second Uncle is just showing his concern.

492
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,519
Your relationship

493
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,119
that you two are close friends.

494
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,240
We should learn from you

495
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,599
should learn more from you.

496
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,079
My Huron

497
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,559
It's kind of a long-term relationship.

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,079
Let me make a guess.

499
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
Your next girlfriend

500
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,039
will be a actress.

501
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,119
Second Uncle is making fun of me again.

502
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,279
Enough.

503
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,240
Alright.

504
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,319
No kidding.

505
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,720
Now, seriously.

506
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,279
Is it true on the news?

507
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,359
That's it.

508
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,039
Second Uncle.

509
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,799
Do you really believe the gossip?

510
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,359
It's just that

511
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,160
for another announcement.

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,119
So he can't make it at the moment.

513
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,160
Furthermore,

514
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,599
she isn't interested in

515
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,000
she is not interested.

516
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
To be honest,

517
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,240
It doesn't matter if we broke up.

518
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,200
I told you

519
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
not to have a celebrity as your girlfriend.

520
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't you believe it?

521
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,759
It's hard not to create

522
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,079
and doing nothing serious.

523
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,559
How can we let these employees

524
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,440
entrust the company to you?

525
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,400
To be a human beforehand.

526
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,640
When you feel at ease,

527
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,519
that's when others are willing to cooperate with you.

528
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
What do you think, Mr. Gao?

529
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,799
You can't put it like this.

530
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
We've acted in an old way.

531
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,880
They're young.

532
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,480
To have their ideas.

533
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,640
Mr. Gao and Mr. Mu.

534
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,640
Do you want to call Miss Su over?

535
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Mu Huron

536
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,720
didn't you want to show off your affection?

537
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,039
At the critical moment of our project cooperation,

538
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,319
the news broke, which led to a breakup.

539
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
You must be under a lot of pressure.

540
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,480
It's fine.

541
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,279
I'll clean up your mess.

542
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,440
The prey I've spotted

543
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,559
that I see.

544
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,240
Little Jin.

546
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
What brings you here?

547
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,279
Mr. Mu.

548
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,400
You looked so nervous.

549
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,480
I just came to

550
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,759
to talk to Mr. Mu.

551
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
And it won't cause any trouble.

552
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,240
I remember I have made myself clear.

553
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,039
I won't renew our appointment.

554
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,359
Take it easy.

555
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,799
Finally a demon comes

556
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,799
to punish him.

557
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,599
Su Jin knows strategy well.

558
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,200
Try fair means before resorting to force

559
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,640
you can't negotiate the business value,

560
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
then you tried to force your brother to surrender.

561
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,400
Mr. Mu,

562
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,720
I forgot to tell you.

563
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,400
My memory is really poor.

564
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,640
One with nothing has no fear.

565
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,079
About...

566
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,079
I'll renew it.

567
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,720
Mr. Mu, cheer up.

568
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,319
Otherwise, people will misunderstand.

569
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,519
We are not in love.

570
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,519
It won't end well.

571
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,599
What?

572
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,119
Want to show your affection

573
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,440
to force me

574
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,920
to force me to renew my contract.

575
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,599
I know that Mr. Mu came here

576
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,160
to establish closer relations

577
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,880
with Tiansheng's Mr. Gao.

578
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm here to help.

579
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,640
Of course, if you don't want to

580
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,319
I can leave now.

581
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,960
If you leave,

582
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,799
you should bear the consequences.

583
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,480
You should know that.

584
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,839
Miss Su, that's a good move.

585
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,240
Mr. Mu has to maintain

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
a good man.

587
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,480
It's impossible. Next month,

588
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,440
next month.

589
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,559
Otherwise, the media

590
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,519
the media is one-sided,

591
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,680
he dallied with me and abandoned me.

592
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,839
She's really great.

593
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,359
No wonder they're superstars.

594
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,599
She attracts people wherever she goes.

595
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,880
My behavior just now

596
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,279
was indeed untimely.

597
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,160
I wish to take this opportunity

598
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,480
I apologize to all of you.

599
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,519
Mainly

600
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,279
I argued with Huron yesterday

601
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,920
but we stipulated that

602
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
we can't quarrel overnight.

603
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,200
So...

604
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,279
I was too impulsive just now.

605
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,920
He is still young.

606
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,720
It's understandable.

607
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,519
Certainly.

608
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:12,920
Allow me to introduce.

609
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,319
They are

610
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,839
gao and Mrs. Gao from Tiansheng

611
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,960
this is my fiancée, Su Jin.

612
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,799
Is he Tiansheng of new energy?

613
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,440
You've done your homework well.

614
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Nice to meet you.

615
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,240
Nice to meet you.

616
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,839
Miss Su,

617
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
she even knows about our company.

618
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,240
That's because Huron

619
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,480
he talks to me about

620
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,680
about

621
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,079
high-nickel battery.

622
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,400
Since high-nickel battery

623
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,920
high-nickel battery is that good?

624
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,440
I told you to just make it.

625
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,519
All-nickel batteries?

626
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,240
Little Su.

627
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,119
You're good at show business.

628
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,279
In business,

629
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,599
In business.

630
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,359
Miss Su is right.

631
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,519
The all-nickel battery

632
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,440
Is indeed

633
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
Is the direction

634
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
our future.

635
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,960
I didn't expect that

636
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,480
miss Su is pretty

637
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,519
and interesting.

638
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,480
I have to

639
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,000
I need to learn more from you.

640
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:55,680
Right?

641
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,119
Huron.

642
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,000
Of course I will.

643
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,160
Mr. Mu and I had a research project

644
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
with Mr. Xiao Mu.

645
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,119
I was hesitant

646
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,359
but today,

647
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,599
saw Miss Su

648
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,039
my beloved wife,

649
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:07,640
then she can

650
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,079
be a relief to him.

651
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,720
Mr. Gao is really flattered.

652
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,680
I didn't rush it today.

653
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
I'll visit you

654
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,640
one by one.

655
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,400
Remember to

656
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,799
to bring Miss Su along.

657
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,920
I want to talk to her more.

658
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,599
I will.

659
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,079
Huron and I will go there.

660
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,720
Great.

661
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,079
Welcome

662
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,200
where are you going?

663
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,119
Hey.

664
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,920
I'm at the door.

665
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,319
Alright.

666
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:40,839
Waiting for you.

667
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,200
We're leaving.

668
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,799
Su Jin is coming.

669
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,559
My mission has been completed.

670
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,279
Prepare to retreat.

671
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:49,559
Oh, right.

672
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Please check it out.

673
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,960
This type of boy

674
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,759
(Kind of gift) would like

675
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,960
what kind of gift?

676
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,759
Your boyfriend?

677
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,160
Kind of.

678
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,599
Your brother is here tonight.

679
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,039
Why don't you let them meet?

680
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,519
Please don't.

681
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,119
My brother's unpleasant face

682
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,319
or scaring people away.

683
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,279
Brother Gao Ling,

684
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,160
please.

685
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,640
Keep it a secret for me, okay?

686
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:13,640
Alright.

687
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,400
But I can only temporarily

688
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,079
to keep it a secret.

689
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,240
OK.

690
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:21,799
Alright.

691
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,559
I'll leave now.

692
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,599
Before continuing,

693
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,079
I want to make this collaboration clear.

694
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,759
You violated the cooperation several times.

695
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,359
One

696
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,599
not cooperating with the proposal.

697
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,200
Second,

698
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,400
without the permission

699
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,240
party B proposes to him

700
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,880
party B proposes in public without permission.

701
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,039
Here he comes again.

702
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,920
Without any appointment

703
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,039
without any reservation,

704
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,119
to see Party A without permission.

705
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,599
IV.

706
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,160
I agree with all these.

707
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,200
To cooperate is to

708
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
are maintained cooperatively.

709
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,440
Stipulate the obligations

710
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,559
of both parties.

711
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,640
So now in order to

712
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
to protect our rights,

713
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,000
to protect our rights.

714
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Shouldn't you

715
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,480
your position first?

716
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,039
I don't ask for much.

717
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,279
Firstly,

718
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,720
you have the right

719
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,079
of rejecting two dates every month.

720
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,599
Two.

721
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,400
If we are in crisis,

722
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,799
of public relations.

723
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,480
Three.

724
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,480
I want a share of the profit

725
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,079
I have the right to get a share

726
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,319
from the cooperation.

727
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,119
I think you need to understand one thing.

728
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,359
Renewing your contract with me has done more harm than good.

729
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,960
If you piss me off,

730
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,839
I can afford the disadvantages.

731
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,720
Maybe Miss Su can afford it.

732
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,720
Mr. Mu,

733
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,000
so you want to repent?

734
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,599
Do you know what is

735
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,880
what is your greatest flaw?

736
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,119
That you're replaceable.

737
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,720
Then do you know

738
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,440
what is my greatest strength?

739
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,880
We have

740
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,920
cooperation experience.

741
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
And I'm very cooperative.

742
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,279
In order to show my sincerity,

743
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm willing to make a compromise.

744
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,759
Mr. Mu, what do you think?

745
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,359
It's interesting.

746
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
I like to work with smart people.

747
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,279
I'll ask the legal division

748
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,200
refine the terms and conditions

749
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,279
and send it to you after I seal it.

750
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:35,720
Hold on.

751
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,720
I have another condition.

752
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,720
Miss Su,

753
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,839
you're so cool.

754
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,799
Mr. Mu is such a horrible and difficult person.

755
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,759
To win him over?

756
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,960
However,

757
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,000
what are the conditions?

758
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,960
Mr. Mu also instructed

759
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
to strictly execute the rules.

760
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,359
I can't have feelings for him.

761
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,079
♪ Once you like him and take action ♪

762
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,799
It includes but is not limited to love, pursue

763
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,759
being jealous of the same sex.

764
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,480
That's breaking our agreement.

765
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
And you should take responsibility for the consequences.

766
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,559
That Mu Huron...

767
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,720
Is he having a cramp?

768
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,559
To prevent me from falling in love with him.

769
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,279
I...

770
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,079
Can I fall in love with

771
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,839
he's such a narcissist.

772
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,440
Just kidding.

773
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,519
That's right.

774
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,519
Miss Su has

775
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,319
want to make a career.

776
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,640
What's the problem with that?

777
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm an independent woman.

778
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,480
An independent woman,

779
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,279
we have a job to do.

780
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,599
That we need to work on.

781
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,720
This story

782
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,039
Is set in a university campus,

783
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,079
the heroine

784
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,160
which is you.

785
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,759
You are a very

786
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,839
and transparent person.

787
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,160
They were discriminated against in the school.

788
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,119
She was even bullied by the big sis at school.

789
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,720
Even the boy she likes

790
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,240
doesn't give her a look.

791
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,160
The typical one

792
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,759
loser persona.

793
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,799
But one day,

794
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,839
you accidentally got

795
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,920
a Mysterious Note.

796
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,079
You found that

797
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,400
as long as I write down

798
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,680
on the notes,

799
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
will both die

800
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,079
fall in love with you crazily.

801
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,359
So it is.

802
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,640
Notes on Love.

803
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,920
The script is so boring.

804
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,279
Is it your time to

805
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,359
to judge whether the script's good or not.

806
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,200
It's me.

807
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,000
What I meant was,

808
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,319
after hearing that,

809
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:12,799
miss Su.

810
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,359
Do you get a feel for it?

811
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,599
Nothing.

812
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:16,880
This character

813
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,039
Isn't mine at all.

814
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,079
I can't act.

815
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,920
Miss Su,

816
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,160
you are a perfect student.

817
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,359
Why don't you have the spirit

818
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,400
to explore and climb?

819
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,039
Giving up without even giving it a try.

820
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,039
Is so weak.

821
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,079
Provoking me.

822
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,759
It won't work on me.

823
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Miss Su.

824
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,839
Actually, acting is so easy.

825
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,720
And look,

826
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
we've finished shooting.

827
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
We're just catching up on a few scenes.

828
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm sure that

829
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,759
miss Su, with your IQ

830
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,319
and your ability,

831
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,839
Is just a piece of cake.

832
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,839
Flattery.

833
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,799
That won't change anything.

834
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,839
They are my Sister Su

835
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
this is your sister's

836
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,480
of your sister.

837
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,759
It's so important

838
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,880
to an actress.

839
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,119
She worked so hard

840
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,519
we met all the time

841
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,400
to meet the director.

842
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,039
It's hard for me to get this opportunity.

843
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,920
In order to play this role,

844
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,720
she didn't eat

845
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,839
and sleeping.

846
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,599
Look at this.

847
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,920
You always study the character

848
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
with the script.

849
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,480
He's really devoted.

850
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,519
The audience who heard it was heartbroken,

851
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,279
and hears you cry.

852
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,160
Miss Su,

853
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,720
do you bear to see

854
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,599
all your hard work

855
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,359
were in vain?

856
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,480
I can't act.

857
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,680
I never thought

858
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,480
to see you again here.

859
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,160
I firmly took every step

860
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,799
was to leave you

861
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,279
more...

862
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,839
I said I can't do it.

863
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,279
But you said I can't.

864
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,559
Don't be anxious.

865
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,000
This is the hardest scene

866
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,920
In our reshoot.

867
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,839
I'll figure it out.

868
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,599
Let's try again.

869
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:56,519
Try it.

870
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,359
Brother Fang.

871
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,839
Why can't Little Su

872
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,880
can't act anymore?

873
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,680
The...

874
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,039
The other day,

875
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,559
didn't Little Su go on vacation?

876
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,880
Her condition

877
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000
for some time.

878
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,039
They will be fine in a while.

879
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,680
Right.

880
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,519
I'm just not feeling well.

881
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:18,880
Alright.

882
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,759
Let's get straight to the point.

883
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,079
I tried the Brecht

884
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,480
the Expressionist performance.

885
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,279
It doesn't work.

886
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,599
It seems

887
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:27,960
we can only go

888
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,920
the way of the experiential school.

889
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,559
Experience school?

890
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,160
Is one of the most important schools

891
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,000
of dramatic art.

892
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
The essence of this system

893
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,559
lies in reflecting human's nature.

894
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,160
Actors are required

895
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,119
he doesn't seem to exist on the stage,

896
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,880
he actually exists on the stage.

897
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,519
They're not acting,

898
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,599
but living.

899
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,680
Actors should never

900
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,799
they are living persons on the stage.

901
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,759
You should follow the logic of life.

902
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,920
To be honest,

903
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,240
to put it simply,

904
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,079
we can't do anything

905
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,039
take the scene you reshoot for example.

906
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,920
The heroine meets

907
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,240
the object of her heart

908
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,799
the one I love.

909
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,039
Confessing her love?

910
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,719
What you need to experience the most

911
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,119
the feeling of seduction.

912
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,000
Where?

913
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,679
You never dated anyone?

914
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,320
I mean before you debuted,

915
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,039
It's none of your business.

916
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,679
It seems that we need to find someone

917
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,960
to pretend to date with you.

918
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,840
The time is limited.

919
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,360
Where can I find

920
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,079
to find this person.

921
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,800
Me too.

922
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,039
You're right.

923
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:37,679
Forget about it.

924
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,199
Where's Shan?

925
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,480
He's worse than me.

926
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:43,599
Got it.

927
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,760
Mr. Mu.

928
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,719
Let's go and ask Mr. Mu for help.

929
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,559
Don't bother.

930
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,280
He's aloof and narcissistic.

931
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,440
He wouldn't help us.

932
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,039
Fang Xie,

933
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:51,719
just find someone

934
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,400
to someone.

935
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,320
No way.

936
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,639
Then the netizens should spread

937
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,280
about her again.

938
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,559
It seems

939
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,000
there's only one path.

940
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,280
Mr. Mu really

941
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,920
to help us.

942
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,760
I told you not to beg him.

943
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,840
Similar activities

944
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,239
wasn't mentioned in the agreement.

945
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:15,840
So we really can't

946
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,599
helpless.

947
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,760
It is an agreement.

948
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,920
How long have we been working together?

949
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,480
Make an exception.

950
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,840
I think Mr. Mu

951
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
made his point.

952
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,599
Miss Su,

953
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,239
look, Su Jin is here.

954
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:25,760
Fang Xie,

955
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,400
no need to beg him.

956
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,559
Is this your new trick

957
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,360
to attract me?

958
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,239
To attract you.

959
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,440
Miss Su.

960
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,360
Don't be impulsive.

961
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,480
Don't be impulsive.

962
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,119
Fang Xie,

963
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:40,920
come on.

964
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,079
They can talk.

965
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,400
Mr. Mu,

966
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,159
this is to attract

967
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,360
to attract

968
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
to attract attention?

969
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,000
What a pity.

970
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,960
I won't buy it.

971
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,599
Fang Xie,

972
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,440
brother, go home!

973
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,440
Mom, something happened.

974
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,480
Brother.

975
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,119
Mom, what exactly happened?

976
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,559
Your mother actually...

977
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,400
Actually, this question...

978
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,480
Is neither a big nor a big

979
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,559
Is the smallest.

980
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,000
Take a look and you'll know.

981
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,400
I thought the operation

982
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,519
a great success.

983
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,519
Let's hit the top of the road. On the way.

984
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,679
Push the tower.

985
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:46,840
My red!

986
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,559
Don't steal my red.

987
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,559
You'd better see it for yourself.

988
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,000
Mom,

989
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,639
his dad.

990
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,320
His dad, I'm so sorry.

991
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,239
Please take me away.

992
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,880
His dad, I'm so sorry.

993
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,719
This brat,

994
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm sorry.

995
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,039
Nurse

996
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,239
I feel dizzy again.

997
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,239
And my blood pressure is up again.

998
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:05,920
Come on.

999
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,159
Doctor!

1000
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:07,599
Please help me!

1001
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,039
Doctor.

1002
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,480
I just wanted a grandchild.

1003
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,599
I suffer from great anxiety.

1004
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,000
Mother!

1005
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,559
Who's that?

1006
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,800
He's tall and handsome.

1007
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,960
But you're really immature.

1008
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,159
Mother.

1009
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,000
Sorry.

1010
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,599
I've been busy with work.

1011
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,960
I should have come back earlier.

1012
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,599
What's wrong?

1013
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
What's wrong?

1014
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,719
The doctor said

1015
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,079
get ready.

1016
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,719
Mom.

1017
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,519
Don't say that.

1018
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,960
It really pissed me off.

1019
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,119
I don't have

1020
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,000
where are my children?

1021
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:42,360
What is it?

1022
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,760
Xia,

1023
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,639
park the car with Shan first.

1024
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,639
Do you remember what I told you

1025
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,960
I told you last night?

1026
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Other than the directors,

1027
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,519
(Mentors) except the directors.

1028
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,400
If you have a question

1029
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,440
that you won't answer,

1030
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,159
♫ Shut up ♫

1031
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,519
Smile. I'm waiting for you.

1032
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,800
You've told me so many times.

1033
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,639
I can even draw

1034
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,639
the director's face.

1035
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,880
You deserve to be a top student.

1036
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,960
I can understand you easily.

1037
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,719
What's the use of just knowing these?

1038
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,719
I should beg Mr. Mu sincerely.

1039
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,679
If he doesn't agree,

1040
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,000
I'll stay in front of his house

1041
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,360
and begged him with all my body.

1042
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,280
Enough.

1043
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,119
Stop worrying.

1044
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,480
Didn't you ask the teacher

1045
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,519
to the teacher before?

1046
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,440
And we also watched

1047
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,159
so many great films.

1048
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,800
Now I'm much better

1049
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
much better than before.

1050
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,760
Don't worry.

1051
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,719
Mu Huron.

1052
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,199
Don't think the world can't turn

1053
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,679
without you.

1054
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:34,840
Huron.

1055
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,599
I know why you're here today.

1056
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,559
A new strategy

1057
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,599
the new strategy of Ohr battery.

1058
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
Your company's Mr. Mu Min Guang

1059
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,719
came to me for this too.

1060
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:45,840
I know that

1061
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,840
he even granted you

1062
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,159
generous benefits.

1063
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:48,880
But you refused.

1064
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,480
I know

1065
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,360
someone in the academic research like you

1066
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,480
doesn't care about money,

1067
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,119
but a breakthrough in technology.

1068
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:56,800
That's why I brought

1069
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,519
bring a very detailed

1070
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,000
a very detailed deployment plan.

1071
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,119
You might change your mind

1072
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,599
after reading it.

1073
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,119
This is a good plan.

1074
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,199
You know me

1075
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,039
that old man.

1076
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,239
Of my old man?

1077
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:18,920
But sorry,

1078
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,159
I really can't accept

1079
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,079
accept your invitation.

1080
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,360
Is there any flaw

1081
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,079
with our plan?

1082
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,639
Is a personal matter.

1083
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,480
Has nothing to do with the proposal.

1084
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,239
If you don't mind me asking,

1085
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,840
Is there anything I can help?

1086
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,519
No one can help.

1087
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,440
It's 12: 00 PM.

1088
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,239
I need to go home.

1089
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,440
Come with me.

1090
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:48,519
Alright.

1091
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,639
Back then,

1092
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
you always came to crash our classes.

1093
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,199
And I can follow her train of thought.

1094
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,159
And you've done well with the assignment.

1095
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,079
I have

1096
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
I checked the name list

1097
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
the whole school,

1098
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
I just didn't see your name.

1099
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,400
Then I realized

1100
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:04,920
not only that

1101
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,079
of this school,

1102
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,320
even the students of this school

1103
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,239
you're not even a student.

1104
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,199
Hello, Head.

1105
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,599
Why are you running?

1106
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,199
Su Jin came to our school to shoot.

1107
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
We just took a look.

1108
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,239
Look at that

1109
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,400
the Su Jin who plays the role of the teacher

1110
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,239
su Jin who played the teacher.

1111
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,880
Head.

1112
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,039
You know him?

1113
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:23,480
Head,

1114
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,320
we're in a hurry.

1115
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Goodbye, Head Zhang.

1116
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,519
Alright.

1117
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,440
Head, we'll leave now.

1118
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,320
Get back to your work.

1119
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,400
I didn't expect that

1120
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,920
my granddaughter An'an

1121
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,960
likes Su Jin to play

1122
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,280
In the Fairy Tales

1123
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,119
the Little Fairy Tales.

1124
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You may not know

1125
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
su Jin is my girlfriend.

1126
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,199
Really?

1127
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,679
One take 116 times.

1128
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,440
Ready.

1129
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,400
Action.

1130
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,000
Card.

1131
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:50,760
No, come again.

1132
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:53,880
Can it work?

1133
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:54,880
I've received over a hundred messages.

1134
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,480
Action.

1135
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,559
One take 117 times.

1136
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:58,599
Come on.

1137
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,840
Card Card!

1138
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,960
No, Xiaojin.

1139
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,719
What's the matter?

1140
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,480
Why are you acting so wrong?

1141
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,119
Look for yourself.

1142
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
How many lines have I got?

1143
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,000
Sorry.

1144
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,599
Sorry, director.

1145
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,199
Mr. Su is not feeling well yesterday.

1146
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,519
So she's not in a good condition today.

1147
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,320
Is there anything like that?

1148
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,280
When will it be finished?

1149
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
You worked on the tracks the whole morning,

1150
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,079
you can't even straighten your back.

1151
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:29,719
When will you finish

1152
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,519
finish this job?

1153
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,880
Thank you all.

1154
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,079
I'm sorry.

1155
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:33,599
Thank you.

1156
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,239
The shooting is not finished yet.

1157
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,559
Yadan is coming.

1158
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,559
Director.

1159
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,039
Our Miss Su

1160
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,280
that's great.

1161
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,639
More than 100.

1162
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,480
I've been acting for years.

1163
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,360
But I've never seen

1164
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
shooting over a hundred times.

1165
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,199
Director,

1166
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:48,920
will you still film me today?

1167
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,920
You know

1168
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
I asked for a leave

1169
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,719
from another group.

1170
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,239
I don't have time

1171
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
to waste time

1172
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
waiting here?

1173
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,199
Serve the meal.

1174
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,119
Let's finish Mr. Xu's acting first.

1175
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,360
Come on.

1176
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,000
Time to eat.

1177
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,480
Time to eat.

1178
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,360
Mentors.

1179
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,119
Today our Miss Su

1180
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,400
please have a drink on site.

1181
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,000
I thought

1182
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,719
being a glamorous and relaxing actor.

1183
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,239
It's not easy now.
