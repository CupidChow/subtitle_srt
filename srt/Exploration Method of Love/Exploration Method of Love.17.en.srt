1
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,959
Your acting is really bad.

2
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,799
You're really

3
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,959
In the past.

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,239
She left all her money.

5
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,079
Why didn't you take it?

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,239
Are you trying to

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,799
are you really going to

8
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,079
live a good life with him?

9
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,640
You know what?

10
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,879
He's not a good man.

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,159
What on earth are you doing here?

12
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
Why did you suddenly return home?

13
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,719
Why would you go back to Bincheng?

14
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,959
What... what can I do?

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to see what you do.

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,799
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,200
If you don't want to study,

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,879
you come here to pretend to be Xiaojin.

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,159
What are you looking at?

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,680
I am your father.

21
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,840
No matter what you two become,

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,919
become what you become,

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,159
not me?

24
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,960
The moment you were on TV,

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
the moment you were on TV.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,039
How is Xiao Jin now?

27
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,599
Where is her?

28
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,879
She's fine.

29
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,479
Mind your own business first.

30
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:30,800
Enough.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
You can see it now.

32
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,599
What do you want now?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,120
This is what I think.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,039
I'll stay here

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
I'll stay here for a few days.

36
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,639
Look at this.

37
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,719
This house belongs to Xiao Jin,

38
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,080
as her father,

39
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,439
I live here.

40
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,039
It's not too much, right?

41
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,800
Recently,

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,560
my own house in Bincheng.

43
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,719
We have nowhere to stay.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Also,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
look at my wound.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
You asked me to look for a house,

47
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,919
or it's not suitable.

48
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,080
Enough. Stop it.

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,759
You can take the second bedroom.

50
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,280
Alright.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
If Xiaojin comes back,

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,879
I'll move out immediately.

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,280
How is your father?

54
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,479
Don't worry. He's fine.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,520
After such an accident,

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
can I

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,680
In the future?

58
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,199
Yours is expensive.

59
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,599
Let's start with you.

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,800
What's up

61
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,120
you won't even

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,319
to drink wine?

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,560
These are the wines

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
the wine I put here

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,280
don't move around.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,240
The wine here

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,159
that's your spirit, right?

68
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,520
What's not to move?

69
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,439
I think it's you who forbid me to drink it.

70
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,639
What are you looking at?

71
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,680
Honey,

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,920
how...

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
How did you know dad would come?

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,920
The things you bought me

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
are of good quality.

76
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,959
But they have a slightly smaller size.

77
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,240
What else is in the bathroom?

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,439
Razors,

79
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,600
shower gel

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,639
are very useful.

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
I know.

82
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,600
That must have cost a lot of money.

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
It's getting late.

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,879
Go back to sleep.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,480
The wine...

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,439
Go to bed.

87
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,879
Go to bed.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
When it comes to my dad,

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,879
I'll tell you when I have time.

90
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,519
What are you doing?

91
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,439
What?

92
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,240
Nothing. Nothing.

93
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,560
It was an accident.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,759
What an accident.

95
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,079
You almost burned down the kitchen.

96
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,959
Or was it an accident?

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,920
What would you like to eat?

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,279
Order something yourself.

99
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,600
I see that

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
you've become thinner recently.

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,800
So I wanted to make you breakfast myself.

102
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,240
I didn't expect it

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,279
Is so unusable.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
I've never done it before. Will it work?

105
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,040
Alright, I can do it myself.

106
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,759
Go out first.

107
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Then I will help you.

108
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,720
No need.

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
What about

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,519
dad, isn't this good?

111
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,839
Just don't smash the bowl.

112
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,879
That won't happen.

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Hurry up and eat.

114
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,079
Look at this bread.

115
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,000
Brown and crispy.

116
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,399
Just the right size.

117
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,120
The egg is also

118
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,240
It's tender.

119
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,000
Alright.

120
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,600
Hour.

121
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
Teach me next time.

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,639
When I learn it,

123
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,399
I can cook for you. What do you think?

124
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,399
It's not a good idea

125
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,399
where is Dad?

126
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,160
I want to talk to you

127
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,040
to talk to you.

128
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,399
What is it?

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,680
I came to you this time

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
because I came to see you

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,399
I have another thing.

132
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
The money

133
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,360
the money I had recently

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
do you think

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
I want to borrow it, not take it.

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,759
Not much at all.

137
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,279
That's it?

138
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,480
Fifty yuan.

139
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,519
Ten thousand.

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Five hundred thousand?

141
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,519
I know you don't have one.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Don't Mu Hurun have one?

143
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,240
I watched the news.

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,839
Isn't he the boss?

145
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Ask him for it.

146
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,959
Why should I give you 500,000?

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,319
To bet it?

148
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,639
I don't have it anymore.

149
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,720
Even if I have it, I won't give you

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,639
I won't give you any.

151
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,160
I suggest you give up now.

152
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,839
Alright, don't be angry.

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,439
I was joking with you.

154
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,920
We are father and daughter.

155
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
There's no need to be so serious.

156
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,040
Right?

157
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,399
Hey, Fang Jie.

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Alright.

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,879
Take me to the scene now.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll wait for you downstairs.

161
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,840
You stay at home

162
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,200
don't run about.

163
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,919
Alright.

164
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,840
That's it.

165
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
Why don't you look well?

166
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,759
Do you need to take a rest?

167
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,000
Nothing.

168
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,000
My dad came yesterday.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,919
We talked late.

170
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,039
Xia,

171
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,799
go tell the director.

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
It seems to me that

173
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,000
you are preoccupied all day.

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Fang Jie, I want to ask you a favor.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,759
What's wrong?

176
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,120
Get someone to keep an eye on my dad.

177
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,200
I don't feel at ease.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Your father?

179
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,519
Can you take a look

180
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,279
to be aware of?

181
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:22,960
Could you please

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,919
please check it again.

183
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,639
Alright.

184
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:32,919
No appointment.

185
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,519
She really can't see Mr. Mu.

186
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
How many times do I have to tell you

187
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,759
for you to understand?

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,879
I am Mu Hurun's future father-in-law.

189
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,360
Do I need an appointment to see him?

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,559
It's the same with father-in-law.

191
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,879
Father-in-law is the same.

192
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,279
This little girl

193
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,480
very hard to adapt yourself.

194
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,559
Give me the phone number.

195
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,440
I will tell him directly.

196
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Security Guard

197
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,759
let go of me.

198
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,240
I have to make a call.

199
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,559
Don't...

200
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,039
Do you know who I am?

201
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,759
I am Mu Huron's father-in-law.

202
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,399
Do you know that?

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,519
What are you doing?

204
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,240
Let go of me.

205
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you doing? -What's the matter with you?

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,440
Come on.

207
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,440
Let go of me.

208
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,240
Mr. Su,

209
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
since we get along so well,

210
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
In the future, if you have any problem,

211
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,559
you must call me.

212
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,120
If Huron

213
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,240
to bully Xiaojin.

214
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,840
I was the first one not to agree.

215
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,120
Will your nephew bully my daughter?

216
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,799
I can't.

217
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I was just saying that

218
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,679
I'm worried that Huron

219
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,919
she's not too serious in love.

220
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
What do you mean?

221
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,759
But some time ago,

222
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,960
there was a rumor

223
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,799
that the two of them

224
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,120
stop it.

225
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,519
Tell me. What's the rumor online?

226
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,399
You don't know?

227
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,240
I don't know.

228
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,159
It's circulating on the Internet.

229
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,919
That Huron and Xiaojin

230
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,960
are fake love and partnership?

231
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,360
That's it.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,080
No wonder Xiao Jin has been

233
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,840
what's wrong with her these days?

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,399
Sorry to keep you waiting, uncle.

235
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,879
You're finally here.

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I haven't finished.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,080
Recently, she always told me that

238
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,799
that some annoying people

239
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,080
on the Internet.

240
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Is there a fake couple?

241
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,519
This way, please.

242
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,759
Second Uncle is indeed very concerned

243
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,000
about Xiao Jin and me.

244
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,600
They are all family.

245
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,759
To show some concern.

246
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,159
Will go there first.

247
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,039
Secretary Wang,

248
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
throw this away.

249
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,480
Throw it away?

250
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't know, Uncle.

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,559
Why you asked me to come?

252
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,039
Actually,

253
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,360
I'm just here to ask

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,919
the rumor about

255
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,639
you are a fake couple,

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,919
are those two false ones?

257
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,399
Of course it is fake, Uncle.

258
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,519
Ji Shi and I

259
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,480
are very close.

260
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,519
It's Ji Shi.

261
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
You know she's not Xiao Jin.

262
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Certainly.

263
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,799
The two sisters' story

264
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,559
you have already

265
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,600
very clearly, right?

266
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Since you know she's not Xiao Jin,

267
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,840
then how come

268
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,679
with her?

269
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Then what's your relationship

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
with Little Jin?

271
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,799
Enough. Enough.

272
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:32,759
Stop it.

273
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,559
I know who you are.

274
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,600
Is not a proper person.

275
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,960
Uncle, I think you

276
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
misunderstood the meaning.

277
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,399
To be honest, Jishi has always

278
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,879
only Ji Shi in my heart.

279
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,320
You can't listen to your words.

280
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,600
Talk to my daughter.

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Can you fool me?

282
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
And make me believe that you can.

283
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,200
Unless,

284
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,200
If they give me one million,

285
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,799
If you give me one million yuan.

286
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,919
Miss Su, why are you here?

287
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,519
You're already upset about paying me.

288
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,399
I didn't mean that.

289
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,799
It's not that

290
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,559
my daughter isn't as rich as you are.

291
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,039
She's highly educated.

292
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,440
She has been sensible and diligent since she was a child.

293
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,159
And supported myself.

294
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,559
And ideas?

295
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,559
And beautiful.

296
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,720
More than enough for you.

297
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,200
Now, I want one million betrothal gifts from you.

298
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
It's too easy for you!

299
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,919
Miss Su,

300
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,840
the bridewealth of one million yuan.

301
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,759
What are you doing here?

302
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,960
How did you know that I'm here?

303
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,279
How would I know?

304
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,679
Will be known by the whole city.

305
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,399
Don't talk first.

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,279
I was just passing by.

307
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
Passing by?

308
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,759
I think you're here to sell your daughter.

309
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,559
With a father like you,

310
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,159
what makes you think

311
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm worth one million?

312
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,399
Honey,

313
00:13:59,399 --> 00:13:59,960
don't call me that.

314
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
You're not my father!

315
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
I want money?

316
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
It's for your own good.

317
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,399
After you marry him,

318
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,360
will you delay

319
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
with your poor father?

320
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,720
Even if he doesn't mind,

321
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,279
will his family mind?

322
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,759
And being rich

323
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,799
I'm different.

324
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,279
It's for your own good.

325
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,279
You said it was for my own good?

326
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,039
You said anything for my sake.

327
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,960
If you really did that for my good,

328
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,799
you shouldn't have bet in the first place.

329
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,639
You shouldn't have separated your family.

330
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,279
You should never

331
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,039
ask Huron for money

332
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,360
you made me so embarrassed.

333
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Leave now.

334
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,159
Ji Shi, calm down.

335
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,840
Talk it over.

336
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,360
Mr. Su, this way please.

337
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
Uncle, calm down.

338
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,240
What's the matter?

339
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Let's go home.

340
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
None of you

341
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,480
refused to pay me.

342
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,879
I will find a way out myself.

343
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,360
What do you mean?

344
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,679
Work hard

345
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,519
sorry.

346
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,360
I shouldn't have let him

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
bother you.

348
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,320
It won't happen again.

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,279
I'll go home now.

350
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,759
What are you talking about?

351
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,399
What do you mean by disturb?

352
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm your boyfriend, not an outsider.

353
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,440
That's good.

354
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,120
Don't worry.

355
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,039
Come on.

356
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,720
And cooked this specially for you.

357
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,559
Congee with Minced Pork and Preserved Egg

358
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,480
eat it while it's still hot.

359
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,240
Thank you.

360
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,360
If you really can't eat, then just forget it.

361
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,759
It just occurred to me

362
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,360
In all my life,

363
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,320
my father never made me

364
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,440
any meal for me.

365
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,799
Even a mouthful of porridge

366
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,679
or soup,

367
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,559
I didn't find any.

368
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,120
Not really.

369
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,559
He made me something

370
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,720
for me this morning.

371
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,639
But I didn't manage to eat it.

372
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,279
I thought

373
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,879
he meant to cook a meal for me.

374
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,759
Who knows,

375
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,919
for 1 million yuan?

376
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,440
For one million yuan?

377
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,879
Like this.

378
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,279
In the future,

379
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,120
give it to me

380
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,159
please leave it to me.

381
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,640
I miss Qin and Mom.

382
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,799
Something happened

383
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,880
these days.

384
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,359
I missed you and mom so much.

385
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,920
How are you?

386
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,759
What are you thinking?

387
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,759
I'm thinking

388
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,200
If that's what happened to Qin,

389
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
he might indulge her.

390
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,119
Could you please go to bed?

391
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,119
Don't think about it.

392
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,559
It's so comfortable here.

393
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,039
Right.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,480
Sometimes,

395
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,559
when I'm upset,

396
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
you usually come here

397
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,440
to enjoy the sea breeze.

398
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,920
This way,

399
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,359
no matter how unhappy you are,

400
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,920
you will forget all about it.

401
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,279
How about this?

402
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,519
Let me put on a show for you.

403
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,559
Do you want to see it?

404
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,559
What?

405
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,599
I have horns on my head.

406
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,359
And tails behind me.

407
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
No one knows

408
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,599
how many secrets I have.

409
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,480
Are you happy now?

410
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,440
Come on,

411
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,680
anything else you want to do?

412
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,359
I'll be with you.

413
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,759
I'll leave you alone

414
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,400
Is all yours.

415
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,119
Anything.

416
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I might not be able to do that.

417
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
A man can't say he's incompetent.

418
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,079
Do you dare to come?

419
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,880
So what?

420
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,000
Who is afraid of this?

421
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,279
Well, now you only resort to

422
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,359
when it comes to finding girlfriends.

423
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,759
Girls love

424
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,720
like this kind of boyfriend.

425
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,839
How powerful.

426
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,839
Don't you think

427
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,599
too fast.

428
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,000
What? Mr. Mu is scared?

429
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,519
Who's scared?

430
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm just afraid you'll get the ticket for speeding.

431
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,079
I promised

432
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,440
that I took you for a ride.

433
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,119
How did you become like this?

434
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
You're really embarrassing me.

435
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,279
But I think you've made

436
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,440
this progress.

437
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,039
Do you remember the first time

438
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,200
when I drove you for a drag race.

439
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,759
Your reaction was

440
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,559
more drastic.

441
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
He who gets close to vermilion becomes red.

442
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
We've been together for such a long time,

443
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,319
I always need a upgrade.

444
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,079
I'll learn from you.

445
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,440
But Doctor Su,

446
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,200
how many surprises do you have?

447
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,440
That I don't know.

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
You'll find it

449
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
you'll find that

450
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,319
but there are more than

451
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,680
there are not only surprises

452
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,519
but also scare.

453
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,039
Just like yesterday.

454
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,200
Those from yesterday

455
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,200
are nothing

456
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
means nothing.

457
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,559
Even in the future,

458
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,359
and frightened,

459
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,279
I'm not scared, either.

460
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,559
To accompany you.

461
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,200
But I'm worried.

462
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,200
About what?

463
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,440
He didn't get any money

464
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,519
he didn't get any money from us.

465
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,359
I'm worried

466
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,759
what surprise

467
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,079
he will bring to us.

468
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,079
Hey.

469
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,400
Hello, Little Su.

470
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,119
Something's wrong.

471
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,799
What happened?

472
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,599
Your father contacted many media

473
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,720
they want to expose your stuff.

474
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,720
He's probably going to

475
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,640
that you're not Xiao Jin

476
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,400
the secret?

477
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,559
Pick me up.

478
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,599
I'll send you the address.

479
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
What's up

480
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,359
nothing.

481
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,400
It's urgent at the company. I need to go home.

482
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll send you back.

483
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,519
Fang Xie will come to pick me up.

484
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,960
Thank you for today.

485
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,200
Today I'm going to share

486
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,680
the unknown information about Su Jin.

487
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,799
When everyone is here,

488
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,680
I'll tell them

489
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
how long will it take?

490
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,279
Hold on.

491
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,920
Miss Su,

492
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,119
he just wants money, right?

493
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,240
Just give it to him.

494
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,640
It's not like we can't afford it.

495
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,519
Fang Xie,

496
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,960
the more I indulge him, the more outrageous he is.

497
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,279
If he holds this,

498
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:32,799
and threatened us

499
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,640
ten million. One hundred million.

500
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Will you give me one too?

501
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,960
That can't be.

502
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,319
He's your father after all.

503
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,000
He is my father.

504
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,319
He is more of a gambler.

505
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,720
You should never have any hope

506
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,119
with a gambler.

507
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,440
That will only make you despair.

508
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,000
Then what should we do now?

509
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,000
You prepare the press release

510
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,920
miss Su, what do you want?

511
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,720
You won't do that.

512
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Instead of letting him threaten us,

513
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
I'd better personally

514
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,480
to block his path.

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,680
That's about

516
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,079
do you need me to repeat it?

517
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,359
What are you talking about?

518
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
What exactly

519
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,519
the exposé,

520
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,799
stop asking questions.

521
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,599
Give me the computer.

522
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
Actually,

523
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,279
I've always wanted to tell you that

524
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,680
a big secret of my daughter Su Jin

525
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
a big secret.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,279
Since it is my secret,

527
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,119
It should be me to tell.

528
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,519
Miss Su! Miss SU!

529
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,440
Didn't I already tell you

530
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,039
If there's anything,

531
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,000
and face it with you.

532
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,480
I've always wanted to.

533
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,519
To tell the reporters

534
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,440
to the reporters.

535
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
What? Tell me.

536
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,559
This girl

537
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
she sometimes

538
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,559
act as if

539
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,839
as if nothing is bothering you.

540
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,000
♪ As if the sky has collapsed ♪

541
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,640
In every aspect.

542
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,759
There are times

543
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,960
she'd be scared.

544
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,279
Of what?

545
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,359
Of what?

546
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,480
It was a very dark day

547
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,400
It was very dark that day.

548
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,440
There was thunder and lightning.

549
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,039
Which of you can come now

550
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,759
please tell me

551
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,079
what's going on?

552
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,559
I know him very well.

553
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,119
He will never change his words

554
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,640
he will never change his word.

555
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,880
Don't look at me.

556
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,920
It really wasn't me.

557
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,759
Why don't you go back first?

558
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,559
When did you give him the money?

559
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,480
After you left,

560
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,440
this is between me and him.

561
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,200
You shouldn't make the decision

562
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,319
without asking after me.

563
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,200
And this is a blackmail crime.

564
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,960
The more you indulge him,

565
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,799
the more he'll be insatiable.

566
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,559
You know that?

567
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,440
I don't want to

568
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,960
to see you being embarrassed.

569
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,160
My identity will be exposed sooner or later.

570
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,119
The media and netizens

571
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,319
I'll have to face it sooner or later.

572
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,960
That's right.

573
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,559
Su Jishi is really brave.

574
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,480
You're fearless.

575
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,000
But as your boyfriend,

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,319
In my own way,

577
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,400
to avoid you and your dad

578
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
In the most embarrassing way.

579
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,720
I didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,799
You don't need protection from your boyfriend.

581
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,599
To do with you.

582
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,799
It's my business

583
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,519
Is my own business.

584
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,200
I've never indulged anyone.

585
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,720
If I have to say it,

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,519
I only indulge myself.

587
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,160
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

588
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,839
Sorry, I'm so confused right now.

589
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,200
I want to be alone.

590
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,599
The money...

591
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,599
I'll also ask Fang Jie

592
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,759
return it to you as soon as possible.

593
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,680
Ji Shi,

594
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,000
what are you doing here?

595
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,359
You think blackmail works?

596
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,559
One million isn't enough.

597
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,720
You want 10 million?

598
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,759
But I haven't spent any money.

599
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,759
Now I will return your money intact.

600
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,400
You've completely passed my test.

601
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,039
What are you doing?

602
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,119
This boy

603
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,160
he was in a relationship with Xiao Jin at first.

604
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,839
Now she is with you.

605
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Can I be at ease?

606
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,480
So I'll try him out for you.

607
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,960
Not really.

608
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,160
This kid can stand the test.

609
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
What do you mean?

610
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,920
I just want to see

611
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,359
can protect you

612
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,079
In such a situation.

613
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,519
Certainly.

614
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,519
Even if I don't get the money,

615
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,680
I wouldn't say anything

616
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,359
In front of the media.

617
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,839
It's been so many years.

618
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,160
You haven't changed at all.

619
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,759
No matter what you do,

620
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,799
you've done too much,

621
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,559
she's always saying she's doing this for me.

622
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,079
When I was six years old,

623
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:29,960
you took all the money

624
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,079
all our money for gambling

625
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,759
you said it was for the good of Xiao Jin and me.

626
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,759
We divorced when we were eight.

627
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,240
And you said it was for our own good.

628
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,319
At the age of 18,

629
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,279
I chose geology.

630
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,000
And you tried your best to stop me.

631
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,079
And you said it was for my own good.

632
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,519
I had my reasons

633
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,160
I have my reasons.

634
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,640
I'm really tired of listening to these words.

635
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,519
This child...

636
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,759
How about

637
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,640
we go out for a drink?

638
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,799
Alright.

639
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,599
No matter what,

640
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,799
let's have another glass.

641
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,799
From now on,

642
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,000
take care of my daughter.

643
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,920
I will leave if you

644
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,119
and hurt her,

645
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
I won't spare you.

646
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,880
I'll treat her well.

647
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,839
Don't worry.

648
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,480
What a child.

649
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
Please be patient with her.

650
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,839
She's hot-tempered and impatient.

651
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,599
She would go out usually

652
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,519
will be bitten by a dog

653
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,799
to bite back.

654
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,559
I am worried that she will get loss.

655
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,240
Your description

656
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,799
Is a good description.

657
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,519
But it's not a bad thing.

658
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,759
That means

659
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
her edges and sharp spirits

660
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,519
without being worn down.

661
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,640
This is where she

662
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,519
from the others.

663
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,359
And it's also the reason why

664
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,200
fall in love with her.

665
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,640
I haven't seen her

666
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
for a few years.

667
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,640
I didn't expect the meeting

668
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,759
the same as before.

669
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,480
If you don't mind me asking,

670
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,319
what happened

671
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,759
between you and her?

672
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
She's still resenting me.

673
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,559
But that's what I deserve.

674
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm a sailor.

675
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,519
I spent years at the sea.

676
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,119
At that time,

677
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,240
not much back then.

678
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,920
The two kids at home

679
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,200
have a heavy burden.

680
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,640
His mother and I

681
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
always quarreled

682
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
with each other all the time.

683
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,920
That's why

684
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,400
to be depressed.

685
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,319
I thought

686
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,599
as long as I have money,

687
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,720
everything will be better.

688
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,079
So I took all

689
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,640
to bet

690
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,039
on our own.

691
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,799
Who would have thought

692
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,279
It will be a bottomless pit.

693
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,720
Not only did I not earn money,

694
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,680
you also fell deeper and deeper into it.

695
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,480
It's not that I've never wanted to stop.

696
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,720
But when I

697
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,039
came to my senses,

698
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,920
and my family dispersed.

699
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,319
My daughter is

700
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,799
towards me.

701
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,279
Over the years,

702
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,119
I've owed them a lot of money.

703
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,160
So,

704
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,079
I was afraid to see her.

705
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,160
In case I trouble her.

706
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm also afraid she'll be more upset when she sees me.

707
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,480
But don't worry.

708
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,359
It's been a long time since I bet that

709
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,839
and only recently

710
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,119
I paid off all the debt.

711
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,599
I returned to find Xiao En

712
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,920
to pay a debt.

713
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,599
You won't be implicated for sure.

714
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,240
Understood.

715
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,400
Of course, I know.

716
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,440
After hearing everything you said just now,

717
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,000
I guess that

718
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,599
you already know

719
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,759
your fault long ago.

720
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
It's not too late now that you know it.

721
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,839
It's too late.

722
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,119
Look at me and I,

723
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,640
I can't even

724
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,880
and talk to each other.

725
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,920
You really can't blame her

726
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
you really can't blame her.

727
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,079
You know

728
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,160
her temper.

729
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,440
Hates others

730
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,319
being threatened.

731
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,720
At first,

732
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:22,960
to visit them

733
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,119
to see

734
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,279
with those two sisters.

735
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,519
By the way,

736
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:27,920
also want to

737
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,240
my son.

738
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,599
But I got myself wrong again.

739
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
Come on.

740
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,680
In the future,

741
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,440
don't want to see

742
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,559
an old fellow anymore.

743
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,119
If you want to settle,

744
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,759
I have a piece of advice.

745
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
You can apologize first.

746
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,839
It's not like the thing between us

747
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,279
It's not going to be solved by an apology.

748
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,880
But at least it's a start.

749
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,359
Whether you care about her

750
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,839
or you want to make it up to her,

751
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,440
you need to express it.

752
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
It's true that she is

753
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
not sensitive to emotions.

754
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
If you don't express it,

755
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,480
she might not notice it.

756
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,480
She always says

757
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,519
the words of a gambler

758
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,720
are the least trustworthy.

759
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,240
Then use actions.

760
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,559
Sometimes, actions

761
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,759
are more powerful than words.

762
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,599
Your actions.

763
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,440
Of course,

764
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,119
I don't mean what you've done.

765
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,599
My daughter likes you very much.

766
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,079
I'm sure you have

767
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,519
many ideas, right?

768
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,359
Tell me about

769
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,039
usually,

770
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,799
you argued with my daughter.

771
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,759
You made her angry.

772
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,359
I know

773
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,599
I'd rather

774
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,000
what? Stop it.

775
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,000
I won't go anywhere.

776
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,440
I want to live with my daughter.

777
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,640
I'll live in a big house.

778
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,799
I'll live in my daughter's

779
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,519
what's wrong?

780
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm too anxious to drink.

781
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,319
Take me back.

782
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,880
I'll stay with you.

783
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,599
I brought him here

784
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,960
to ask for your opinion.

785
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,319
If you don't want to,

786
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,240
I can ask Uncle

787
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,160
stay at my place for a few days.

788
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,319
Honey,

789
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,759
let's go home.

790
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,240
Take me home.

791
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,680
Let him sleep in the second bedroom.

792
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,240
Alright.

793
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,559
Come on.

794
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,920
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

795
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Didn't you also drink?

796
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,440
How can I go back?

797
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,079
We can get a designated driver.

798
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,880
If I can't,

799
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
I'll ask Secretary Gao to pick me up.

800
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,599
I'll go down with you.

801
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,519
No need.

802
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
I need to go to the supermarket downstairs

803
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,400
to buy sober candy for my dad.

804
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,760
Weren't you bought for Uncle?

805
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,000
You had the wine, too.

806
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
No, I'll take it.

807
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,679
You're not mad anymore?

808
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,519
I know you're protecting me.

809
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,320
It's just that I was so angry back then.

810
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,480
I was embarrassed as well.

811
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,880
At least the result is good.

812
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm just thinking about

813
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,039
some of my memories

814
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,920
In my childhood.

815
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,719
You can tell me?

816
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,000
I remember that

817
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,760
I was just seven or eight years old.

818
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,679
Before my parents separated,

819
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,119
my mom had me go to the casino

820
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,800
to go to the casino

821
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
to ask my dad to come home.

822
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,480
When I got there,

823
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,840
filled with smoke.

824
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,559
It's like the Dragon Palace of the East Sea.

825
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,440
But couldn't find him at all.

826
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,440
When I was young, my teacher asked me

827
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,480
he asked me if your grades were so good.

828
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,239
How did your parents raise you?

829
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,679
I cried and told her that

830
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,199
I couldn't see my dad at all.

831
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,639
I can't see him in the morning...

832
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,880
Or at night.

833
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,280
I couldn't see him for the whole time.

834
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,519
That's why when I was little,

835
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,239
when I was little.

836
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,440
Other kids

837
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,519
I really hope

838
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,960
when to bring my dad back

839
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,480
during the New Year.

840
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,440
Or to set off fireworks

841
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,440
or to eat.

842
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,639
But he never managed to

843
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
now he's suddenly

844
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,239
coming back like this.

845
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,000
How could I

846
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,840
as nothing

847
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,039
as if nothing has happened.

848
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,079
I'll take you to a place.

849
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,079
You secretly bought this

850
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,119
at the grocery store.

851
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,000
Take this.

852
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,559
Show you a helicopter?

853
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,400
A little dizzy.

854
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
Although it can't make up for

855
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,760
for the lack of your childhood,

856
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,920
but at least now I see your smile.

857
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,559
Mu Huron.

858
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,679
Did anyone tell you that

859
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,119
you are really very good.

860
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,280
No, I'm not.

861
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:40,800
If I remember correctly,

862
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,480
someone even

863
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,639
saying I'm nosy.

864
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,639
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,360
Take back your angry words.

866
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,480
When I think about it now,

867
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
If I could meet you

868
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,039
and met you earlier.

869
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,440
In fact, no matter how late it is,

870
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,440
the most important thing is to cherish now.

871
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,760
There are many times

872
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,679
people and things are like

873
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,760
the fireworks

874
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,639
and gone so suddenly.

875
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,599
So you should cherish it

876
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,840
you should cherish it

877
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,119
so that you won't regret it later.

878
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,880
What do you think?

879
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,320
What's wrong? You burned yourself?

880
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,199
Just teasing you.

881
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,440
Huron.

882
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,199
Come down.

883
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,960
We're leaving.

884
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,480
Hello, Uncle.

885
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,719
Little Mu.

886
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,000
You told me that

887
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
as long as I cater to her pleasure,

888
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,239
she might forgive me.

889
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Is it true?

890
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Of course it is real.

891
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,079
Little Jin

892
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,679
has always liked the geology major.

893
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,840
You hindered her before

894
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,320
have become a knot in her heart.

895
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,719
I think we should

896
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,440
you may start with this aspect.

897
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,480
The geology?

898
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,440
I don't know

899
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,559
geology.

900
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,559
It's fine.

901
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,079
When you have time,

902
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,280
to the wilderness.

903
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280
I think she would

904
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
If she learns the truth.

905
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:25,639
That's right.

906
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,480
She seems to have

907
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,639
who loves to go to the wild.

908
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,360
Okay, I'll hang up now.

909
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,159
I have to go to work.

910
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
We can talk later.

911
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,280
See you. Bye.

912
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
What's missing?

913
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,440
A little stony.

914
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,800
To have some rocks.

915
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,800
You are back

916
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:17,880
come here.

917
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
When I was little,

918
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,199
when I was little.

919
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,760
Lest you burn my kitchen again.

920
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,760
Alright.

921
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,280
Let's put down breakfast.

922
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,400
Come on.

923
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
Let's have a look at this place.

924
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,280
Look at the wild jungle

925
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,639
what I've created for you?

926
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,880
After daily work,

927
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,079
and sat over there

928
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,559
watching the stars in the sky.

929
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,400
Doesn't it sound like that?

930
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,239
Are these

931
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,159
are all your things?

932
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,800
I asked the florist downstairs to send them.

933
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,519
What about

934
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,199
does it look like a jungle?

935
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,599
What? You don't like that?

936
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,599
You broke my fossil.

937
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,559
A fossil?

938
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,119
I guess it's Xiao Mu's fault.

939
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,920
He taught me that.

940
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,639
Yesterday's incident with Mr. Su's live-streaming

941
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,159
has somewhat affected Miss Su.

942
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,920
But luckily,

943
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,599
the reaction of the netizens

944
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,719
Is within my control.

945
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,599
The media feel cheated

946
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,599
felt cheated.

947
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,360
We were a little excited

948
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,519
she needs us to comfort her.

949
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,920
Alright. Handle it for you.

950
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:48,800
Alright.

951
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,239
Uncle.

952
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,360
Xiao Mu.

953
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,880
What a bad idea.

954
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,440
You want me to work harder

955
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,320
on the geology,

956
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,400
but now,

957
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,639
Instead of being upset,

958
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,000
she became even more angry.

959
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
No, Uncle.

960
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,159
I only asked you to put the effort

961
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,119
but not the broken ones.

962
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,840
The fossil she picked

963
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,920
In Lesbos Volcanic Island?

964
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,239
What to do now?

965
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,480
Find a way to remedy the situation.

966
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,079
Light rain.

967
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,119
Do you know why Xiaoman

968
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:30,920
why Xiaoman took a leave recently?

969
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,400
Is she sick?

970
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,000
Sick?

971
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,719
These days, I often see

972
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,079
she was searching

973
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,000
some kind of information recently.

974
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,639
So I doubt that she is...

975
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,320
Hello, are you Xiaoman?

976
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,000
Miss Ningxia?

977
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,280
Call me Ningxia.
