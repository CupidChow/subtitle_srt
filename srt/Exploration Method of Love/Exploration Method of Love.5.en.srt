1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,400
I was determined to take every step

2
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,640
was to get closer to you.

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
I can't hide...

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,159
My love for you anymore.

5
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,879
Why does my heart beat faster

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,599
whenever I think of her?

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,799
Am I only 70

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,199
Only 70?

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
That's impossible.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
How could I fall in love with her?

11
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,680
A mine.

12
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,280
Two mines.

13
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Three mines.

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,719
♪ Longing for each other ♪

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
♪ Want to touch it ♪

16
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,840
But you're withdrawn.

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
This is the feeling of love.

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,159
But it's not

19
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,479
why?

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Why did most of the book

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
but it's painful.

22
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,840
How about this time?

23
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,759
Sis,

24
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,240
I think you're a fan girl

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,840
I think you can do anything.

26
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,039
As long as your face is handsome.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
That's right.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,199
No, not like that.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
This performance

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,639
In the future,

31
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,639
to learn from me.

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
I just have to record a few lines.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,319
We don't have to do this.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,319
It's already five o'clock...

35
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,439
It's five o'clock.

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,240
Alright.

37
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,800
Go to bed.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400
Alright.

39
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,159
And 7,998 mines.

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
And 7,999 mines,

41
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,599
and 8,000 mines.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,919
Hey, Gao Ling.

43
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,159
Send me the information

44
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,000
for tomorrow's meeting.

45
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,840
Right now?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you alright, Mr. Mu?

47
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,840
You're the Great Madam,

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,000
and get up at six.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,159
Why are you so abnormal today?

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,319
Who is abnormal?

51
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,120
How am I abnormal?

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,439
I've always been like this.

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,599
You have a problem

54
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,479
with temporary overtime?

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,719
I thought Miss Su

56
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,240
to irritate you.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,919
Who?

58
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,240
Who can stimulate me?

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,159
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,520
Stop this nonsense.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,159
Arabian nights

62
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,800
how could I be stimulated

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
so many mines.

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,719
The 8,002 mines

65
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,520
can reach 15 to 200,000 tons.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
The annual interest rate is about

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,439
from 100 to 130 million yuan.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,519
Mr. Mu.

69
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,120
No. No. No.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,040
Why?

71
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,680
Everything went well.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Mr. Mu is not optimistic.

73
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,399
Mr. Mu.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,199
A one-billion yuan investment.

75
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,439
Then why not?

76
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,480
Keep pushing it.

77
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,360
Why?

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
My heart fluttering?

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
♪ Longing ♪

80
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,399
♪ Even though you want to touch it, you withdraw your hand ♪

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
That's exactly

82
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,879
the feeling of falling in love.

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,439
But why

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,199
why did most of the rest

85
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,399
but suffering.

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,839
Your ears are so red.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,480
Are you alright?

88
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
The heart rate is so high.

89
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,480
Can it be broken?

90
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,079
This is broken.

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,959
It's not broken.

92
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,959
It functions normally.

93
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,319
I think

94
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,199
you're a little abnormal.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,240
You

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,759
something to report?

97
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,319
Get out now.

98
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,079
I...

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Nothing serious.

100
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,199
I am not normal.

101
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,519
Are you kidding me?

102
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,399
What am I?

103
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,879
I am Mu Huron.

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,120
Will I be affected?

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
No, I won't.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,439
Our cooperation clearly states

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,360
that we can't

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,439
let the other party

109
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,040
mr. Mu,

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,839
how is your

111
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,680
what do you think?

112
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,879
Are you very tempting?

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,639
Do you have the feeling?

114
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
This is the line

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,519
tomorrow.

116
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,839
It took me long to practice.

117
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,480
Hurry up.

118
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Use the power

119
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
of your sharp-tongued.

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Is your sharp-tongued.

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
That doesn't sound like anything.

122
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,040
As for me,

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,839
don't have any feelings.

124
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,639
You said no,

125
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
but I will practice until

126
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,040
until you have feelings for it.

127
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,639
If you're upset,

128
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,279
you can bully me all you want.

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Anyway,

130
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,279
I really like you.

131
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,639
How could she

132
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,439
say something like that so casually?

133
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,759
I wasn't the kind of person

134
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
a person who can be hidden.

135
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
You can't hide it with your eyes,

136
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,279
your mouth can't be hidden.

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
My feelings for you can't be hidden either.

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
All I want to do is

139
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
sweet words.

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,279
You want me to be affected?

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,399
That's impossible.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,439
Su Jin, let me warn you.

143
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,839
Stop already.

144
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,240
When I finally

145
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,040
when there is no turning back in life

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
only when I know

147
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,279
what I once gave up

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
that we would never meet

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,800
will not meet again.

150
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Mr. Mu,

151
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,319
report something to me,

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:13,959
leave if you have nothing to do.

153
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,199
You're so short-tempered.

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,519
Your mom asked you to report to her

155
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,600
to report to her this afternoon.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,639
She is going to hold

157
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,519
a family party tomorrow.

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Do you want to call Miss Su?

159
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,199
No need.

160
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,439
It's Mr. Mu.

161
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm afraid Aunt Hua will be suspicious

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,439
I'm afraid Aunt Hua will be suspicious.

163
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,839
I know why.

164
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,839
And also

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,439
don't mention Su Jin

166
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,000
to mention Su Jin.

167
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,639
I don't want to see her.

168
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,839
I don't want to hear anything from her.

169
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:49,959
Understood.

170
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,319
Mr. Mu.

171
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,959
This...

172
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,240
It was an illusion.

173
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
It must be an illusion.

174
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
Why are you so late?

175
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,240
What are you doing here?

176
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,800
Didn't you ask me to come?

177
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,399
When did I ask you to come?

178
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,120
You didn't ask me to come.

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Do you think

180
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,360
Is it too bad

181
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
they are all here.

182
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,320
Mother.

183
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Why are you standing here?

184
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,919
Go in.

185
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,960
Come on.

186
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,200
Come on.

187
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Come on, Little Jin.

188
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,559
Come on, Jin.

189
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,480
Sit inside.

190
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,720
What exactly happened?

191
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,919
She added me on WeChat and said she is your assistant,

192
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,000
telling me to eat at this address.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
And I came here immediately.

194
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,919
Mr. Mu, I have the question to ask you.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,039
I sent you so many messages.

196
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,840
Why didn't you reply?

197
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,519
Checking your phone while walking?

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
You talk about work every day?

199
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,480
They talk about work all the time.

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
It was hard for me

201
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,039
to ask you and Xiao Jin to come back.

202
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,639
Can't you put off work first?

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
You wouldn't listen to me anyway.

204
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,919
Little Jin,

205
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,879
sit for a while.

206
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,200
I'll prepare tea.

207
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,080
Alright.

208
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,480
There was no prior communication.

209
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,639
My responsibility?

210
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,879
Forget about it.

211
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,639
You also helped me on the set the other day.

212
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,679
So I had a meal with your mom.

213
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,639
I can handle it.

214
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,840
Do you think it's hard

215
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
for a meal?

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,679
It suddenly occurred to me that

217
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,559
to have an acting class.

218
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,240
See you later.

219
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,080
It's pointless.

220
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,399
Since she asked you to come,

221
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,120
It means

222
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,200
has already found out

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,759
you'll be fine in the next few days.

224
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,879
If you leave now,

225
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,200
what?

226
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,159
I'll breach the contract.

227
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,200
Great suggestion.

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,519
How about this?

229
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Please help me

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,679
with my mom.

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,399
And handle this family gathering successfully.

232
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,159
I'll cooperate with you.

233
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,320
10% of your original share

234
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,159
as the bonus.

235
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,720
You don't want to do it?

236
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,840
It's too risky.

237
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,840
A 20%...

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,639
A 30%...

239
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,399
And it only seems to

240
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,399
to help you deal with your mother.

241
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,879
Don't think about any other.

242
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,679
That's fine with me

243
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
enjoy our cooperation, Mr. Mu.

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
The one in the back is good.

245
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,679
Got it.

246
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,240
Son!

247
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:54,799
One, two, three.

248
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,360
Laugh.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
One, two, three.

250
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,240
Laugh.

251
00:10:59,279 --> 00:10:59,559
Come.

252
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,679
Change some poses.

253
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,039
Then change some beautiful poses.

254
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,360
Little Jin.

255
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,159
You are a superstar?

256
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:11,519
Come on.

257
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,559
Let me teach you.

258
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,519
One is...

259
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,639
The other is tilted.

260
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,759
The other side is against it.

261
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,399
Got it?

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,600
That's it.

263
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,000
Come on.

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,799
Let me have a look.

265
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,120
Come on. Right.

266
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Put your left hand on your chest.

267
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,039
That's right.

268
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,039
It's beautiful.

269
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,840
Huron.

270
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,399
Where are your hands?

271
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,080
Hands. Hands.

272
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
Put your arms around your waist.

273
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,399
Put your arms around my waist.

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,600
One, two, three.

275
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,120
Son.

276
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,799
Smile.

277
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,960
Great.

278
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,639
Take a look up

279
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,840
one, two, three.

280
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,399
Come on.

281
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,159
Another one.

282
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,000
Change your pose.

283
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's have a look.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,879
The Titanic.

285
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
There is a girl in front.

286
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,440
Silly son.

287
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,120
What happened?

288
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,879
I'm even nervous when taking pictures. Look.

289
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,440
Look, the bow.

290
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
You should see the sea breeze in front of you,

291
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,559
and look at each other affectionately.

292
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,559
And look at each other.

293
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
And look into each other's eyes.

294
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,960
And look into each other's eyes.

295
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes, there it is.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
One, two, three, son.

297
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,679
And affectionate.

298
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,399
Son.

299
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Your little hands come here.

300
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,799
Come on,

301
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,399
It's perfect after adjusting.

302
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,720
That's right.

303
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,840
The last pose.

304
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,879
The one in Romeo and Juliet.

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,120
The one who stooped down and looked at each other affectionately?

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,000
Come on.

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,679
Come on.

308
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,440
You youngsters

309
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,720
you're the best with your moves.

310
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,440
Huron.

311
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
What about your hand?

312
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,440
Right.

313
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,120
Right.

314
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,639
Waist down.

315
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:23,919
Lower.

316
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,600
Waist. Waist. Waist.

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And look at each other with affection.

318
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,759
One two three.

319
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's do a head-up shot.

320
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,440
Hang in there.

321
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,960
Son, hold on.

322
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,720
Hold on.

323
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,840
It's so beautiful.

324
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
Only beautiful!

325
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,559
Beautiful!

326
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,519
Natural and unrestrained.

327
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,879
Here it is.

328
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm going to use a filter.

329
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll use the filter.

330
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey.

331
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,840
I don't care

332
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,679
hate me personally,

333
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,440
but since I've promised

334
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,200
to help you with this act.

335
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I hope you can be more cooperative.

336
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,240
Can you be more professional?

337
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,679
You are not that professional either.

338
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
Why am I sweating so much?

339
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
Abandon me?

340
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,399
Something's wrong.

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,559
What are you waiting for?

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,759
Come and sit.

343
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,759
Alright, mother.

344
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,559
You know what?

345
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,679
They are great!

346
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
Little Jin.

347
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,200
Huron is always too busy

348
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,440
he rarely accompanies you.

349
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,000
Would you blame him?

350
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,679
Of course I won't.

351
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,399
Aunty Hua.

352
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,440
We've discussed this.

353
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,279
We should focus on our career.

354
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,960
Young people should put their careers first.

355
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a good thing.

356
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,200
How did you two

357
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,080
communicate with each other?

358
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,039
Our phones,

359
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,279
and chat videos.

360
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
So what did you talk about?

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
We...

362
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,440
Right.

363
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,320
Aunt Hua.

364
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,480
We talked about everything except work.

365
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,879
To others,

366
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,879
he has always been

367
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,279
very serious.

368
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,879
But in private,

369
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,039
a completely different person.

370
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
Especially when I was working.

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
He asked to video chat with me every day.

372
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,799
He wouldn't let me hang up.

373
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,960
They can't even

374
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,559
he wants me to take photos

375
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,919
every day.

376
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,600
Other times,

377
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
If I replied it late,

378
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,120
he would send me

379
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,320
the cute dog emoji.

380
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,360
He knows this?

381
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,720
Mom,

382
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,919
I'm going to the bathroom.

383
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,759
Alright.

384
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,399
Everyone is disgusting.

385
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:56,879
Come on, Xiao Jin.

386
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,600
Eat the fruit.

387
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,639
Alright.

388
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Little Jin.

389
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,080
Do you like durian?

390
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,840
Certainly.

391
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Aunt Hua, you like it too?

392
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,320
Just eat.

393
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,559
Isn't Huron unable to smell

394
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,399
the smell?

395
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,399
It was like this at the beginning.

396
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,159
He's changed now.

397
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,600
That's Huron.

398
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,440
Little Jin told me that

399
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
because of her,

400
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,519
you even fell in love with Durian.

401
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,039
Only because of her,

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,240
and hate her.

403
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I can't say I like her.

404
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,519
What's so great if you don't hate her?

405
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,519
Let me take a picture of you.

406
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,840
Record the highlight moment

407
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,279
when you grew up for love.

408
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,279
Come on.

409
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,559
Son.

410
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,039
Let's eat.

411
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,159
Come on.

412
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,799
Hurry up.

413
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,759
Eat, son.

414
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,519
One, two, three.

415
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,360
Eat.

416
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,080
This power of love

417
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,639
Is simply too great.

418
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,360
I thought I didn't hate him anymore.

419
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,639
He...

420
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,799
Always so stubborn.

421
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,080
That's how

422
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,720
very touched.

423
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,679
OK.

424
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,440
I have to hurry.

425
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,799
Huron.

426
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,919
What are you doing?

427
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,320
Let Xiaojin have some water.

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,159
Little Jin.

429
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,320
You and Huron

430
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,679
for three years.

431
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,519
Now you also proposed to each other.

432
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,159
It must be that you have

433
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,200
of each other.

434
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,720
Right?

435
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,840
That's for sure.

436
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,919
That will be great.

437
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,799
Come on.

438
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Little Jin.

439
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
These photos

440
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,240
these are Huron's

441
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,159
these years.

442
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
To help Ms. Hua.

443
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
To recall our memories.

444
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,160
Come on.

445
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,880
This is Mu's Group.

446
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,960
Was just handed to Huron.

447
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,000
Soon after that, right?

448
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,319
Huron told me that

449
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,200
he had just graduated for two years

450
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,440
In order to bluff the old foxes

451
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
to bluff the company.

452
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,799
He only wore black clothes

453
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,000
every day when he went to the mine.

454
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,359
Keep a strict smile. Hold the assembly.

455
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,119
That's right.

456
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,359
That's right.

457
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,680
Let me have a look.

458
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,079
This...

459
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,240
What happened to this photo?

460
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,480
This...

461
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
The laterite and nickel ore in State E

462
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,599
was discussed by Huron

463
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,960
about a year ago.

464
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,599
I remember

465
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,200
when you were there,

466
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,599
the volcano erupted.

467
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,799
Where's Mu?

468
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
With the international emergency rescue.

469
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Many local refugees

470
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
to the local area.

471
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,720
That's right.

472
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Right?

473
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,119
That's right.

474
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,680
Luckily, he gave me some

475
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,319
some information

476
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,319
personal interview information

477
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,079
about Mu Huron's company.

478
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,000
They can even fool people with half-truths.

479
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,200
No one

480
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,720
everyone knows

481
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,680
although I don't understand the feelings

482
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
the feelings of this album.

483
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,160
But I'm sure Huron has told you

484
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,240
after all,

485
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,920
this is his favorite thing.

486
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,480
Look at this.

487
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,680
Tell Aunt Hua

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,599
mom,

489
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,240
I recorded this

490
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,599
on my way to Xinjiang

491
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,319
do you think Xiao Jin

492
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,640
Is not a geology major,

493
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
even if I told her,

494
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,279
she forgot as well?

495
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,119
That's not true.

496
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,480
I remember them all.

497
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,400
Not to mention

498
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,799
you two lovebirds don't share

499
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,960
don't share your love with each other, okay?

500
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,359
How is that possible?

501
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,759
I don't think I can live till tomorrow.

502
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,960
I mean that Xiao Jin

503
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,440
she is sometimes

504
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,720
that she isn't interested in.

505
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,640
It's easy for her to forget them.

506
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,839
How could I not remember?

507
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,240
This is

508
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,359
Is the

509
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,440
the Keketuohai seismic fault zone.

510
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,000
Back in 1931,

511
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,559
an magnitude 8 earthquake

512
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
an magnitude 8 earthquake occurred.

513
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,039
Because there are few human traces,

514
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,160
and precipitation is rare,

515
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,359
that's why we have perfectly preserved

516
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,759
the earthquake fault zone

517
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,759
extending for more than 150 kilometers.

518
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
It is of great

519
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,720
of great geological research value.

520
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,480
It is a unique geological wonder

521
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,240
In the world.

522
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,680
I mean, that's what Huron

523
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,119
that's what Huron told me.

524
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,920
Little Jin.

525
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,200
Why is she so concerned

526
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,279
to my matters?

527
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,559
Oh, good memory!

528
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,440
You have such a good memory.

529
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,960
Goodness!

530
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,079
Mom.

531
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,599
Little Jin.

532
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,559
She has not only a good memory,

533
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,759
she is also an excellent cook.

534
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,759
She said today that

535
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,960
that she would

536
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
and show you my skills.

537
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,039
Mu Huron is really something.

538
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,319
You did it on purpose.

539
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,839
Do you still want to get away or not?

540
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,759
Hey,

541
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
she is a guest in our house.

542
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,559
How can you let her work in the kitchen?

543
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,759
What do you mean by guests?

544
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,559
She's our family.

545
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,119
Making a meal for her family

546
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,039
that's normal, right?

547
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,559
Huron is right.

548
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,039
But usually Huron

549
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,599
usually, Huron is the chef.

550
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,920
I just can

551
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
helping hand.

552
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,839
Really?

553
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,839
Right?

554
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,319
Alright.

555
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm glad the two of you are filial.

556
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,160
I'll wait and see.

557
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,559
The delicious meal you cook.

558
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
Alright.

559
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,119
Miss Su has no interest

560
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,359
your research in geology

561
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,640
Is way beyond

562
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,319
to my imagination.

563
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,720
Which movie?

564
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
From a play?

565
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,119
I am really curious about

566
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,440
which book is it?

567
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,079
The "Keketuohai" notebook.

568
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
This is just my hobby.

569
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,799
Don't think too much.

570
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
You and I both

571
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
happen to be interested in this.

572
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,960
I don't have any feelings for you.

573
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,240
That's good.

574
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,000
You can start now.

575
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,559
Do it yourself if you want to.

576
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,559
I'm not interested.

577
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:12,880
What?

578
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,039
In the past two years, the reputation of

579
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,359
widely spread in the past two years

580
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,039
Is fake too, right?

581
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,599
That's ridiculous.

582
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,839
It's impossible.

583
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,319
Little Jin.

584
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:25,960
Let me help you.

585
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,279
Come on.

586
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,039
What happened

587
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,240
mu Hurun, what are you doing?

588
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,279
My mom is back there.

589
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you, honey.

590
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Go on.

591
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Let's make it.

592
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,759
And egg with tomatoes.

593
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,160
Let's make vinegar sauce and shredded potato.

594
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,200
So this is the so-called good cook?

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,279
What matters is that they taste good.

596
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,680
That's not the point.

597
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,359
Are you all right?

598
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,359
Why don't you let Ms. Zhang help?

599
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,200
Mom, why are you here?

600
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,960
Wait outside.

601
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,480
Aunt Hua, no.

602
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,480
You may continue with your work.

603
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,720
They all say it's for continuation food

604
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,519
made by overseas students.

605
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,640
It is delicious stir-fried with any dish.

606
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
Although I haven't made them many times,

607
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
but I don't think it will happen.

608
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,160
Hold on.

609
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,039
It's broken.

610
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,759
They didn't put any salt in it.

611
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,680
Little salt mine?

612
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,200
Don't think that just because you've become

613
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,039
doesn't mean that I don't know you.

614
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,519
Alright.

615
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,039
You win.

616
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,279
As for the rest,

617
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,519
I will do it.

618
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,680
Alright.

619
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:42,880
Please try

620
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,680
try the first meal

621
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,440
the first meal they made for me.

622
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,079
Alright.

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
Hold on.

624
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,039
I'll take a photo and post it to my Moments.

625
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,400
To show them.

626
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
Is not a fake relationship at all.

627
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:57,799
Mother.

628
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:58,720
Brother,

629
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm back

630
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,799
baby,

631
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,000
are you off duty

632
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,799
have you eaten?

633
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't want to eat. I've got no appetite.

634
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,279
Su Jin,

635
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,839
why are you here?

636
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
What are you

637
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,000
call me sister-in-law.

638
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,519
Whatever.

639
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,359
I'm going back to the room.

640
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,519
I don't know what happened.

641
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,720
Enjoy yourselves.

642
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,599
I'll go and have a look.

643
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,480
Xiaoman.

644
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,079
This again?

645
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,960
Baby,

646
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,680
what happened again?

647
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,279
Hello?

648
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,559
I just went out.

649
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,480
Hey.

650
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,359
I just went out.

651
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm driving now.

652
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,160
On the road.

653
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:48,440
Alright.

654
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,359
Wait for me.

655
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:49,799
Wait for me.

656
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,200
I'll go out to play for a while.

657
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Enjoy yourselves.

658
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,599
Your sister looks sad.

659
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,920
Don't you go to console her?

660
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,480
It's nothing serious.

661
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,880
She's always been like this.

662
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,720
It won't take long.

663
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,880
Thank you

664
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,119
thank you for your hard work.

665
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,319
OK.

666
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,559
But Mr. Mu,

667
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,519
over the years,

668
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,240
why did you have to lie to your mom?

669
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,240
In these three years,

670
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
you could find someone

671
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,720
with someone you really like.

672
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,759
Is too high.

673
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,599
To know and get along

674
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,759
cooperation and commitment.

675
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,880
And an independent person.

676
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,759
When we got married,

677
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,759
every step we have been through

678
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,039
every step you take.

679
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,519
And start all over again.

680
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,880
Once you've anticipated this,

681
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm not in the mood for love anymore.

682
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,920
I don't understand anything.

683
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,720
I think the process is the most important

684
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
the process that

685
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,839
the only thing that gives people pleasure

686
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,759
Is not the final breakup

687
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,839
or marriage.

688
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,039
The result.

689
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,599
Then tell me,

690
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,880
a fruitless road.

691
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,640
Why bother?

692
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,960
As long as you bring

693
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,920
compass, hammer, magnifying glass,

694
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,839
I can make a path even if there's no path.

695
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,039
Alright.

696
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,640
Got it.

697
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:15,960
Thank you.

698
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,160
I will be there right now.

699
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,400
Mu Xiaoman,

700
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
where are you going?

701
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:22,599
Brother.

702
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,480
You've been talking for so long.

703
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,039
Can you not let me go?

704
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,440
This is non-negotiable.

705
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,279
Go back to your room and sleep now.

706
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
I'll pretend that nothing happened.

707
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,359
Be a good girl.

708
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
Brother, it's not easy for me

709
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,759
so I asked people to find him.

710
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,359
You should let me

711
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,680
and make it clear to him.

712
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,799
What to say?

713
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,880
He broke up with you.

714
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,839
What are you talking about?

715
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,759
Then I also need to know

716
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,200
what did I do wrong?

717
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,119
That's why he broke up with me.

718
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,000
Mu Xiaoman,

719
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,359
got it.

720
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,640
Never say that to me again!

721
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,799
I won't allow you

722
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,160
you're with such a scoundrel,

723
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,839
got it?

724
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,839
What?

725
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
You forced Bai to break up with me.

726
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,720
What are you talking about?

727
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,960
Mu Huron.

728
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
Who are you to interfere with my love life?

729
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,519
I'll say this one more time.

730
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,440
Go back to your room and sleep.

731
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,799
Do you hear me?

732
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:24,640
Three.

733
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,640
Two.

734
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,319
You were never fierce to me before.

735
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,519
Because I've spoiled you since you were little.

736
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,319
That's why you did this.

737
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,720
Go back to your room.

738
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,039
You are my brother,

739
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,160
rather than my father.

740
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,119
Who are you to mind me?

741
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,680
Su Jin.

742
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,119
Su Jin.

743
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,039
Hello, Mr. Mu.

744
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,839
The holiday is over.

745
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,839
Get in position!

746
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,880
Don't think you can get me down

747
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,079
because you brought me out to see Bai.

748
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,359
We are both adults.

749
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,400
How can you let others

750
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,839
Interfere in my own life?

751
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,920
Come on.

752
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,759
No one has an excuse

753
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,759
an excuse to bully us.

754
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,519
What's wrong with you.

755
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,960
It's not what others said.

756
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,039
What others say

757
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,960
Is the truth.

758
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,400
Mu Xiaoman,

759
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,000
are you ready

760
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
to answer your own questions?

761
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,640
Come on.

762
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Come on.

763
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,400
Happy birthday!

764
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,440
White.

765
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,799
Calm down.

766
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,799
It seems your brother wants

767
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,640
to break up with you

768
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,039
although I used the wrong method,

769
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,759
It was considered.

770
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,359
Tell you what.

771
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,079
This man isn't worth

772
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,039
you feel sorry for him?

773
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's go, Xiaoman.

774
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,079
Fang Xiaobai,

775
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,599
I've been so nice to you.

776
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,519
You cheated on me.

777
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,680
Xiaoman,

778
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,400
fang Xiaobai,

779
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,200
who is she?

780
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
She is.

781
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,839
She feels like she has two pennies,

782
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,400
she harassed me at every turn

783
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,160
trying to ruin our relationship.

784
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,559
Xiaoman, you go first.

785
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,440
Don't...

786
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,359
I, Mu Xiaoman, will never

787
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,680
I'd never be humiliated like this.

788
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,319
You have a temper.

789
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,759
And...

790
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,759
It's you again?

791
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,039
It's because you didn't learn a lesson.

792
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,279
Are you alright, Su Jin?

793
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,519
I haven't enjoyed myself enough.

794
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,039
Me too.

795
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:28,880
Having fun?

796
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,119
Let's go first.

797
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,400
Leave the rest to your brother.

798
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,319
I'm not leaving.

799
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:32,960
Stop pulling me.

800
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,559
I told you not to meddle in this.

801
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,920
Are you determined to cause trouble?

802
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,920
Get off.

803
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,599
Xiaoman's feelings

804
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,200
who are you to get the decision for her?

805
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,599
Do you know that

806
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,079
much time and trouble

807
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,200
save her much time and trouble.

808
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,240
If you do this,

809
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,880
xiaoman will never grow up.

810
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,079
You should let her

811
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,440
to go through all these on her own.

812
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,119
To experience all of it.

813
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm her brother.

814
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,400
She met a scumbag.

815
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,880
Was I supposed to watch her get cheated

816
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,359
and watch her suffer more?

817
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,079
You're her brother.

818
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,039
However, you're not God.

819
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,400
You can put the map

820
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,359
of her life.

821
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,519
Tell her how hard

822
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,480
how hard the road ahead is.

823
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,599
But you must not

824
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,160
any of her journey.

825
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,160
You think

826
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,160
an approach that you know is unworkable,

827
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,079
and still insist on taking it.

828
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,960
What's the meaning of it?

829
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,079
It means washing away,

830
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,200
and shaping

831
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,599
do you think a relationship without an end

832
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,480
will lead you astray?

833
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,839
It will only lead to useless wounds.

834
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,759
You're wrong.

835
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,480
Humans are the same as the world.

836
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,880
He brings not only his wounds,

837
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,839
but also a stronger and newer self.

838
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,119
Just like the Hoketuohai

839
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,160
that fault zone.

840
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,240
Is the wound of the Earth.

841
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,039
When it appeared,

842
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,480
keketuohai was there.

843
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
The basin fell,

844
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,599
the river was changed,

845
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,440
and huge stones remade,

846
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,000
where rivers flow into lakes.

847
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,359
Stop interfering in

848
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,480
Interfere in Xiaoman's life anymore.

849
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,839
Only by letting her experience

850
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,039
will she create

851
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,079
a unique style

852
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,960
of her own.

853
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:16,960
Brother.

854
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,720
We can leave now, right?

855
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,400
Come on.

856
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,720
Xiaoman.

857
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,359
I'm sorry.

858
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,279
Scram!

859
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,680
Great!

860
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,480
My hands are a bit dirty.

861
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,720
I need to use the bathroom.

862
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
Do this to this kind of person.

863
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,400
Worth it?

864
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,119
I know he's not.

865
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,960
But it still makes me sad.

866
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,719
You have so many handsome guys around you,

867
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,559
like your brother.

868
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,480
Take after me.

869
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,920
Why are you so obsessed

870
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,880
by him?

871
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,920
All of you are great.

872
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:32,880
But there's no one

873
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,480
needs me as much as he does.

874
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
They cost you money,

875
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
and toil your mind,

876
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,440
that needs you.

877
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,880
The one who really needs you

878
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,679
as long as you are happy

879
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,440
and protect yourself,

880
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:49,880
that's it.

881
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,639
Got it?

882
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,719
What's wrong with your hand?

883
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Nothing.

884
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,679
You fought with that guy?

885
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,000
When

886
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
It is not a fight.

887
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,280
I unilaterally...

888
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,679
And taught him a lesson for you.

889
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,159
Sorry.

890
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,599
I caused you

891
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,239
I brought you so much trouble.

892
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,519
I am here to comfort you.

893
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,119
You cried even more after that.

894
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,280
And let your brother see it.

895
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,719
A month's pay will be deducted.

896
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,880
Sorry.

897
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,679
There, there.

898
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,599
Don't cry.

899
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,800
Why hasn't Xiaoman come out?

900
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,280
You are the older brother.

901
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,840
Shouldn't you go in

902
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,039
and console her?

903
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,159
Is bold.

904
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,679
Don't try to cover your reckless behavior

905
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,280
your reckless behavior.

906
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,760
Your reckless behavior.

907
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,159
Little Su.

908
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,920
Brother.

909
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

910
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,079
To celebrate the end of

911
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,079
today, the end of my first love,

912
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,039
I'll treat everyone to a drink.

913
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,119
You don't return until you get drunk.

914
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,079
I announce that from today on,

915
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,599
from now on.

916
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,559
Is it too late?

917
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,320
I think you should work hard

918
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,840
to get rid of someone.

919
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,599
Be free of someone's clutches?

920
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,280
Don't delay anything.

921
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,719
Career, love and idol.

922
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,679
Three hands.

923
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,239
Let's go and have a drink.

924
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,480
I've had too much schedule lately.

925
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,039
I'm too tired.

926
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,760
I'm not going.

927
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,239
Let your brother drink with you.

928
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,920
You said you wanted to escape from me.

929
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,960
You even asked me to drink.

930
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,960
You have a self-knowledge.

931
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,840
Hello, Mommy.

932
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,840
Xiaoman,

933
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,880
where are you guys?

934
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:31,960
Nothing.

935
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,599
Don't worry about me.

936
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,400
Where are your brother and sister-in-law?

937
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,599
They were gone when I came back

938
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,599
he's gone.

939
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,800
Aunt Hua.

940
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,360
Mom,

941
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,039
don't you two have

942
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,199
to explain to me?

943
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,760
Hurry up.

944
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:46,800
Go home and sleep.

945
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,239
Okay, no problem.

946
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,760
All right, aunt.

947
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,039
Come on.

948
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,199
Come on.

949
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,000
I think I'm drunk.

950
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,239
What are you doing?

951
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,239
Do you want to go home with me

952
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,000
share the same bed and the same pillow

953
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,800
and enjoy a good night with them?

954
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,039
There are no outsiders here.

955
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,000
You don't have to do this.

956
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,960
Xiaoman.

957
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,199
Your sister-in-law just drank too much.

958
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,400
She might throw up if she's in the car.

959
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,440
Let's find a hotel next door.

960
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,119
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

961
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,760
Good night.

962
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,079
We'll have a drink tonight.

963
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,559
Come on.

964
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,599
Little Su.

965
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,880
I'll sleep with you tonight.

966
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,159
Hold on.

967
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
Let's go over the script again.

968
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,079
Last night,

969
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,199
we didn't stay out all night.

970
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
When we came back,

971
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,599
she'd already slept.

972
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,559
In addition,

973
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,320
you mustn't tell Mom

974
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,400
I can't tell you.

975
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,719
You can't tell her

976
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,599
you can't let mom know

977
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:57,760
aunt Hua.

978
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Mother.

979
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,840
It's true.

980
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,559
Actually, last night...

981
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,239
You both never stayed out all night, right?

982
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,320
Right?

983
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,719
Continue the act.

984
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,199
Continue with the story.

985
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,599
Act!

986
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,840
Sister-in-law, help me!

987
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,320
Aunt Hua,

988
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,519
actually, last night...

989
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,679
You don't have to explain.

990
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,719
Ms. Hua knows that

991
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,679
In any case

992
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,039
they must have forced you to do it.

993
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,679
You forced them to do it.

994
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,239
What are you mumbling?

995
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:26,760
Mu Huron.

996
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,599
It's nothing, mom.

997
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Let's talk about it later.

998
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,599
Alright.

999
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:30,599
Mu Xiaoman,

1000
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,519
tell me the truth.

1001
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,559
What exactly happened?

1002
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,840
I'll count to three.

1003
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,079
Three.

1004
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:37,639
Two...

1005
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,800
Mom, I said that

1006
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,159
actually,

1007
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,679
It's not a big deal.

1008
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,119
Leng, I'm sorry.

1009
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,480
Last night

1010
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,000
my brother didn't come home on purpose.

1011
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,199
And you run away again,

1012
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,039
for everything.

1013
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,000
Come on.

1014
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,400
Both of you...

1015
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,440
Be honest with me.

1016
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,079
Why didn't you come home last night?

1017
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,800
What exactly happened to Xiaoman?

1018
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,039
Okay, I'll be honest.

1019
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,599
Last night, actually,

1020
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,440
hey, Huron.

1021
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
Last night,

1022
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,239
I went to an activity.

1023
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,079
And then Xiaoman

1024
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,119
she went with me.

1025
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,519
Huron is worried about her.

1026
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,719
That's why he followed us.

1027
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,519
Right, honey?

1028
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,199
After that, we got drunk.

1029
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,039
And stayed at the hotel.

1030
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,800
Since you both stayed at the hotel,

1031
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:34,920
xiao Jin,

1032
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,159
you young people are busy with work.

1033
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,679
I understand that.

1034
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,239
But no matter how busy you are,

1035
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,599
It needs to be vigorous

1036
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,199
seize the time of youth,

1037
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:45,760
mom, I...

1038
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
It's you!

1039
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,119
You men really

1040
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,119
have to recognize the reality.

1041
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,000
Come on, Xiao Jin.

1042
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,079
Leave him alone.

1043
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,400
Have one more.

1044
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,480
Thank you.

1045
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
See that?

1046
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,039
Let me change the scene.

1047
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,400
Look at this perfect couple. What a perfect match.

1048
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,599
What a perfect match.

1049
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,480
Who am I? Where am I.

1050
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,519
Why should I do this?

1051
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,880
That's annoying.

1052
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,360
You can be more comfortable if you lean on it.

1053
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,159
Don't misunderstand.

1054
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
I don't want you to move around

1055
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,719
to disturb my reading.

1056
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,039
My mom, she's...

1057
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,400
She's all obsessed with showing off her daughters-in-law.

1058
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,280
Do you believe that

1059
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,079
she will definitely

1060
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,159
and her best friends

1061
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,400
her live-streaming

1062
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,599
showing off their love.

1063
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,519
Here you are.

1064
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,360
I specially bought you a new cake.

1065
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,320
Try it.

1066
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,480
By the way,

1067
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
did my sister-in-law suffer?

1068
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,599
But I remember that you said

1069
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,599
that you didn't like Su Jin?

1070
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,840
That was the past.

1071
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,400
The Mu Xiaoman of today

1072
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,199
Is no longer the Mu Xiaoman

1073
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:13,880
who she was yesterday.

1074
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,639
I like her very much now.

1075
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,880
I want her to be my sister-in-law.

1076
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:18,480
I can't.

1077
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,320
I have to get her out now!

1078
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,159
But I can't let my brother get away with it.

1079
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,400
Come on.

1080
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,360
Since you gave up

1081
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,039
from him today,

1082
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,119
I will get something from him for you.

1083
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,320
Xiaoman asked me to go to the archery museum.

1084
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,119
Bye.

1085
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,679
I'm not going.

1086
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,239
Alright.

1087
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,440
You can stay here with my mom

1088
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,639
and act in it.

1089
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,280
I thought you wouldn't go?

1090
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,280
Who said that?

1091
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,840
It's a rare holiday. Of course it's Huron.

1092
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,519
I'll go wherever you go.

1093
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,760
Aunt Hua.

1094
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,519
Huron is going out for a while.

1095
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,519
And I'll accompany him.

1096
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:11,920
Alright.

1097
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,480
Go on.

1098
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,760
Let's go, honey. Go change.

1099
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,719
I'll leave first.

1100
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,199
Let's go to change clothes.

1101
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
They are having a date.

1102
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
And went out to play.

1103
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,760
Watch Your Step/Mind the Step

1104
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,840
finally, we don't need to act.

1105
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,440
Come on.

1106
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,079
Or your mom comes out again.

1107
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:48,880
Match?

1108
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,239
Go against Gao Ling.

1109
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,519
What if you win?

1110
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,119
I'll forgive you.

1111
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,519
Interfere in my freedom.

1112
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,840
What if you lose?

1113
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,559
Promise Gao Ling one thing.

1114
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,639
Gao Ling, tell him your demand.

1115
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,079
I want to take a leave.

1116
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,880
Not right.

1117
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,480
I want a raise.

1118
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,320
That's not right either.

1119
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,159
I can't afford to be rich and not have time.

1120
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,280
I'd better take a vacation.

1121
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,280
I haven't agreed to compete with you.

1122
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,039
If it's not challenging,

1123
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:14,960
that won't be challenging.

1124
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,880
Brother.

1125
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,480
Xiaoman,

1126
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:18,800
look at your brother's

1127
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,920
from head to toe.

1128
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,320
Don't look down on me.

1129
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,840
Since Brother said that,

1130
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,079
let's compete.

1131
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,480
No. Compare.

1132
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,280
Shall we compete?

1133
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,480
Kaolin archery

1134
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,880
very good archery.

1135
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:33,679
Mr. Mu,

1136
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,280
you aren't afraid to lose, are you?
