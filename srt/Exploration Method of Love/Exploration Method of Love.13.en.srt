1
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,879
The kiss you gave

2
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,000
In front of reporters.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,760
It was very good.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
Can you recreate that

5
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,840
that's too fake.

6
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,959
The effect is not good.

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,519
Director, I think

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,199
oK. OK. Great.

9
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,919
Hold on.

10
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,759
Good, very good.

11
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,479
Good. Perfect.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,560
Time to knock off.

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,199
Thank you, mentors.

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Come on.

15
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
You're not against me either.

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,280
Work needs the director's requirements.

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,080
Right?

18
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,560
Mr. Li,

19
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,639
I've contacted

20
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,639
the planning department.

21
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,960
They will send you

22
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,719
the proposal later.

23
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay, Mr. Ma.

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Hold on.

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm sending the file to you.

26
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Okay, copy that, Mr. Li.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,039
I'll pass the message

28
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,919
Inform Mr. Mu.

29
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Where should I go?

30
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,319
We can't.

31
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm sure Gao Ling hasn't eaten yet.

32
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,319
I can't leave like this.

33
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,240
Why are you here?

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,079
Brother Gao Ling.

35
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,759
Take shelter from the rain at my house.

36
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,800
Why are you here?

37
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm waiting for you.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,439
But I thought you'd be exhausted

39
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,720
that's why I didn't bother you.

40
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
It's pouring with rain.

41
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,439
Don't you know to take shelter?

42
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,759
It's alright.

43
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,199
Just a little bit.

44
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,560
My makeup is not ruined, right?

45
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,120
I think you will get sick again.

46
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,240
To be happy.

47
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,839
They won't.

48
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,680
Sickness won't do anything to you.

49
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,879
This is for you.

50
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,079
Look who's talking.

51
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,079
You can't eat nothing

52
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,160
when you work,

53
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
not eating all the time?

54
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,839
I'll get stomach illness sooner or later.

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,160
Thank you.

56
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,639
You're welcome.

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
Open it and have a look.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
This time,

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,839
when I wrote it.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,480
I guarantee no matter what website you visit,

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,279
will find no similarity.

62
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,600
Do you look forward to

63
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,120
when I first read it?

64
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,759
Hurry to read it!

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,639
Xiaoman.

66
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,160
Thank you.

67
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,720
But sorry,

68
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,600
I've spent the whole day writing.

69
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,639
You didn't even take a look.

70
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Sorry.

71
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,759
Xiaoman.

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,319
Go to my house to shelter from the rain.

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,319
The rain has stopped. I'll send you back.

74
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Come in.

75
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,680
Come on.

76
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,879
Stop smelling it.

77
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,040
No one

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
no one else has been here.

79
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,720
My nose is stuffed up

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
because of the rain.

81
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,079
I'll get you a towel.

82
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,079
Take a hot shower, or you'll catch a cold.

83
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,399
I forgot my laundry.

84
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,959
I saw you in the bathroom

85
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,399
only your white shirt

86
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,439
so I put it on first.

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
You haven't had dinner, have you?

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,040
I'll go cook some noodles for you.

89
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,320
What?

90
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,519
What?

91
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,679
You haven't eaten anything for a whole day.

92
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,000
How can you drink ice on an empty stomach?

93
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,759
Soup on an empty stomach?

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
So he ate with

95
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,279
with the boy you like

96
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,039
to be a kid.

97
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,879
What's wrong with you? You're an adult.

98
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,320
Yet you coughed to drink water.

99
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,279
I'm full.

100
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,399
I'm full.

101
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,919
I have no appetite.

102
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,879
What do you know?

103
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
When it comes to

104
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,720
before their favorite boys,

105
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
has a small appetite.

106
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,799
Miss Su, thank you.

107
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,559
I look forward to the next recording.

108
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,360
Miss Su, here's to you.

109
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,639
This recording is very pleasant.

110
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,360
I look forward to

111
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,519
when I see you next time.

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,720
I hope

113
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,320
come on. Thank you.

114
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,360
Thank you, Mr. Mu, for your support.

115
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
We hope that the last few recordings

116
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,120
can go smoothly.

117
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,679
Alright.

118
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,399
Thank you for your hard work.

119
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:42,679
Thank you.

120
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,039
Take your time.

121
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,639
Another one.

122
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,600
Good cooperation.

123
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,039
Huron.

124
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,559
I might have to leave later.

125
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,159
Can I have

126
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,279
speak with you alone?

127
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,480
Alright.

128
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
Come on.

129
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,279
Miss Su.

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
Another toast to you.

131
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,840
Come on.

132
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,720
Come on. Thank you.

133
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,799
Sorry.

134
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,360
It seems I drank too much.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm going back to have a rest.

136
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
Enjoy yourselves.

137
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
Stay with them.

138
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,440
Bye, Sis.

139
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,919
Have a seat.

140
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,000
Huron.

141
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,679
You know I've always liked you

142
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,720
since the university,

143
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
It's been so many years.

144
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
When I see you again,

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
and I still want to be with you.

146
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,039
But I already have someone

147
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,960
someone I already like.

148
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,039
I know that.

149
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,240
But aren't you

150
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,159
to marry, right?

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,120
That's fine.

152
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,799
I can wait for you.

153
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,480
It's really not necessary.

154
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,720
Please excuse me.

155
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,080
Su Jishi, what's wrong with you?

156
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Please come around.

157
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,639
He's the one Jing Qing likes.

158
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,159
Why would you eavesdrop?

159
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,000
I learned to set up tents with him.

160
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,000
He sings my songs.

161
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
Every second I'm with him

162
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,000
will be as dazzling and unforgettable.

163
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,480
What brings you here?

164
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,279
Chen Shiyi and I

165
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,919
are just former schoolmates.

166
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't think too much.

167
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,240
You don't have to tell me that.

168
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,279
For the whole day.

169
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
You were not avoiding me on purpose.

170
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,799
You are against me.

171
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,919
Or they suddenly

172
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,679
read out the agreement

173
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,799
you want to draw a line between us?

174
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,519
Everything was fine before I got here.

175
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,320
Why?

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,120
Nothing.

177
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,279
I admit that

178
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,559
our relationship

179
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,080
really started

180
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
with an agreement.

181
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
I just hoped that

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,480
I could use this agreement

183
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,080
to keep my life balanced.

184
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,519
But I didn't expect that

185
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,919
I lost control

186
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,039
because of the agreement.

187
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,960
I began to worry and miss you

188
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
and miss you.

189
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,679
I would even see your face

190
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,879
In my mind every day.

191
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,440
Until recently, I realized...

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
In my life.

193
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,919
I want to be with you when I'm really with you.

194
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Sister, look!

195
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,159
Shooting star.

196
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,919
We finally saw a shooting star.

197
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,039
We wish upon a shooting star.

198
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
May our wishes

199
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,200
will succeed.

200
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,039
I know.

201
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm not mature enough

202
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,519
mature enough for a relationship.

203
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,799
But could you wait for me?

204
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,279
Trust me more?

205
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,240
Mr. Mu.

206
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,279
To be clear.

207
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,200
I hope that we can keep our relationship

208
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,519
and our relationship is simple.

209
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,200
Why?

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I renewed your contract

211
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
so that I can

212
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,360
to earn more money.

213
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,480
Don't get too carried away, okay?

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,399
I don't believe it.

215
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
Go to bed early.

216
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
Alright, I'll send you home.

217
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,759
Brother Gao Ling, my heart beats so fast.

218
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,519
I seem to like you a little.

219
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,879
This is the first love letter

220
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,120
I wrote in my life.

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,679
You must read it carefully.

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,919
You can't only eat

223
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,919
when you work,

224
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,120
that you often skip meals?

225
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,399
This time,

226
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,639
when I wrote it.

227
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,000
I guarantee no matter what website you visit,

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,399
no website you search on.

229
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,039
Gao Ling, I'll say it one more time.

230
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm really in love with you.

231
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,600
If I have tried my best

232
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,279
I don't make you like me,

233
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,039
that's my own business.

234
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,159
It's none of your business.

235
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,759
Then the one you love

236
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,000
you can't fly anywhere.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,960
Don't worry.

238
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,240
But before this,

239
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,679
I won't take back

240
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,159
a tiny bit of affection for you.

241
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
Take the medicine.

242
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,559
What medicine?

243
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,879
I bought you stomach medicine.

244
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,840
Tonight,

245
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,320
I saw you had a stomachache the whole night.

246
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,200
Let me take it for you.

247
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,039
I just timed it.

248
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,159
To take the medicines.

249
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,639
Hold on.

250
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Take the medicine.

251
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,279
You need to feed your stomach.

252
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,360
In the future,

253
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,559
urge you to eat.

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,080
Thanks.

255
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,599
Brother Gao Ling.

256
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,039
Are my clothes dry?

257
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,960
It seems to be raining heavily outside.

258
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,119
I'll take a taxi myself.

259
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,039
Don't see me off.

260
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,960
Have an early rest

261
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,440
It's pouring outside.

262
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
There's nothing that fits you.

263
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,519
How about you sleep here tonight?

264
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,039
I'm worried about you.

265
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,039
You're late by yourself.

266
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,920
Wearing this to your house...

267
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
I knew you'd worry.

268
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,960
Where's my bedroom?

269
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,079
And accidentally captured the fortress.

270
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,359
Smell of Gaoling.

271
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,359
Xiaoman, have you slept?

272
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Why did he leave?

273
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,079
Right.

274
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,640
Don't take advantage of others.

275
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,519
Is the kind of spiritual brother I like.

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
There is coffee on the table in the dining room.

277
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,240
There's toast in the toaster.

278
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Eat it and go to work.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,279
Hello, Fang Xie.

280
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,440
Don't you have any orders?

281
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,359
I've been free for almost a week.

282
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,400
And the love affair

283
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
that romantic relationship...

284
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,759
Other than that,

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,559
I think so.

286
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
See you later.

287
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,240
Dear Baby.

288
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,599
You're as beautiful as the stars

289
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,079
as the stars in the sky.

290
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,440
Go to sleep.

291
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,039
Are they crazy?

292
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,799
It's just a man.

293
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,400
Stop singing in my head.

294
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,119
♫ Dream is a locked door ♫

295
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,519
♪ Everyone's trying to ask why ♪

296
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,480
But if I want to keep fame and fortune everlasting

297
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,160
my control of the key

298
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,240
the control of the key

299
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,880
If you want to hold on to success,

300
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,279
but I lose some luck.

301
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,599
Those inexplicable

302
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,720
of love

303
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,200
when you're in love.

304
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,680
What's going on?

305
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,960
Wu Danxia was talking to her.

306
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,480
Fang, what did you say just now?

307
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,319
I didn't hear you.

308
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Let me ask you this.

309
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,480
I will let you

310
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,759
with Little Su alone.

311
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,960
Why is she like this?

312
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,319
I have no idea.

313
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
He was fine for the first day.

314
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,440
We just argued.

315
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,519
She had a positive attitude.

316
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,240
She was acting strange the next day.

317
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,799
By the way, they even

318
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,599
to change the locker room.

319
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,039
Lower your voice.

320
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,240
You sing very well, sis.

321
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,440
For two days and one night.

322
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,359
And loses her temper when she wakes up.

323
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,480
The next day...

324
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,720
I feel dizzy.

325
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,039
Mr. Mu is not trying to

326
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,599
overlord and overlord?

327
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,559
Miss Su.

328
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,160
Is Mr. Mu bullying you?

329
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Little Su.

330
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,359
As much as I love you guys,

331
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,119
but if Mr. Mu bullies you,

332
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,119
I, Wu Danxia,

333
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,400
to oppose me.

334
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,519
And won't let him off the hook.

335
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,279
Enough. Stop imagining things.

336
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,680
How can you insist on attacking them?

337
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,039
It should be me who should attack them.

338
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,079
What the hell is that?

339
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,880
You're worse than me when you drink.

340
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,839
What a night in Shanghai!

341
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,759
Night Shanghai?

342
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,039
You are the city that never sleeps.

343
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,599
Mr. Mu.

344
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,440
I hope that

345
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
our cooperative relationship only.

346
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,920
Why?

347
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,319
Because I renewed your contract.

348
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,759
I'm only doing this to make more money.

349
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,960
Don't get too into character, okay?

350
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,200
The way you drink it,

351
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,839
I should prepare

352
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,680
Insulin, right?

353
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,799
What's the situation today?

354
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,079
What's wrong with both of you?

355
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,839
You can't keep doing this.

356
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,319
If there are any problems,

357
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,240
you have to solve them.

358
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,640
Answer my question.

359
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,079
Yes, Mr. Mu.

360
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,319
Are you asking about Miss Su's schedule?

361
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,839
I don't know.

362
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:54,960
To rebel.

363
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,160
If you care about her so much,

364
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,759
you should go to her instead.

365
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,359
How many days has it been since the show came back?

366
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,319
Is it useful

367
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,319
Is it useful to beat around the bush?

368
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,079
Does she know?

369
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,640
Will she make up with you?

370
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
I've told you all I could.

371
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,079
How can I ask her again?

372
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,079
You are trying to save face and make yourself suffer like this?

373
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,519
Think it through.

374
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,200
To save face or to win him over?

375
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:16,839
I...

376
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,839
In short,

377
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,000
I'll go on strike from now on.

378
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,160
I have no comment on Miss Su's schedule.

379
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,480
Huron, love is not a business.

380
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,559
You can't just let others do it for you.

381
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,319
Mr. Mu,

382
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,720
miss Su is drinking with us.

383
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,839
She's probably drunk.

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,839
Hurry and get up.

385
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,400
Hurry and get up.

386
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,440
Where's Little Su?

387
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,160
I've paid the bill. I'll go home.

388
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,000
When you're sober, go home on your own.

389
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,960
Be careful, everyone.

390
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,559
Where is the takeout?

391
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,759
Little Su.

392
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
Why are you here?

393
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,599
I called you

394
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,240
but you didn't answer.

395
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,279
So you came here directly.

396
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,240
Little Su.

397
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,839
I'm here to tell you

398
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
to tell you that I liked you before.

399
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

400
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,960
I think I like you more now.

401
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
What are you talking about?

402
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
I'm serious.

403
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,200
I know

404
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,200
that you don't like Mu Hurun at all.

405
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,799
Let's try together.

406
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,119
Alright?

407
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,480
Stop the nonsense.

408
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,960
Please promise me this once.

409
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Back off.

410
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,200
Get out of the way. Get off.

411
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,440
Get off.

412
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
Please stay away from her.

413
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,039
Are you still acting without cameras?

414
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,519
Muhuron.

415
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,640
I heard everything that day.

416
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,920
You and Little Su

417
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,119
just a partnership.

418
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
I admit that

419
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,039
our relationship

420
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:30,839
really started

421
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,200
with an agreement.

422
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,640
I just hoped that

423
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,559
I could use this agreement

424
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,200
to keep my life balanced.

425
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,519
Since you are not

426
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,319
are not a real couple,

427
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,960
I'm qualified to chase her then.

428
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,279
Without her consent,

429
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,759
without the consent of the person concerned,

430
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,880
and got fresh with her.

431
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,000
Based on what you did just now,

432
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,359
Is already causing the harassment.

433
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,119
Do you need the police to come

434
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,039
show you

435
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:52,839
about the law?

436
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,759
I won't be scared by you.

437
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,279
After she wakes up,

438
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,720
and let her decide.

439
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
It's you again?

440
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:06,880
I know.

441
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,759
That you are here to steal mines.

442
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,640
I caught you.

443
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,160
Turn into this again.

444
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,880
Your ears are so red.

445
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,279
It looks like sunset red landscape rocks.

446
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
It's so red.

447
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,440
Give me the hammer.

448
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,359
Stand firm.

449
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,000
Welcome home.

450
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,960
It's so hot in the mountain.

451
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,519
Wait for me to change into my hiking suit.

452
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,839
In the name of the moon, punish you.

453
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,680
Don't take it off.

454
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I wanted to talk to you.

455
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,160
But now I'm so drunk.

456
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,400
Su Dianqing's notebook

457
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,400
she has been acting abnormal recently.

458
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
Is it related to her sister?

459
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
Mu Hurun, come here.

460
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,480
Mu Huron.

461
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,759
Don't be naughty.

462
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,000
You're a stingy guy.

463
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,000
A narcissist.

464
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,240
Jealous?

465
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Don't be so nice to me.

466
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,519
I will be out of control

467
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,880
I am going to lose control.

468
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,240
What a mean person!

469
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,519
So jealous.

470
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,319
Su Jishi told you not to drink,

471
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,039
but you insisted on drinking.

472
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,759
Don't you know alcohol is evil?

473
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,440
You're awake.

474
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,079
I lost my memories.

475
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,880
And don't remember anything.

476
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,519
Right.

477
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Come and have breakfast.

478
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,559
I'll help you.

479
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,079
Is he serious?

480
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,599
Whatever. You are someone who has amnesia.

481
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,799
It's a little cold.

482
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,039
I'll heat it up for you.

483
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
What are you doing?

484
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm making breakfast.

485
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:12,799
Why?

486
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,839
What?

487
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,960
Given our relationship,

488
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,440
Isn't it normal

489
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,680
Isn't that normal?

490
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,759
Our relationship now

491
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,799
hello? Miss Su?

492
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,200
She should be awake now.

493
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,599
Then get up now.

494
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,519
And tidy things up.

495
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,559
We have work to do.

496
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,119
For the Fancy Trip later,

497
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,279
are going to raid the recording.

498
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:42,960
Where's Gao Ling?

499
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,119
I've informed Mr. Mu.

500
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,480
He should be on the way.

501
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,599
Yes, I'm here.

502
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,400
Why do I seem to hear

503
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,279
hear Mr. Mu's voice?

504
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:50,920
Right.

505
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,160
He came to place some things there.

506
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,880
Okay, I have to go.

507
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,039
I'm going to get ready.

508
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,319
Hey.

509
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,799
Gao Ling said the media...

510
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,799
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

511
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,039
Come and help me.

512
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,440
I think it's better to make things clear.

513
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,119
I think

514
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,880
before the staff comes,

515
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,519
I need to make one thing clear

516
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,599
make one thing clear to you.

517
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,880
What else is there to talk about?

518
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,079
It was obvious last night.

519
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,519
Now we are

520
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,880
are now my girlfriend.

521
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,599
Last night, in the catalysis of alcohol,

522
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,720
my behavior last night

523
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,079
are completely out of my control.

524
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,039
So, I can't be responsible

525
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,480
for my actions yesterday.

526
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:06,799
What does that mean?

527
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,360
It means

528
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
we are both adults.

529
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,760
Your actions last night didn't mean anything.

530
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,960
Thank you, Miss Su and Mr. Mu.

531
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Thank you for your hard work today.

532
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,719
I'll leave now.

533
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,199
Pay your respects.

534
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,039
Bye-bye. Bye.

535
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,719
Mu Huron, don't be so angry.

536
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,199
Why were you acting so strange just now?

537
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,320
Is it strange?

538
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,440
Let go of me.

539
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,920
You can even turn your back on me.

540
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,800
Why can't I be so weird?

541
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
I just slept for a while, didn't I?

542
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,239
What's up

543
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,400
It's just...

544
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,559
Remember to close the door when you leave.

545
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,000
We have one hour to get off work.

546
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,440
Let's touch the fish.

547
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:46,920
What happened?

548
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,000
Who bullied you?

549
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,920
That was a touching story.

550
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,239
What's it about?

551
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,719
The answer is

552
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,039
with her first boyfriend

553
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:57,960
with her first boyfriend,

554
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,559
and they're very good.

555
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,960
But one day,

556
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,719
she found out she was sick.

557
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
Considering her boyfriend's character,

558
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,800
he'll be by her side.

559
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,519
But she didn't want to

560
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,719
get in the way of his future.

561
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,159
Then she hid herself.

562
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,400
Not to let him find her.

563
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,840
She is now

564
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,400
she is working very hard to treat.

565
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,880
And on this,

566
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,599
about the time

567
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,519
sweet moments

568
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,599
and sweet moments

569
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,440
but the sweeter it is,

570
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,199
the worse the ending is.

571
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
If the boy

572
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,400
she's ill,

573
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
and she needed

574
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,599
by her side,

575
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,760
and keep her company.

576
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,639
That will be good.

577
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,679
Are you sure it's not from a hand writer?

578
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,280
Bummer!

579
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,239
Life is so hard.

580
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:39,920
And aren't you allowed

581
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,599
there's some true love in this world.

582
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,440
You're too simple.

583
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,400
Don't believe her.

584
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,159
I'll leave you to your work.

585
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,320
I can't.

586
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,800
I need to contact the blogger herself.

587
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,920
Listen to her.

588
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,239
Hello, Miss.

589
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,480
I want to make friends with you.

590
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,599
OK?

591
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,360
Isn't this the direction of the hotel?

592
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,719
Where is he going?

593
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,800
I've already seen you when I'm there.

594
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,519
Turn around.

595
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,440
Hello

596
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,639
alright.

597
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,199
There's a new girl coming.

598
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,920
You're trying to annoy me again, aren't you?

599
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,360
I won't fall for this time.

600
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,119
I think you really like

601
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,119
you should really like it.

602
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,079
Be careful

603
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,920
stupid jerk.

604
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,440
I hate you!

605
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,920
Your disappointed eyes.

606
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,239
You thought it was Mr. Mu?

607
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,079
When the program group raided it,

608
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:34,360
you didn't come.

609
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,199
Why are you here now?

610
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,840
President Chen asked me for something.

611
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,760
How is the recording?

612
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,079
Come in.

613
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,519
After hearing what you said,

614
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,679
mr. Mu is indeed the person

615
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,119
the one Jinqing likes.

616
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,159
That song has never been published,

617
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,559
and I didn't even know it.

618
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,079
She knows how to write lyrics.

619
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:57,880
That's why...

620
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,719
I don't know how to face it either.

621
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,639
My goodness.

622
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,280
Are you in love with Mr. Mu?

623
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,440
But because of his sister,

624
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,039
to face such feelings,

625
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,639
all right, eat less.

626
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,199
We have to shoot the commercial tomorrow.

627
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,480
What commercial?

628
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,039
The chocolate brand

629
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,960
the chocolate brand.

630
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,280
I heard that

631
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,159
has a good recording.

632
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,519
They proposed the advertising plan overnight.

633
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,480
We'll shoot tomorrow.

634
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
Will it be

635
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,599
see Mu Xiuren again?

636
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:32,760
Don't worry.

637
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,840
And Qin Qiu too.

638
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Finished, disasters never come singly.

639
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,079
There's only one character in it.

640
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,800
Then...

641
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,400
These two men are playing chocolate?

642
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:51,800
That's right.

643
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,519
We want to

644
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,800
want to express

645
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,559
to show

646
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,400
the way we performed

647
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,280
the way of acting

648
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,679
the actions are mainly followed by the lines.

649
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,199
Instructors, familiarize yourself

650
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,519
It's okay. We can start now.

651
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,000
Alright.

652
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,400
Let's try the part of pure love first.

653
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,760
Mr. Su and Mr. Qin

654
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,840
were originally a couple

655
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,000
and college sweetheart.

656
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,400
Lovers.

657
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,920
You think I'm invisible?

658
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,559
Let's have a try first.

659
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,039
Come on, director.

660
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,360
Director, please rehearse first.

661
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,320
We want more interaction in rehearsal.

662
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,079
Little Su.

663
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,239
Get closer to me.

664
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,039
Stay so close.

665
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,840
Aren't you afraid of the hiccups?

666
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:38,920
That...

667
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,519
Why don't we try that

668
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,239
three people swimming...

669
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,400
This three-person tour...

670
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,039
The thing is,

671
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,880
dark Qiao and the heroine

672
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,639
were originally together.

673
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,159
Hazelnut wanted to steal the heroine.

674
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,400
Dark Qiao protected her.

675
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,840
Unexpectedly, Hazel

676
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,199
so pitiful.

677
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,519
The heroine feels distressed.

678
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,559
Let Hazel join in.

679
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,840
It's a three-person game.

680
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
When the three mentors are ready,

681
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,280
let's start now.

682
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
Three, two, one, go.

683
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,039
Little Jin.

684
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:24,440
The move seems to be

685
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,519
to be like this.

686
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,639
Mu Hurun, you made the wrong moves.

687
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,519
What are you doing?

688
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:28,960
Can't I

689
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,039
a little bit of freedom?

690
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,119
The script is good.

691
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,760
What are you using?

692
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,159
What...

693
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,199
Stop bothering me.

694
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,239
No, that's not it.

695
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,480
Miss Su.

696
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,679
We might as well follow Mr. Mu's move

697
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,800
and Mr. Mu's move.

698
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,199
It might be more promising.

699
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
The director is right.

700
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,199
Director, let's

701
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,119
adjust our condition.

702
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,800
Alright.

703
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,840
All three of you should take a break.

704
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,559
Have some water.

705
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,000
Please.

706
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,559
What are you doing?

707
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,800
Is being hard on others.

708
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,119
I wasn't giving him a hard time.

709
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,480
As for you,

710
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,119
you shouldn't have

711
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,079
you can be so free with him,

712
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,559
but why not me?

713
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,320
Why can't I?

714
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,360
How do you want me to cooperate?

715
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
Sweet and warm.

716
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,639
We are just in a cooperative relationship.

717
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,239
There are no real feelings.

718
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,480
I don't care what I do.
