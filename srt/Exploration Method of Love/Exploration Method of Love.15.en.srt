1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,879
All our actions

2
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,400
Is limited by the rules.

3
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,760
You know

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,400
that I was

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
a very unruly person.

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,480
You have to get up on time in the morning

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,640
go to bed on time at night.

8
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,920
People line up when they eat.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,359
Even to line up for meals.

10
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,280
I once thought

11
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,359
I wouldn't have to spend my life

12
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,760
by these rules?

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
Until Director Zhou came,

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,199
he broke the rules.

15
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,159
And taught us to play games.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,719
Like the one we played that day.

17
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,840
Chicken vs Eagle

18
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,439
every class

19
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,919
Is only 40 minutes long.

20
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,840
He will announce it

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,919
tell him everything

22
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,080
about everything

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
about the class.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,879
After the class,

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
to tell us a fairy tale.

26
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,159
Slowly,

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
I suddenly feel that

28
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,560
that it's okay to

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,960
It's OK.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
Happy, even.

31
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,479
Until one day,

32
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,639
director Zhou went out with me.

33
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,000
Picking up rocks

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
picking up stones,

35
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,120
and fell off the mountain.

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,919
The Aunty Sun

37
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,560
In the hospital today

38
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,879
was his wife.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,680
At that time,

40
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,719
I was pregnant,

41
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,840
It's all your fault.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
He died because of you!

43
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,240
He hasn't even seen

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,520
his own child.

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,159
I didn't even apologize to you.

46
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,080
It's not that I don't want to.

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,080
I really dare not.

48
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm afraid that she'd

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
she wouldn't accept my apology.

50
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,479
I'm also afraid.

51
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,000
I was afraid to face it.

52
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm more afraid that

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
she doesn't accept

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,879
what I did to Sun Village.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
And hearing that,

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,439
these things?

57
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,960
Huron.

58
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,840
I think Head Zhou

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,319
to support and protect

60
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,639
the kids' dreams

61
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,759
must be his Xiaguang and Milky Way.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,879
He wouldn't want you to be trapped

63
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,479
In the shadow of your past.

64
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,399
So,

65
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,680
you also need to live a good life.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,319
And live as free and happy

67
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,680
that he wants.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,279
So that I won't fail

69
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,839
be unworthy of all that Head Zhou has done.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,439
Right?

71
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,519
Lun, you have to remember that

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,920
dream is your best friend.

73
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,720
Let's go and eat something.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,480
Alright.

75
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,720
Eat.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,360
High altitude.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,199
Let's eat together.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,319
I'm not going.

79
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,279
You enjoy the food.

80
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,319
Let's go together, Secretary Gao.

81
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,879
It's been a while

82
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,800
since we last had a gathering.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,759
Alright?

84
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,920
Invite everyone.

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,759
My treat.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,240
Meili, it's on Secretary Gao.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,439
Who will go?

88
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,399
I'll go then.

89
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,920
I'll go with you.

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,560
Me too.

91
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,519
It's good that you are so active at work.

92
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,720
Xiaoman, let's go together.

93
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm not going. You guys go first.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
It's rare for Secretary Gao to invite you.

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,199
Don't miss it.

96
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,319
Well, I suddenly remembered that

97
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,199
I ordered takeout food.

98
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,319
It can't be wasted, right?

99
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,639
Go on without me.

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,079
Then let's go.

101
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,319
We are leaving then.

102
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,079
We are leaving.

103
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,560
See you later.

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,079
Pay your respects.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,600
Bye-bye.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
Bad high school.

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
This is the girl

108
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,399
with her ex-boyfriend Gao Shan?

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,319
Their love story was so sweet

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,800
It might help to ask her.

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Xia Tian, I also have someone

112
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
I also like very much.

113
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,360
He keeps turning me down.

114
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
If you don't mind,

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,079
can you listen to my story?

116
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,040
Analyse it for me?

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,959
Why don't they use a washing machine?

118
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,879
Except the oil stain

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
besides the oil stain,

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,800
other than the oil stains.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,360
If we don't clean this,

122
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,079
the washing machine won't wash it either.

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Why are you here?

124
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
I just came here

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
to send some things to the kids.

126
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,079
You didn't do this.

127
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,399
Don't worry, Aunty Sun.

128
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,199
My clothes are clean now.

129
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,759
On my way here,

130
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,639
le Le told me that

131
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,360
fatty drew the map again last night.

132
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,720
Fatty,

133
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
as long as we are happy during the day,

134
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,600
and draw a map at night.

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
That's my fault.

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,199
I made them crazy that day.

137
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
It was my fault that

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
It's my fault.

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not your fault.

140
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,040
Chubby.

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
He's naughtier than other kids.

142
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,519
He is like a little monkey all the day.

143
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,959
Jumping around all day.

144
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,399
Dancing around.

145
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,959
It's still due to me.

146
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,040
It's still my fault.

147
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,720
Come and rest.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
It's dry recently.

149
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
The children love to cough.

150
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,480
This is snow pear soup from the kitchen.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,519
Try it if you don't mind.

152
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,120
Thank you, Aunt Sun.

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,799
You must be tired.

154
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,679
I'm still strong.

155
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,480
I'm not tired at all.

156
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,440
Is it good?

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,440
I heard that you

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,559
to work here recently, right?

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,559
Yes, I just retired.

160
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,080
The kids went to college.

161
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,279
I'm also kind of free now.

162
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,799
And here

163
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,559
to do something within my power.

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
You're so great.

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,879
Why are you so great?

166
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,200
It's just to show his sincerity.

167
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,720
Besides,

168
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,879
the soul of a child's father

169
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,200
when I looked at the children,

170
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,519
and I thought about

171
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,559
aunty Sun.

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
Actually,

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
I'm here to

174
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,840
to ask you a favor.

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
What is it?

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I want you to meet Huron.

177
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,440
All these years,

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,879
huron hasn't found a chance

179
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,960
to meet you.

180
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,639
So I just want to

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
please give him another chance.

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,879
Please give him another chance.

183
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,399
And apologize?

184
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,200
Then I said I forgive him.

185
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,759
That I don't blame him anymore.

186
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,320
I wanted him to relax

187
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,679
and live a good life.

188
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Do you think that there is

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,799
that is so generous?

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,639
Is such a trifle.

191
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,360
I didn't mean that.

192
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,559
You misunderstood.

193
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,799
Stop it!

194
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,759
I'm not going to see him.

195
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,159
I only apologized to

196
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,679
to put him at ease.

197
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,000
Can undo the past.

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,399
To bring the dead back to life?

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,159
If you ever plead for him again,

200
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,559
please leave here too.

201
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,559
Aunty Sun,

202
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,399
that was an accident.

203
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,679
A child shouldn't be

204
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,159
of all the consequences.

205
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,679
If Huron is just like you said,

206
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,440
he is just a person

207
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,879
to feel at ease.

208
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,080
He won't be bothered

209
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,320
by this problem for so many years.

210
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,159
He hasn't even

211
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,240
forget about Director Zhou.

212
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,519
Director Zhou's Welfare Center

213
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,159
that Director Zhou protects the most.

214
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,240
He has always tried his best

215
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,320
to care and protect

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,360
every child in Sun Village

217
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,879
If you don't believe it,

218
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,559
you can ask

219
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,720
other staff.

220
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,559
He's not

221
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,639
an ungrateful person.

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
I make this request today

223
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Is my own decision.

224
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,039
If I made you uncomfortable,

225
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,879
I apologize.

226
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,559
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,120
But I hope you will

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
about Huron.

229
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,399
I'm taking the liberty of showing up today.

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,639
I'll leave now, Aunty Sun.

231
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,879
Hold on.

232
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
Make the arrangement.

233
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,279
I can see him.

234
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,799
Thank you, Aunt Sun.

235
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,159
What should I do to make a man angry?

236
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
Miss Su said that we should

237
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
within today.

238
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,240
Who's mad at me? Mr. Mu?

239
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,919
Why?

240
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,200
Were you very angry?

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,399
Sister.

242
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,600
Don't ask so many questions.

243
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,120
Come on.

244
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
Come up with a solution now.

245
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Brother, I'll leave it to you, Xiao Xia.

246
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,879
You two should not

247
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,480
you shouldn't be asking me that.

248
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
You two are grown men.

249
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,519
Shouldn't you know

250
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,720
what men think?

251
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
For example,

252
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,480
when you're angry,

253
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,639
you should hope the one you like

254
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,799
how can I make you happy?

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
I have never

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,000
I never made my girlfriend angry.

257
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,200
When I had my girlfriend in college,

258
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,000
whenever I got angry,

259
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,799
she will be more angry than me.

260
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,759
I can only coax her at all times.

261
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,360
We haven't enjoyed that kind of happiness.

262
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,559
It seems that I need to do something about it.

263
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,080
Is that okay?

264
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,240
Trust me.

265
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,360
As long as Little Su

266
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
follow my plan.

267
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
No matter how tough a man is,

268
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,399
will give in.

269
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,240
What's wrong? You two don't believe me?

270
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,840
Totally.

271
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,600
Totally.

272
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,200
By "softhearted," I mean.

273
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,320
But why is Mr. Mu so angry?

274
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,639
He hasn't given birth yet.

275
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,120
Miss Su is afraid that he might give birth.

276
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
So he didn't want him to give birth.

277
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,840
Hello, Sir.

278
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,879
Ms. Su has made a reservation.

279
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,600
Room three.

280
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,399
Okay. This way, please.

281
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,000
Alright.

282
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,639
Hey.

283
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,279
Su.

284
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Miss Su, he's gone.

285
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,799
How do you feel now?

286
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,679
Look at her.

287
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,159
Can't see your face clearly?

288
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,399
No, not happy.

289
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,159
Got it.

290
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm on my way. Go back first.

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,679
Alright, sis.

292
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,639
It's late at night.

293
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,279
Cosplay at night?

294
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,840
What about your cosplay?

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,679
I'm fine with that.

296
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,639
But now,

297
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,759
restricting my freedom.

298
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,000
I can call the police.

299
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
I'd better call the police.

300
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,559
Grab the phone?

301
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,080
Oh, I'm screwed.

302
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,480
What are you doing?

303
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm...

304
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,039
I was worried that you'd be in a bad mood.

305
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,759
I was also worried about you.

306
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,240
I acted on my own.

307
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,799
To see me.

308
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,720
Are you a fool?

309
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,119
Thank you.

310
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,519
Aunty Sun.

311
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,119
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,119
Just an apology?

313
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,920
You don't have anything to say

314
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,119
to explain,

315
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,359
that's it?

316
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,359
Do you think I could forgive you?

317
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,359
I have nothing to explain.

318
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,039
I never expected

319
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
In the end.

320
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,519
How have you been these years?

321
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,160
Great.

322
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,839
My adoptive parents and my sister

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
all treated me well.

324
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Aren't you going to ask me

325
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,240
how I've been doing these years?

326
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
Aunty Sun.

327
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,640
Sorry.

328
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
Have a seat.

329
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,279
Sit down?

330
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
If you had told me

331
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
with all your excuses

332
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,240
and made excuses

333
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,759
begging for my forgiveness.

334
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,119
Or complain,

335
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,799
you've managed to

336
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
to live in these years.

337
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I'll never forgive you.

338
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,839
What you've done

339
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,519
for Sun Village.

340
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,960
That His Majesty did,

341
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,039
Including the orphanage.

342
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,119
From welfare centers.

343
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,519
The sympathy money

344
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,759
I also know that

345
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,160
actually,

346
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
you could have

347
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:20,880
and tell me

348
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
how much you paid.

349
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,920
Luckily, you didn't.

350
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,960
So I'd rather believe

351
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,079
to believe what Xiaojin said.

352
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,400
You did all these

353
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,240
Is not for peace of mind.

354
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,920
Zhou was right about you.

355
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,519
You lived up to his expectations.

356
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:40,720
So, if he

357
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,279
he would be very happy

358
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,400
he should be very happy.

359
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Alright, Aunty Sun is here for dinner.

360
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,279
This meal

361
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,839
just release the burden

362
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,839
and forget about it

363
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,960
live your life well.

364
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,720
You are a good girl.

365
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,119
It's because

366
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,279
for her sake.

367
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,400
To meet you.

368
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
You must be nice to her.

369
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,200
If I know

370
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,519
you treat her badly,

371
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,079
If you treat her badly.

372
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,519
Aunty Sun, she has forgiven me.

373
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,720
Really?

374
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,400
If it weren't for you,

375
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,200
I would never have the courage

376
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,759
face her for the rest of my life.

377
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,079
Mu Huron.

378
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,000
Let me take you to a place.

379
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,319
Still not here?

380
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,279
That's Xia.

381
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,960
If they still don't show up,

382
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,880
we might freeze to death.

383
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,200
Wait. Why do you treat Little Su?

384
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,160
That Little Su likes Mr. Mu.

385
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,200
That I like Mr. Mu.

386
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
What's so surprising about that?

387
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,279
I found out a long time ago

388
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,519
that Little Su likes Mr. Mu

389
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,920
Is just stubborn in her mouth

390
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
and refused to admit it.

391
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,359
Besides, I not only found that

392
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,640
that Little Su likes Mr. Mu,

393
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,839
I found out even earlier

394
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,640
that Mr. Mu is in love with Little Su.

395
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,680
They've been using double arrows for a long time.

396
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,799
I don't know...

397
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,799
About these?

398
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,880
That's the gap

399
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,839
between people.

400
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,400
You should have

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
be good at finding sweets.

402
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,200
Are they here?

403
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:39,839
Yes

404
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,200
that's right.

405
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,119
Remote control, get ready.

406
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,680
Okay, ready to fire!

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,599
Did someone propose here?

408
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,599
How outdated. He still spends like this.

409
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,000
This is the special gift

410
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
I was afraid you wouldn't be happy

411
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,920
you'd be unhappy after seeing her.

412
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,000
I knew that.

413
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,799
Seeing these flowers,

414
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,039
I feel very happy.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,039
I could tell from your face.

416
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,599
You must think it's cheap.

417
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:10,880
I've been running all day

418
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,599
I couldn't find anything.

419
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,759
I went to the wedding company

420
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,680
for these.

421
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,039
I think they're cheap too.

422
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,079
But there are cheaper ones.

423
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:16,960
Turn on the light.

424
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,359
Forget about it.

425
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,160
Today,

426
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,240
I have something to confess to you.

427
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you proposing?

428
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,839
I'm not joking with you!

429
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:39,640
Alright.

430
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,200
Before that,

431
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,400
you need to promise me a few conditions.

432
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,480
Alright.

433
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,000
I haven't even said the terms

434
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,759
yet you agree.

435
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,200
You can tell me any conditions, right?

436
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,400
After hearing that,

437
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,440
you may be angry.

438
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,160
But you can't ignore me.

439
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,119
You can't ignore me.

440
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,160
Or leave without saying goodbye.

441
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Can you do all these things?

442
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,000
Certainly.

443
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,119
I know

444
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,000
you hate when people cheat you.

445
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,839
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm not Su Jin.

447
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,559
That's Su Jishi.

448
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,200
I know you may think

449
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,319
to me.

450
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,000
That I was joking

451
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
that I was joking.

452
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:36,599
But Su Jin

453
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
Is my twin.

454
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,000
Due to some personal reasons,

455
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,039
she's away for a few months.

456
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,680
So I came here to take her place.

457
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,839
Oh!

458
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,319
It turns out

459
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,720
here is the thing.

460
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,920
Aren't you

461
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,759
not surprised at all?

462
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,599
Surprised?

463
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,039
What?

464
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,720
You are such a liar.

465
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,640
How dare you cheat me!

466
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,079
Sorry.

467
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,799
But acting is kind of...

468
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,119
Is a bit difficult.

469
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
When did you know?

470
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,680
When you were taking photos at the polo match,

471
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,720
so you knew it all the time?

472
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,640
Are you trying to laugh at me?

473
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,319
I was thinking

474
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,400
so that you can tell me yourself?

475
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,240
That you can trust me

476
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,519
trust me,

477
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,519
su Jishi.

478
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,680
You scared me.

479
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,440
What?

480
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,119
Su Jishi.

481
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,000
Su Jishi.

482
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm here.

483
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,079
I've wanted to call you that for a long time.

484
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:10,880
Me too.

485
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,720
To hear you call me that for a long time.

486
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,000
Hold on.

487
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
Do you want to see a super cheap

488
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,400
at a really cheap place?

489
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,599
Why is there one more?

490
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,079
Muhuren kissed me.

491
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,039
About your feelings,

492
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,160
my little experience

493
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,359
that I can share is that

494
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,799
sometimes, two people together

495
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,359
requires the person to make some

496
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,640
and sacrifice.

497
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,799
I got it.

498
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,880
Xiaoman.

499
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,319
Tell me. It's such a cold day.

500
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,559
If there is anything important

501
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,839
If you have any important words

502
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,400
what's wrong? What happened?

503
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,799
Gao Ling, if my surname is not Mu,

504
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,640
could it be that

505
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,759
and fall in love with me?

506
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,200
What do you mean?

507
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,680
From today on,

508
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,599
I am not Mu Xiaoman.

509
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,599
I am only Xiaoman.

510
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,519
You refused to

511
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,359
just because you don't have any financial foundation

512
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,400
so you don't date anyone?

513
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,759
Because you're worried that

514
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,519
because we don't have enough money?

515
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,440
I could just move out

516
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
from home.

517
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Then I have no money.

518
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,160
Can we

519
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,640
we can be together.

520
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,119
Mu Xiaoman, this is too much.

521
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,759
Can you first learn to love yourself

522
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,799
before loving others?

523
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,039
You're too love-minded.

524
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,640
You'll be cheated

525
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,799
to the fullest.

526
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,880
I just love people. So what?

527
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,759
I just like you. What's wrong?

528
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,759
So many people lied to me.

529
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,160
Why couldn't you

530
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,240
to cheat me?

531
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,839
Why? You don't like me at all.

532
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,000
All right. Sorry.

533
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,960
You're not for love?

534
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,599
I was the one who said those wild things.

535
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,359
It's windy by the lake.

536
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,319
The cold air will absorb too much later.

537
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,200
You will have a stomachache again.

538
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,920
Stop crying.

539
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,240
You care so much about me.

540
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,799
Why do you still say you don't like me?

541
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,480
The reason I care about you

542
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,920
because I see you as my sister.

543
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
We can't be in love.

544
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,039
The fireworks look so nice.

545
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,400
Don't cry.

546
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,000
Cry first.

547
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,799
Go home early after watching the fireworks.

548
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,039
See you later.

549
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,759
I'm losing my love.

550
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,799
Why should I have

551
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,400
against such a happy background.

552
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,440
Why is the whole world

553
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,359
Is messing with me?

554
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,759
I went for a date with Miss Su yesterday.

555
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,000
How did it go?

556
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,640
The result is obvious.

557
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,839
To make me happy,

558
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,680
she has

559
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,079
a very big surprise for me.

560
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
She was teasing you?

561
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,559
That's not true.

562
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,160
Hey.

563
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:28,960
Hey.

564
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,599
Are you busy

565
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,039
no, I'm resting.

566
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,799
What's up

567
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,720
wait for me.

568
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,200
Here is the thing.

569
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,640
Gao Ling didn't believe that

570
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,759
that we are seeing each other.

571
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,119
Come on, tell him.

572
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,880
Hello?

573
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
The signal is bad here.

574
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,480
Can you hear me?

575
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,559
To me?

576
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,440
I've been to her.

577
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,720
The signal was really bad.

578
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,440
Wait for me.

579
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
I will call her again.

580
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,599
Hello, the number you dialed

581
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,960
(is busy.)

582
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,319
Please try again later.

583
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,880
Based on what I know about women,

584
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,160
she will say

585
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
my phone's battery is dead.

586
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,920
You know

587
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
are women like that.

588
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,720
She's different.

589
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,720
I know her so well.

590
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,640
She hates

591
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,519
hates cheating the most.

592
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,839
So if she says the battery is out,

593
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,240
then it must be out of power.

594
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,359
Hello, Miss Su.

595
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,880
Just teasing you.

596
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,799
Is it fun?

597
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,119
Let's go for a meeting.

598
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,319
Come on.

599
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Boss first.

600
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,960
That makes sense.

601
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,039
Come, have something hot.

602
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,240
I've been too busy to ask you.

603
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,279
Were you alright yesterday?

604
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,559
Did you catch a cold?

605
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,440
Due to the trauma last night,

606
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,640
how could I not catch a cold?

607
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,559
You're to blame.

608
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,839
If you hadn't refused me,

609
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,519
I'd be fine.

610
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,240
I've never heard that one can catch a cold

611
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,359
you can catch a cold.

612
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,839
Don't blame others

613
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,960
If you don't take care of yourself.

614
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,279
I'm having a hard time.

615
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,200
How can I not catch a cold?

616
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,519
Where are you going?

617
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,759
Sit down first.

618
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,240
Say a few words and run away.

619
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,759
Are you worried that I will infect you?

620
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,839
Stop drinking the coffee. Here.

621
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
Take two tablets once.

622
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,240
Three times a day. These are the same.

623
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,440
Remember to eat it.

624
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,559
This cake is perfect.

625
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,640
She should love it.

626
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,119
What exactly

627
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,400
on your feelings for him now?

628
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:12,799
Do you really

629
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,799
do you really want to be with him?

630
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,559
Have you ever seen a fisherman

631
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,519
serious about the fish in a pond?

632
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,119
It's just a game. You can play.

633
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,920
It's boring to be serious.

634
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,559
But I can see that

635
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,400
he's sincere to you.

636
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,319
The least valuable things in this world

637
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,880
Is being hypocritical.

638
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,720
Have you ever seen a fisherman

639
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,559
serious about the fish in a pond?

640
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,119
It's just a game. You can just play.

641
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,640
You lose when you get serious

642
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,119
If your client

643
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,279
doesn't contact you

644
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,759
without telling you,

645
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
what does that mean?

646
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,160
Five minutes.

647
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,559
You're so attached to your client.

648
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,920
Five minutes?

649
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,720
That was awful.

650
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,519
That's not normal.

651
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,319
What's abnormal?

652
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,359
Is it possible that

653
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,160
she didn't treat you

654
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,240
as her boyfriend.

655
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,759
It seems that she has never

656
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,759
that she likes me.

657
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,759
Right?

658
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,119
No, it's not.

659
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,960
Which screenwriter is

660
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,200
wrote this?

661
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
The hero and the heroine

662
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,079
was so good that they were shared by all.

663
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,640
And this woman keeps him like a fish.

664
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,039
If there's no

665
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,839
going after the husband,

666
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:46,599
I'm sure the scriptwriter

667
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,200
to the scriptwriter. I...

668
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,039
Why are you so upset?

669
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,279
I just want you to practice your lines,

670
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,759
you're not really asked to act.

671
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
But then again,

672
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,279
I know the lines

673
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,480
to practice the lines recently.

674
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,279
His acting.

675
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,480
Nobody can tell that it's an act.

676
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,759
It's true.

677
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,960
In that case, I can't knock off.

678
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,039
I have an important matter

679
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,039
It's something important.

680
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,640
What important thing?

681
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,400
It's a secret.

682
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,360
Do you have a power bank?

683
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,280
My phone's battery is dead.

684
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Little Su.

685
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,800
I ran into Mr. Mu

686
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,679
at the door.

687
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,119
He was here?

688
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,079
But he doesn't look

689
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,559
he doesn't look well.

690
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,440
She is a little angry.

691
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,239
She is angry.

692
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,159
It's bad.

693
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,719
It's a misunderstanding.

694
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,960
Let's go and see how far she goes.

695
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,639
Hurry up!

696
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,480
Alright.

697
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,360
I'll have to take this.

698
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,920
You've finally picked up.

699
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,920
You came to the studio just now.

700
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,079
No, I'm not.

701
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,239
Xiao Xia just said that

702
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,360
she ran into you?

703
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,119
So she should be

704
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,360
my twin brother.

705
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,599
Really?

706
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,840
Mr. Mu's twin brother

707
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,199
Is a little narrow-minded.

708
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,079
I was practicing lines with Fang Jie.

709
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,079
He seemed to be misunderstood.

710
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,639
Practice the lines.

711
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,920
Can you tell

712
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,480
that Mr. Mu's twin brother

713
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,039
ask him not to be so stingy.

714
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,119
To reply to my message.

715
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,159
I have something

716
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,199
something urgent.

717
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,079
One minute left.

718
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,280
Or you'll be too late.

719
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,000
He said that

720
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,719
If you have anything,

721
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,840
you can come to me directly.

722
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,880
Where are you?

723
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:54,880
On the street?

724
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,239
Which street?

725
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,559
Downstairs of the company.

726
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,280
Look at the billboard

727
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
In the mall opposite you.

728
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,760
What's up

729
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,440
from now on,

730
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,119
I'm gonna count to three, two, one.

731
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
You must look carefully.

732
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,159
You can't blink your eyes.

733
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,679
Hey, Doctor Su,

734
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,119
what are you playing now?

735
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,639
Here's the thing.

736
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,400
My time is

737
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,599
Is very precious.

738
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,519
Three.

739
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,360
Two.

740
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,199
-One. -Let's watch the fireworks.

741
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,800
Mr. Mu, I like you.

742
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,239
I really...

743
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,679
Really like you.

744
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,719
That you're my boyfriend

745
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,039
Is my greatest blessing.

746
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,559
Look at that.

747
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,519
What's with the fuss?

748
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,239
My sister-in-law

749
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,199
I wish this luck

750
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,039
can last forever.

751
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,239
Love you.

752
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,280
When people confess their love,

753
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320
so exaggerated?

754
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,119
My sister-in-law is so knowledgeable.

755
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,880
No wonder my brother

756
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,559
he is attracted by

757
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,599
I almost fell in love with her.

758
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,039
I've discussed with the crew

759
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,840
after discussing with the crew.

760
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
Special surprise egg.

761
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,119
To preheat our

762
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,039
our dating variety show.

763
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,840
And launch it in the city.

764
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,039
Are you satisfied, Mr. Mu?

765
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Mr. Mu.

766
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,280
I like you.

767
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,519
Brother Fang,

768
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,199
am I dreaming?

769
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,920
They made such a big noise.

770
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,440
Why don't you inform me in advance?

771
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,480
Oh no. The phones

772
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,039
will be swamped.

773
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,280
Hey!

774
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,079
Yes, that's right.

775
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,519
She is

776
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,239
Is so cool.

777
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,559
Right.

778
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,679
The audience of this show

779
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,559
know that I like you.

780
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,880
What about

781
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,480
just so-so.

782
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,639
Just so-so.

783
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,239
I think you should

784
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,639
to be coaxed by another girlfriend.

785
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,440
You were really hard to coax.

786
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,960
It is really hard to coax me.

787
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,880
And

788
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,239
no one can make me happy except you.

789
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,320
Are you still in the studio?

790
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,320
I'll come to pick you up.

791
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,320
Okay, I'll wait for you.

792
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
Go back to your work.

793
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,119
Alright.

794
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,599
I'm off.

795
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,480
Hug me for a while.

796
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,679
My phone is ringing.

797
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,679
My phone is ringing.

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,079
What phone is ringing?

799
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,119
It can't be heard.

800
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,320
You don't have to hold me so tightly.

801
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,880
It took me so much to win your heart.

802
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,400
That's not right.

803
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,400
It must be you who took great pains

804
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,440
to win me over.

805
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Are you willing to

806
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,159
to let go of me now?

807
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,480
I think it's you who don't want to let go.

808
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,320
Stop messing around. Let me check my phone.

809
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Not at all.

810
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
They are all junk messages.

811
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
Your phone number.

812
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,079
The only one

813
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,920
only Xia

814
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,960
who knew about this.

815
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,519
They wouldn't be

816
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,440
they wouldn't be so insensitive

817
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,760
to disturb us?

818
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,960
Mr. Mu, your analysis

819
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,079
closely reasoned and well argued

820
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:12,920
what if

821
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,000
were really the work messages

822
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,920
fang Xie and Xiaoxia.

823
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,679
What should I do?

824
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,159
How about this?

825
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Let's have a bet.

826
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,639
If I win,

827
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,119
I have one request.

828
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,199
Fine, I'll bet then.

829
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,800
Muhuron. Muhulon.

830
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,679
Are you there

831
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,119
we saw that your mask has been signed for.

832
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,599
Please give us

833
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,079
a five-star review.

834
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,159
I have to go now.

835
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm so sorry!

836
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
Dr. Su!

837
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,280
I can't believe

838
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,360
you'd put so much effort

839
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,480
to chase me.

840
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,599
Give it back to me.

841
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,760
Anyway, I win.

842
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,960
Tell me. What's your condition?

843
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,280
You are not to make

844
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,679
that much.

845
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,199
Don't blush.

846
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,800
Are you thinking about

847
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
about things?

848
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,199
I don't have one.

849
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,840
I mean it's not late

850
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,679
It's not very late anyway.

851
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,000
How about

852
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,719
just drive me home.

853
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,719
I'll walk you and you'll walk me back.

854
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,800
You'll have to take me back.

855
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,599
Isn't that great?

856
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,280
You like driving it?

857
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,519
Did I drive too fast?

858
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,119
Why is it here again?

859
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm off.

860
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,199
Let me hug you for a while.

861
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,840
It's only an hour.

862
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,199
Our home is so close.

863
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,840
I didn't notice this before.

864
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,679
Mu, have you had enough fun?

865
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,639
Can I still go home today?

866
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,719
I can't bear to let you go.

867
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,320
It's already 10 p.m.

868
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,840
You have to work tomorrow?

869
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,559
I have to work.

870
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,599
What if we are both late?

871
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,280
What to do?

872
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,039
Alright.

873
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:24,920
That's enough. Stop here.

874
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,679
-I won't stop. -Good night.
