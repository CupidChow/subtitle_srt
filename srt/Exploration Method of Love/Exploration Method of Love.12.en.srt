1
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
What are you doing?

2
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,879
Having a date.

3
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
What?

4
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,040
Aren't you going to see

5
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,359
your date?

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,879
I'd like to see that.

7
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,959
That can make you refuse?

8
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,199
That my girlfriend

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
which stage?

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Are you sure you want to

11
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,319
drive the car.

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Alright.

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,199
My date today.

14
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,479
Brother, it's you?

15
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,159
Or what?

16
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,719
Let's do this.

17
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Go for it, Gaoling.

18
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,599
Brother.

19
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Thank you.

20
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,039
You're good enough for a lifetime.

21
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,199
Don't reply to my messages.

22
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
Can you get me another bottle?

23
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,480
It's been a long time

24
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,839
play so happily

25
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,759
for a long time.

26
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,240
Thinking about Miss Su?

27
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,800
I can understand that.

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,079
After all, she gets along with you

29
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,839
as her younger sister,

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,319
she'll be cautious.

31
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
She used to

32
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
as Su Jin,

33
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
as Su Jin.

34
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,959
Is going well too.

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,079
Apparently,

36
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,800
for some other reasons,

37
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,759
for other reasons.

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,519
I don't know why,

39
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,120
what could be the reason?

40
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,199
Will it be that dramatic story?

41
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,399
Her sister also...

42
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,639
That's great!

43
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,519
My heart

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
I would lose my heart to you and your sister.

45
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,240
I knew it.

46
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,600
This time,

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
you will never escape from me.

48
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Do you think

49
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,639
when I first met her,

50
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
I should call her Su Jin.

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
You can call her "Honey" instead.

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,040
I can't.

53
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,720
Honey, that sounds too frivolous.

54
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
Why don't you

55
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,040
give her a hug first?

56
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,199
Give her a hug,

57
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,600
will she be scared?

58
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,759
We need to calm down.

59
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,839
Calm down.

60
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,639
Calm down.

61
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,480
Will she think

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,439
I am too indifferent?

63
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,600
Xiaoman.

64
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,920
Do I look fierce at ordinary times?

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,399
Brother, why don't you smile?

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
Look how beautiful Gao Ling is when he smiles.

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,879
Mu Xiaoman, do you want me dead?

68
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,759
Show us.

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,279
Try it.

70
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,160
About the same.

71
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,240
Didn't a love variety show

72
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,639
did you two film together?

73
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,759
You can start now.

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
Hello, everyone. I'm Su Jin.

75
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,000
My boyfriend's name is Mu Huron.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
He's an entrepreneur.

77
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,279
Her name is Su Jin,

78
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,480
she's an actor.

79
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,879
Of course, he wooed me.

80
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I pursued her.

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,199
So what do you like

82
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,199
about him?

83
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,120
All of them.

84
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,399
Pass.

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
How long have you two been together?

86
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,639
We're together

87
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
for over three years.

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
How long have they been dating?

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,639
I don't really remember.

90
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,560
But every day we're together

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
as our first day together.

92
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
♪ The rules of being together ♪

93
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
Give each other space.

94
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,079
Don't be

95
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,519
be with each other all the time.

96
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,600
Be honest and trust each other.

97
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,839
Communication is important.

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
For your next date?

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
For dating?

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,160
Dating places.

101
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Leave the city.

102
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,759
Find a place where we can pitch a tent

103
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,000
and watch the stars.

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,959
What's the most anticipated life partner

105
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,879
looking forward to the most?

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
Is she qualified?

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
She has to be determined and ambitious

108
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,959
with a sense of righteousness.

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,360
Where is my future partner

110
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,480
my future partner

111
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,040
for my future partner.

112
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,319
To have a sense of humor

113
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,720
to have a sense of humor,

114
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,680
and kindness.

115
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
You can't lose your temper

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
because of some trivial things.

117
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,519
Shows utmost respect for women.

118
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,079
Don't be a man.

119
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,360
Alright, the next question.

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
Did you quarrel recently?

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes, we did.

122
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,120
He told the media

123
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
that he would come to record this show,

124
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,480
she didn't discuss this with me.

125
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
Haven't you checked the interview script?

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,879
Why is she answering everything?

127
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
Whatever Little Su wants to say,

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
I couldn't stop her.

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,079
Then

130
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,240
why you don't want to come

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,399
participate in this show?

132
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,360
Because I want a relationship

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,279
between normal people.

134
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,879
Don't worry about their image

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,199
and don't worry about the occasional quarrel

136
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,759
will be misunderstood as breaking up.

137
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,680
Brother Fang.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,199
-Su Su. -You...

139
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,680
There is always a way out.

140
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,519
Hopefully, this is

141
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,560
the most acute problem.

142
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Okay. The last question.

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
Have you ever

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,440
to leave each other,

145
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,840
yes, just recently.

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,919
What happened

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
what happened

148
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,840
I was just joking.

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,679
Where's Mu Hurun?

150
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,759
She's too clingy.

151
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,600
Sometimes I

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,960
I hope he can let it go.

153
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,399
Right?

154
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,559
He wants to be with me

155
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,639
with me every day.

156
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,519
Alright.

157
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,600
In the end, please

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
a question to

159
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
to ask a question.

160
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
What will you ask?

161
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
If there is something

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
that would cause us to break up.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
But that incident

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,759
Is still in the verification stage.

165
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,159
Will you take the initiative

166
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,600
to verify its authenticity?

167
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,320
Thank you for your hard work today.

168
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,159
By the way,

169
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,200
your colleagues will

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,919
you'll have colleagues

171
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,720
to communicate with you.

172
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,840
Please add them by then.

173
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,799
All right.

174
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,639
This

175
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,799
we have some gifts for you.

176
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,320
It's just a small gift.

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Thank you, Secretary Gao.

178
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you very much.

179
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,639
Sorry, there's one more question.

180
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,840
When is the next shooting?

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,879
Keep it a secret.

182
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,720
You have to ensure that it's real.

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,480
I have no problem with that.

184
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,759
The shooting process.

185
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,960
Why keep it a secret?

186
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,399
But I hope that next time,

187
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,480
Is my girlfriend and I

188
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
my girlfriend and I

189
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,159
actually,

190
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,120
there's more separation than meeting someone.

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,799
So, if we

192
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,559
to meet more often

193
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,039
for this program,

194
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,840
that would be too fake, right?

195
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
As for the date location,

196
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
If you don't have enough funds,

197
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
you can tell Gao Ling.

198
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,519
I can personally invest the money.

199
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,320
And,

200
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
our schedule

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,600
has a very, very full schedule.

202
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,120
If every recording

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,039
were just like this,

204
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,080
just relax.

205
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

206
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,960
Good cooperation!

207
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,720
Hello, madam.

208
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,360
I am going out for work,

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,279
not for a date.

210
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,080
I know.

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
I have something for you.

212
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,879
This is the first love letter

213
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,240
I wrote in my life.

214
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,000
You must read it carefully.

215
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Alright.

216
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,879
I'll look at it properly.

217
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,759
Don't overwork yourself.

218
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,320
Read it when you're not tired.

219
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,480
See you later.

220
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,039
I'm leaving then.

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,279
Take care.

222
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,240
Cheers.

223
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,080
This is what normal human beings

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,360
normal humans can eat.

225
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,039
Hold on.

226
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,960
Today,

227
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,039
we're going to celebrate something big.

228
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,519
What?

229
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,039
Because Miss Su is the main character

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
the main character of this love complex.

231
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
The performance

232
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,320
has exceeded

233
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
this year.

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Give her a round of applause.

235
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,759
Applause.

236
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,279
Year-end bonus.

237
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,679
Is huge.

238
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,639
It's a team-building trip.

239
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,960
It's fine.

240
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
Little Su.

241
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,519
Didn't you say you wouldn't do that?

242
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,600
What changed your mind?

243
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,960
Free travel?

244
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,840
We have food and fun.

245
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,639
Why don't you go?

246
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,759
Tell me the truth.

247
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,879
Are you accepting the variety show

248
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,919
because of us?

249
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,639
Certainly not.

250
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm not going to force myself

251
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
to do something I dislike.

252
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,279
Stop denying it.

253
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Let's toast to Little Su.

254
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,759
I feel so lucky to have Little Su

255
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,320
to work with you!

256
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,159
What are you doing?

257
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,399
You make it like I'm leaving?

258
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,240
Touch wood!

259
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,279
Don't say that.

260
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,519
By the way, Fang Jie,

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm

262
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,840
a professional actor.

263
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,720
You said that making a comprehensive report

264
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,279
Is easier than acting.

265
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,440
Of course it's.

266
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,399
Very simple.

267
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Is that so?

268
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,279
It's a variety show.

269
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,120
Just be yourself.

270
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,879
If it's harder than acting,

271
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
I'll be beheaded.

272
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,200
I hope so.

273
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,039
Here you are.

274
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,440
Thank you.

275
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,679
Please spare the director team.

276
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,360
You and Miss Su

277
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,720
are really made for each other.

278
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,639
The Snow Mountain Sinkhole?

279
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,320
Snow mountain sinkhole,

280
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,279
tropical rain forest

281
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,000
and volcanic cave,

282
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,320
sahara,

283
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
exactly.

284
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,200
We're doing a love synthesis,

285
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,639
not the series next door.

286
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,080
The "Survival in the Wild."

287
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,320
But even if Forest Park...

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
In the eyes of

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,399
may be considered

290
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,840
Is an artificial bonsai.

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,639
Do you understand

292
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
mr. Mu, with all due respect,

293
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,600
If you're trying to draw connections,

294
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,240
I think

295
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,639
the date place is not the most important.

296
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,399
How you perform

297
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,919
I think

298
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,559
dr. Su is an independent woman.

299
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,480
Instead of taking care of her by force,

300
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
you should give her the space

301
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,639
to express her own ideas.

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
I mean, this idea of yours

303
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,879
has a tacit understanding with Xiaoman.

304
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
The demon king is recording a program.

305
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,440
What a perfect weekend.

306
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
I'm walking the dog.

307
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,159
Hello

308
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,559
nice to meet you, Erbai.

309
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,759
Nice to meet you.

310
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,759
Isn't it enough that she wrote a love letter,

311
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,039
she even followed you.

312
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,960
Sir, you take her first.

313
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,759
You're leaving?

314
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,240
Does he do shopping on weekends?

315
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,600
Are still here.

316
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,440
Kaolin?

317
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,360
Gao Ling.

318
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,279
Gao Ling, what's the matter?

319
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,960
Say something. What's going on?

320
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,399
One hundred and twenty.

321
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Are you willing to come out?

322
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,000
The girl.

323
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,679
Don't follow me.

324
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,120
Why are you crying?

325
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,080
Xiaoman.

326
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,399
Xiaoman.

327
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,840
Just round it.

328
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,240
You're out in the wild.

329
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
Pay attention to the details and expressions.

330
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,000
Be careful.

331
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,639
If only these people

332
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,399
these people would just disappear.

333
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,480
Thanks.

334
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,480
When these cameras

335
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,599
exist,

336
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,559
how about this?

337
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,680
What if the production group

338
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,839
later on.

339
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,839
It doesn't matter.

340
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,200
Anyway, I only care

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,559
Is how you feel.

342
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,599
Don't see him for days.

343
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,400
How come he changed to playing straight?

344
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:31,759
Right.

345
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,079
I watched the interview

346
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,480
I watched the interview they had for you.

347
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,920
Is that the truth?

348
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:41,920
Certainly.

349
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,960
Alright.

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
I'll work according to your standard

351
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,480
and improve.

352
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,680
Alright.

353
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,039
To improve yourself.

354
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,480
I just want to make you quit.

355
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
Brother.

356
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,440
Oh, right.

357
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,640
The last question you left me.

358
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,680
I can answer you now.

359
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,079
If there's anything

360
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,680
that would cause us to break up.

361
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,519
But that incident

362
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,279
Is still in the verification stage.

363
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,200
Will you take the initiative

364
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,480
to check whether it's real or not?

365
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,000
The answer is...

366
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:24,920
It will.

367
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,799
First of all, I don't think

368
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,799
I don't think any external event

369
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,200
that can affect our relationship?

370
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,119
Second,

371
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,680
I hope that we can

372
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,759
and trust each other.

373
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,640
No matter what problems we have,

374
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,160
we can still be honest with each other

375
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,440
and face it together.

376
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,039
Are you saying that I'm not honest?

377
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,079
I want to do that.

378
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:45,920
Let me ask you something.

379
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,680
Are you really

380
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,720
the man my sister likes.

381
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,119
Right.

382
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,759
You don't even know that my sister and I are two people.

383
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,759
Are two people, right?

384
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,079
You're wrong, Su Jishi.

385
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
Actually, I already knew it.

386
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,759
I really don't understand.

387
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,119
Why you were

388
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,480
why are you uncomfortable?

389
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,680
Even if there are problems,

390
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,240
we can still be honest with each other

391
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,240
and face it together.

392
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,279
Alright.

393
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,519
I'll give you 100% for your answer.

394
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,640
Then can you answer

395
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,799
to answer my question?

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,240
If that's the case,

397
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,599
let's find out

398
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
If you are the man my sister likes.

399
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,640
Only if you behave yourself.

400
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,839
Since we're camping,

401
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,680
since we're here for camping.

402
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,839
Please.

403
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,400
You won't go together?

404
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,039
I won't.

405
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,079
You won't do it?

406
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Are you sure about this?

407
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,640
Is it a test to see

408
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,720
alright.

409
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't you need to read the manual?

410
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,000
No need.

411
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,799
Today he taught me how to pitch a tent.

412
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,119
When he put his hand

413
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,119
help me set up the tent.

414
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,519
I suddenly saw

415
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,759
our future home.

416
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,160
I didn't expect that

417
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,160
mr. Mu, you really know how to pitch a tent?

418
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,279
It's much easier to guess

419
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,359
to guess Miss Su's thoughts.

420
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,240
I won't be a bother.

421
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,119
Build it yourself.

422
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,160
Will he be angry?

423
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,359
Xiaoman.

424
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,160
Come on.

425
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,559
Please forgive me.

426
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,160
Don't call me lady.

427
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,759
Alright.

428
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,119
Then tell me, what shall I call you?

429
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,079
My girlfriend?

430
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,400
Not this.

431
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,880
That's high.

432
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
I'll say this one more time.

433
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
I really like you.

434
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
Xiaoman.

435
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,640
What you are doing is not realistic.

436
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,880
Why is it unrealistic?

437
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,240
No matter how you think,

438
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,359
I will be responsible for

439
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,640
for my feelings in you.

440
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,359
You said I didn't know you well enough.

441
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,279
That's why I followed you secretly.

442
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,400
I wanted to know

443
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,240
what you did

444
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,319
during the vacation?

445
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,799
What would you like to eat

446
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,680
what music are you listening to

447
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,319
In your headphones?

448
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,359
Which do you prefer, cats or dogs?

449
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,039
I want to

450
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,920
and become

451
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,000
and become the person you want me to be.

452
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,839
If I have tried my best

453
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,599
I don't make you like me,

454
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,599
that's my own business.

455
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,799
It's none of your business.

456
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,519
Then you...

457
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,799
You can fly wherever you want.

458
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't worry.

459
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,000
But the peak

460
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,680
before this,

461
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,880
I won't take back

462
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,279
about you.

463
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,119
I was being impulsive.

464
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,519
This is too impulsive.

465
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,400
That knows how to pitch a tent.

466
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,759
He's not the only one.

467
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,319
Su Jin,

468
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,559
why are you here?

469
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,880
The tent is set up.

470
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,519
Actually, I was just kidding.

471
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,799
What I mean is

472
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,319
I want to know

473
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,920
what is on your mind.

474
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,279
He taught me how to set up tents

475
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,759
as a return,

476
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,359
I taught him to skip water

477
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,359
but he couldn't learn it anyway.

478
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,960
He even stopped me from laughing at him.

479
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,160
You can skip the stone.

480
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,759
When did you learn?

481
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,079
When I was a child,

482
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,720
four or five years old.

483
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,039
If you want to learn,

484
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,599
you want to learn.

485
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,480
That's different when you're four or five.

486
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Young people are being humble.

487
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,319
Come on.

488
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
To see what Mr. Mu has done.

489
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,880
What about

490
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,039
It's alright.

491
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,599
Nothing special.

492
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,400
It seems that

493
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,599
nothing special,

494
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,160
but the connotation counts.

495
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,119
Please.

496
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
I can't tell

497
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,960
Is really attentive.

498
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,079
What do you think? To your liking?

499
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,599
These are

500
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,039
like these.

501
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,359
How old do you think I am?

502
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,680
I love it, but still stubborn.

503
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,960
To others,

504
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,799
the tent is just a tool

505
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,799
survival in the wild.

506
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,519
But in fact,

507
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,359
It can also be a comfortable place to live.

508
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,680
Very relaxed and at ease.

509
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
It's like we are doing a TV show.

510
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,599
It seems that you're acting for the others.

511
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,039
But actually

512
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,480
you can find the happiness

513
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,319
the happiness you want.

514
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,200
I'll do it. Just wait and see.

515
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,200
How is it?

516
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
I think it's not.

517
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,839
Be careful. They are here.

518
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,880
Who are they?

519
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,039
Who?

520
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,599
It's a surprise.

521
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,400
Little Su.

522
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,079
Hello

523
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,319
long time no see

524
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
long time no see

525
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
let me make an introduction.

526
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,039
This is Chen Shiyi.

527
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,359
She is my schoolmate.

528
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm not just your alumni

529
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,039
your university alumnus.

530
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm also your

531
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
your rumored girlfriend back then.

532
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,359
It was just a joke between the students.

533
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,240
Right.

534
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:19,839
After I graduated,

535
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,799
after I graduated.

536
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,839
But when I came here this time,

537
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,440
It's

538
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I think my trip

539
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,519
to come.

540
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,160
Me too.

541
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,720
After much hesitation,

542
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,599
whether to come or not.

543
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,119
But the moment I saw Little Su,

544
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
I thought it was all worth it.

545
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,079
Little Su.

546
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,759
What are you doing?

547
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,519
Brother Qin Qiu.

548
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,519
It seems that your Little Su

549
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,839
not so impressed

550
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,279
that impressed me.

551
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,680
Little Su, this is too much.

552
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,039
You even forgot our

553
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,319
back then.

554
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,200
Are you not feeling well?

555
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Yes, my head hurts.

556
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
Let me send you home to have a rest.

557
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,119
Please excuse me.

558
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,519
I'll go up by myself.

559
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,480
Just rest for a while.

560
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,559
Don't follow me.

561
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,599
Go to look after

562
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,640
your old friends

563
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,839
don't just leave them there.

564
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,880
Then you...

565
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:44,920
Little Su.

566
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,839
What about

567
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,839
It's easier than you thought, right?

568
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,920
My head is still around, right?

569
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,559
He is.

570
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,480
It's strange.

571
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,000
Tell me who Qin Qiu is.

572
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,519
Why did he come here?

573
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,039
And what's his relationship with my sister?

574
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
Why is Qin Qiu here?

575
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,079
Or what?

576
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,880
How many heads you have now,

577
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
are not enough anymore.

578
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,480
Tell me quickly.

579
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,799
Alright.

580
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,400
Little Su, you must remember this.

581
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,119
This Qin Qiu

582
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,440
which is extremely dangerous.

583
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,480
What's wrong with Qin Qiu?

584
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,079
That Qin Qiu

585
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,680
was Little Su three years ago.

586
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,559
No, the rumoured boyfriend of my sister-in-law.

587
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
At that time, my sister-in-law

588
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,279
she participated in

589
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,920
a sports meeting for new artists.

590
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
She was in the

591
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,599
In the competition

592
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,519
will be Qin Qiu.

593
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,960
They have a great teamwork.

594
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,079
The audience loved their team.

595
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
At the time, they became

596
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,079
the hottest sibling group at that time.

597
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,440
I have confirmed the rumor.

598
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,839
Qin Qiu really liked sister-in-law back then.

599
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
And best sibling partnership.

600
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,640
I even chased my sister.

601
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,720
What am I supposed to do?

602
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,680
That Qin Qiu

603
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
although he rarely

604
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,599
with Xiao Jin later,

605
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,359
but everything is going well.

606
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,839
You'd better not give yourself away.

607
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,400
I'll come back for you!

608
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,799
Take care, bye.

609
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,000
Little Su, come and sit down.

610
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,480
Huron.

611
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,279
Sit here.

612
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:15,920
Mr. Mu.

613
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,480
Sit down.

614
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,039
Let's play turtle, shall we?

615
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,920
Boring and childish.

616
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,680
Come on.

617
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,680
Su Jishi, are you silly?

618
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
Let me explain the rules.

619
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,160
This is the turtle card.

620
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
Divide it by four.

621
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:46,960
Draw the opponent's cards

622
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
to draw the opponent's card.

623
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,960
Two cards of the same kind

624
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,759
you can throw them away.

625
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,960
Who is it?

626
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,119
The last one who has the tortoise

627
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
will be the loser.

628
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,640
I didn't expect the first loser

629
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,440
to be me.

630
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,839
How about this? I'll choose Truth.

631
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,839
OK.

632
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,920
Why are you looking at me?

633
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,799
Let me ask you this.

634
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,359
Xiaoqiu, I heard that you once

635
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,839
you used to like Su Jin

636
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,599
and even chased her.

637
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,519
Is it true

638
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
It's really

639
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,839
sister Su Jin is

640
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,799
very important.

641
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,000
If I win,

642
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,960
my luck is on.

643
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,839
How could I win all of them?

644
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,200
Huron, you lost.

645
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,279
Fine, then I'll choose Truth too.

646
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,920
I heard

647
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,759
because the outside world suspected that

648
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,559
you and Su Jin are a fake couple.

649
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,279
So you came here

650
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,000
Is to dispel

651
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
the doubt of the public, right?

652
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
We're not on this show

653
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,920
Is not to protect the public from suspicion.

654
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
But to strengthen both of us

655
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,880
firmer with each other.

656
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,680
Right?

657
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:54,559
Well

658
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,640
go on.

659
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,200
But let me tell you something.

660
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,039
That in the next round,

661
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,359
choose Truth.

662
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,559
Or Dare.

663
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,319
I lost.

664
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,039
Little Su.

665
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,400
Don't let him off easily

666
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,359
this time.

667
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,839
Mu Huron.

668
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,079
Sing a song.

669
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,960
Little Su.

670
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,799
You're exaggerating.

671
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,640
Have you ever heard of

672
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,519
my family's singing?

673
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,799
My family

674
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,440
huron is

675
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
Is such a good singer.

676
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,759
It's so exciting.

677
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Come on, sing a song.

678
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,279
You can sing anything, right?

679
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,039
My dear baby.

680
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,240
You're as beautiful as the stars

681
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,480
as the stars

682
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
we sat together in a tent,

683
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,920
when he played the piano, I sang.

684
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,079
I was so relaxed.

685
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
I wrote him a quiet song

686
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,640
quiet song for him.

687
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
So he can sing it for the kids later.

688
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,799
My dear baby,

689
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,160
the stars in the sky are as beautiful as you are.

690
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,559
Sleep quickly.

691
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,319
I'll be by your side.

692
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,680
♪ And make you not afraid of the dark ♪

693
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,839
My dear baby,

694
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,240
you're as beautiful as the stars

695
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,519
as the stars in the sky.

696
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,519
Go to sleep.

697
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,480
Please.

698
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,960
The person you like

699
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,640
Is really Mu Hurun?

700
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,880
My dear baby.

701
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,920
You're as beautiful as the stars

702
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,359
as the stars in the sky.

703
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:39,319
Go to sleep.

704
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,279
I will be by your side.

705
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Baby.

706
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,200
Sis,

707
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,279
can we take a break?

708
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,720
Hang in there. We'll arrive soon.

709
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,079
Come on.

710
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,480
You didn't call me for the morning jog?

711
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,599
I thought

712
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,000
sound asleep.

713
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,039
Breakfast for you.

714
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,760
It contains

715
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,719
your favorite salty soybean milk.

716
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,360
We have had it already.

717
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,079
Look at my running.

718
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,760
While running.

719
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,039
I have to go back and change my clothes.

720
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:23,920
Xia, let's go.

721
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,800
Good morning, Mr. Mu.

722
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:28,880
Xiaoxia, hurry up.

723
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,760
Bye, Mr. Mu.

724
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,079
What now?

725
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,360
The task card.

726
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,199
Today, please drive to

727
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,880
lake Lover in Forest Park.

728
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,760
Fish and have a picnic there,

729
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,360
and shoot promotional photos for the show.

730
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,920
Alright. Let's go.

731
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:00,840
Huron.

732
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,119
I'm afraid I'll get dizzy sitting at the back.

733
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,920
Can I sit in the front passenger seat?

734
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,519
You won't mind that, right?

735
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,559
Alright.

736
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
Qin Qiu can please drive.

737
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,840
Where's my co-driver?

738
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,639
Girlfriend only.

739
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,639
Thanks.

740
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,039
Let me take it.

741
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,519
Sit still.

742
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,880
Is that obvious enough?

743
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,440
Would you give up?

744
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,719
You scared him out of his heart attack.

745
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,199
Did you think that everyone has left

746
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,280
never thought the kind and lovely me

747
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,679
waiting for you for dinner?

748
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,119
Are you surprised?

749
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,119
We're in the office.

750
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,559
If anyone sees this,

751
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,599
It's a bad influence.

752
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,119
You're still scared?

753
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,599
You were so nice to me last night.

754
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,840
You still care about me.

755
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,000
Your brother texted me

756
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,239
and asked me to go to work.

757
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
He wouldn't let you have lunch time.

758
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,400
How could he do that?

759
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,519
I'll talk to him.

760
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,280
What a temporary thing.

761
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
I'll help you do it with you.

762
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,559
No need.

763
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:41,920
New business.

764
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,239
The new business.

765
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,039
How about this? You eat first.

766
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,159
Pack some for me after that.

767
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,519
That's fine.

768
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,400
Secretary Gao.

769
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,719
Today,

770
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
which girlfriend did you meet

771
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
the bento for you.

772
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,320
They made it.

773
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,119
I've arranged it meticulously.

774
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,079
You said I was the shopkeeper,

775
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
to spy on me?

776
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,880
Don't do that again.

777
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
Put more patience into your work.

778
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,440
What's wrong with you today?

779
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,599
Nothing.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
Then why are you avoiding seeing me?

781
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,159
Come on.

782
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,079
Are you feeling jealous

783
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,119
because of Chen Shiyi?

784
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,079
That's impossible.

785
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,239
Then why are you doing this?

786
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,079
Little Su.

787
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,360
Mr. Mu.

788
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,239
It's an emergency.

789
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,639
The director just informed me that

790
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,039
photographer was late.

791
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,039
So now we are having

792
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,280
are free.

793
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,679
We can do fishing

794
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,559
and barbecue.

795
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,159
Never mind. I still want to go back.

796
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,800
Fine. We'll fish.

797
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,880
Let's see who can catch

798
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,119
to see who can catch the most.

799
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,400
If I win,

800
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,679
tell me why.

801
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,719
Why should I?

802
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
Miss Su, are you afraid to lose?

803
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,639
I'm afraid to lose.

804
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,960
Okay, let's play.

805
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,880
If you win,

806
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,400
I will tell you.

807
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,639
But if you lose,

808
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,639
don't think about

809
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,639
ask me this question.

810
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,320
Please.

811
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:46,920
Huron.

812
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,800
Thank you.

813
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:49,719
Not at all.

814
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,719
But for a fishing expert,

815
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,679
It's hard for her.

816
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,960
Little Su, thank you for your hard work.

817
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,960
No need to be so polite.

818
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
She's so young.

819
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,639
And still need to grow up. Come on.

820
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,960
What do you want?

821
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
Judging from the fish's cutting technique,

822
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,159
I think it's made by me.

823
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
I'm responsible for it.

824
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,400
The fish...

825
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Obviously, I'm the one who made this blade skill.

826
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,119
Qin Qiu, come here.

827
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,320
There's too much chili in this fish.

828
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,760
You know me.

829
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
That I have a bad taste.

830
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:25,880
He's not used to it.

831
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,159
Come to Qin Qiu.

832
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,199
I hope you have something big.

833
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,079
Tell me the story.

834
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,000
What do you call this fish?

835
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
This one and those two fishes

836
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
we are a family.

837
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,840
I don't want to break them up.

838
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,960
You childish ghost.

839
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,239
Sister.

840
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,480
Sister, let's go fix our makeup.

841
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,840
The photographer is here.

842
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,440
Sis, let's finish up and go to the car

843
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,000
and have a rest.

844
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,079
Wait for the filming schedule.

845
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,679
Sis, slow down.

846
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,920
Petty, narcissistic and jealous.

847
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,320
Why would someone

848
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,400
who likes this kind of person.

849
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,679
I really regret it.

850
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,840
There's no camera here.

851
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,119
Make it clear.

852
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,519
Let go of me!

853
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,320
Let go of me!

854
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,320
Let go of me.

855
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,239
Muhuron.

856
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,880
Do I believe in your story?

857
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,559
Why do you treat Qin Qiu so well?

858
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,920
Are you trying to make me jealous?

859
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,199
First Chen Shiyi, then Qin Qiu.

860
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:43,840
What is our relationship?

861
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
What are you jealous of?

862
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,000
With Gao Zhenhe?

863
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,679
I kissed you in front of

864
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,440
In front of so many media.

865
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,480
We're still recording

866
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,159
a couple show.

867
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,079
Take couple photos later.

868
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,239
What do you think is our relationship?

869
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,840
Of course, we are working.

870
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,079
You're a lookout.

871
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,679
Assistant teacher.

872
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,360
Hasn't Mr Su changed?

873
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,559
The scene is ready.

874
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,519
I'll urge them immediately, don't worry.

875
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,280
Hurry up.

876
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,559
How can I urge you now?

877
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,599
Do you still think

878
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,760
It's a work relationship.

879
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,000
Or what?

880
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,119
Propose to Aunt Hua,

881
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,159
kiss and the press.

882
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,360
Dating, tackling the rumors.

883
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,480
Which one isn't work?

884
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,039
Sister, please hurry up.

885
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,480
The scene is rushed.

886
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,360
The director is waiting outside.

887
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,519
Sister, we haven't changed.

888
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,599
Sister, where are we going to change?

889
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:45,880
Over there.

890
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,800
Get closer to each other.

891
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,400
Let's try another pose.

892
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,719
We can do it like this.

893
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Thank you, mentors.

894
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,800
Alright.

895
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,400
Shoot completed.

896
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,920
Thank you, director.

897
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,599
And have a rest.

898
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,039
Alright.

899
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,800
Ask Miss Su and Mr. Mu to come here.

900
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,039
Mentors.

901
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,840
Let's take a few photos to see how it feels.

902
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,760
Three, two, one.

903
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:12,840
This is not right.

904
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,920
Can you get a little closer?

905
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:23,360
Let's touch each other.

906
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,360
Did you two kiss

907
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,440
In front of reporters.

908
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,280
It was very good.

909
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,519
Can you recreate that

910
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,679
that's too fake.

911
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,840
The effect is not good.

912
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,320
Director, I think
