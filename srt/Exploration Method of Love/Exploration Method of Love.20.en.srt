1
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,079
Mu Huron.

2
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,840
Do you have to

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
to do such a thing?

4
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,719
I will definitely bring the samples back.

5
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,480
I promise.

6
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,280
You are good at acting when they fight

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,040
or is it that

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
mr. Su is too suspicious?

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,719
If girls in general

10
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,640
If it's a girl.

11
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,400
If she believed it

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
with a few words,

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,879
she won't be

14
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,080
the Su Jishi I like.

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Scientists...

16
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,199
They pay attention to evidence.

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,039
You are proud of her.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,719
It's okay for you to enter the mountain alone.

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,599
It's fine.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,240
By the way,

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
how about the thing I told you?

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,960
Before the final result is known,

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,759
until the final result is known.

24
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,919
To keep it a secret

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,479
to prevent any complications.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,919
I know.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,879
I know the pros and cons.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,879
If I leak it out

29
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,800
about this in advance,

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,319
you and your Second Uncle got hostile.

31
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,719
It would be better if we could prove that he lied.

32
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,919
But what if

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
Is different from your decision,

34
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,680
he will definitely hold onto it.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
New problems crop up unexpectedly

36
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,360
then your status in Mu's Group

37
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,879
In Mu's Group.

38
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,159
That's why

39
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
must be finalized this time.

40
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,080
There can't be any more accidents.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
Xiaoman and Ji Shi

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,879
help me keep an eye on him.

43
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,639
Got it.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,759
Little Su,

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,919
Isn't it uncomfortable?

46
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,479
Is it comfortable?

47
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,400
Brother Fang!

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,039
Brother Fang!

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,439
Little Su ran away.

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,319
There she goes!

51
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,800
There they are!

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
How... How could it be?

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,319
I've guarded it well.

54
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,960
You must've slept like a dog.

55
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,960
But I only closed one glance.

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,759
Show me

57
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,599
Is there anything left in it?

58
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,759
To see if she's still inside.

59
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,280
Come here!

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,639
Come on.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,920
I'd better tell him this

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,959
lest he might be worried.

63
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,839
He went to the mountain so early.

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,439
I'll make it in time.

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Mr. Mu and I will go hiking in the mountain.

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Don't worry when you're back at night.

67
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,959
Didn't they have a fight?

68
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,040
When did they make up?

69
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,279
We don't know.

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,120
Yesterday, Mr. Mu

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,199
carried Miss Su back to the room.

72
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,079
They were chatting

73
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,120
for a long time.

74
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,439
When we came out, Mr. Mu said

75
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,680
he asked us to keep an eye on Miss Su

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
don't let her climb the mountain.

77
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,680
In the end, she ran away.

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,879
What are they doing?

79
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,439
What?

80
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,160
They went there for the same reason.

81
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,360
We might bump into each other.

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
Take care of each other. It's okay.

83
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
He's already gone.

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,839
Now I can only

85
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,959
that's all I can do.

86
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,279
Miss Su has so much field experience.

87
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,120
He has so much field experience.

88
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,319
It should be nothing

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm worried

90
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,839
that she may get too excited

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
have much enjoyment and forget to go back home

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,399
don't worry.

93
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,839
Mr. Mu is still here.

94
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,240
They should have

95
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,959
at this moment.

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,759
This is strange.

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,319
The mining area is after this mountain.

98
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,680
Where exactly is Muhurun?

99
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,759
Mu Huron.

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,079
Muhuron.

101
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,879
Muhuron.

102
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,680
Muhuron.

103
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,240
Be careful

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,639
mu Hurun, what's wrong with you?

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Do you know how dangerous it is

106
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,920
to go up a mountain alone?

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,920
Are you injured?

108
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,439
What happened to you?

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,879
You were worried about me?

110
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,519
Who's worried about you?

111
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,600
Why are you laughing at this point?

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,439
What are you laughing at?

113
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,000
I promised you that I did it.

114
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you still think

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,079
I'm just a businessman?

116
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,720
Shut up.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,319
It's impossible.

118
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
It's impossible to reach Miss Su either.

119
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,800
It's almost dark outside.

120
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
They still haven't come back.

121
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,320
Don't worry.

122
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,159
Maybe she's on the way back.

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,360
I originally planned to

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,600
be able to go back tonight.

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,039
But the mountain road is too dangerous at night.

126
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,840
And we can't go back.

127
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,120
I think Xiaoxia and Xiaoman

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
will be worried sick.

129
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,440
Don't worry.

130
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,759
Gao Ling and Fang Jie are there.

131
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,120
It'll be all right.

132
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,480
Sleep for a while if you're tired.

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Stay with you.

134
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,639
I'll be with you.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,879
Calm down.

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,799
I've contacted

137
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,000
professional search and rescue team has entered the mountain.

138
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,919
We'll certainly find it.

139
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,720
There will be news

140
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,639
when they wake up tomorrow.

141
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,600
I can't. I'll call the police.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,200
You can't call the police.

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't call the police?

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Why not?

145
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,279
Your sister-in-law is a public figure.

146
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
The press will be here

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
reporters will surely come.

148
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,600
And then it'll be a trending topic.

149
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,480
Aunt Hua saw this.

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Don't you worry?

151
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,840
Secretary Gao has asked the

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,639
a professional search and rescue team.

153
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,480
To look for her.

154
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,080
Let's not bother the police.

155
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,759
Then the internet

156
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,720
spout nonsense on the Internet again.

157
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,240
It'll be a bad influence to Miss Su.

158
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,039
She is gone.

159
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,120
Still cares about this mess?

160
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,799
What do you mean?

161
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,679
They've been in the mountain for less than a day.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,919
The supplies they brought

163
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,799
enough for four to five days.

164
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,480
We can certainly hold on till the rescue team comes.

165
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,200
Don't worry.

166
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,759
Your sister-in-law is here.

167
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,799
Little Su is not an immortal

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,639
how about this?

169
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,039
By noon tomorrow,

170
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,840
If we still

171
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
no news,

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,159
I will call the police and...

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,919
Those who are sleepy now should sleep.

174
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,240
Even Little Su is still in the wild.

175
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
Who can sleep now?

176
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,120
Exactly.

177
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,879
That'd take a lot of care

178
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,960
to be sleepy.

179
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,759
She hasn't come back yet.

180
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,039
Whatever, I'll call the police.

181
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,120
Xiaoman.

182
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,960
Hello, Miss Su.

183
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
My Sister Su!

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,879
You are finally back.

185
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,399
I'm sorry, Xiaoman.

186
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,840
I made you worry.

187
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,360
Alright.

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,559
Isn't your brother back?

189
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
You should be happy.

190
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,440
Stop crying.

191
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,120
What's wrong with you two?

192
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,679
Fang Xie Xiaoxia,

193
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,159
I bet you haven't eaten well.

194
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,759
I'll take you out

195
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,879
have a good meal to cool you down.

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,440
Alright.

197
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,399
You two can talk.

198
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,200
Come on.

199
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,679
We'll leave now.

200
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,440
You said that

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
now you have a girlfriend.

202
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,519
She's my sister.

203
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,559
I don't believe you.

204
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
You believe it, right?

205
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
Being so tired,

206
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,799
and I see illusions again.

207
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,440
Brother.

208
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,279
I pestered and chased him.

209
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,000
No, I mean...

210
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
I chased her.

211
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,759
Speak your mind?

212
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,360
I must be with him.

213
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Does Mom know about this?

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,360
She knows.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
She's very satisfied with Gao Ling.

216
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
And my wife knows that

217
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
she really supports us.

218
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,799
Brother, you won't disagree.

219
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,600
Right?

220
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,279
So we spent so much time

221
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm the only one who doesn't know?

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,559
No.

223
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,039
We've long wanted to tell you this,

224
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,039
but I never had

225
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,960
the right opportunity.

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
And we're not

227
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,399
keep it from you on purpose.

228
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,480
It's very clear

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,759
It was very clear

230
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,600
you didn't think that way.

231
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
You didn't tell me because you were afraid

232
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,279
because you were afraid I would object.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
You're my best friend.

234
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,360
You're my sister.

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,840
Now you're the girlfriend

236
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,159
the girlfriend of my best friend.

237
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,759
You've become

238
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,039
my sister's boyfriend.

239
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay, let's not talk about this first.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,559
Xiaoman.

241
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,039
I also know that

242
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,879
gao Ling has always taken care of you.

243
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,519
Can you tell the difference

244
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,759
I can distinguish between love and habit.

245
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,399
I can distinguish between.

246
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,600
I really like him.

247
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,399
Gao Ling, you have to work?

248
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,200
Or my sister?

249
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
Only one?

250
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm serious too.

251
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
I wish you all the best.

252
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,360
That's great.

253
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,399
My brother approves of our being together.

254
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,600
Xiaoman's sleeping.

255
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,080
Yes, I didn't sleep much last night.

256
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,279
You fell asleep right after lying down.

257
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,919
Mr. Mu.

258
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,759
That's not right.

259
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,440
Brother.

260
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,320
I...

261
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,759
Enough.

262
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,879
I also know

263
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,000
towards Xiaoman.

264
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
You don't need to make any stance.

265
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,159
I won't betray your trust.

266
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,000
These are newly collected samples.

267
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,559
I will take these samples back

268
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,600
for testing tomorrow.

269
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,039
Once the report comes out,

270
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
once the report comes out.

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,279
At once.

272
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,080
It seems that you are going to

273
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,279
be scolded by those old men again.

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,039
Miss Su.

275
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,519
I know

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,360
to you researchers,

277
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
the meaning of new things

278
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
than money.

279
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,639
But to ordinary people,

280
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,200
however important it is,

281
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,879
nothing can compare to

282
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,919
In your pocket.

283
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,440
Mr. Mu's decision this time

284
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,080
requires a lot of courage.

285
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,480
What a sacrifice.

286
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,120
Did you talk too much today?

287
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,039
Mr. Mu may be

288
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,320
the CEO of Mu's Group,

289
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,519
but Mu's Group is not...

290
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,600
His own.

291
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,240
His decision this time

292
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,200
will be criticized

293
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,320
more criticism than ever before,

294
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,600
as I have done.

295
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
I suddenly seem to find

296
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,440
you and Xiaoman are indeed not suitable for each other.

297
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,360
Okay, that's it.

298
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
No need to make me leave.

299
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,879
Good night, Brother.

300
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,399
Don't listen to Gao Ling either.

301
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,360
To be scolded

302
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,720
I won't hurt

303
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,679
even if I get scolded.

304
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,679
She would be alright.

305
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,759
You won't lose any meat.

306
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,360
Actually, Gao Ling is right.

307
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,000
I thought

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,159
as simple as that.

309
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,879
My only wish

310
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,279
to prove my theories.

311
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,399
But I didn't expect that

312
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,200
this would bring

313
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,399
bring so much pressure to you.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,919
Then

315
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,360
to compensate me.

316
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,080
For the shareholders' meeting.

317
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
The shareholders' meeting

318
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,799
to announce

319
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,200
very important to announce.

320
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,480
The exploitation of the Yiliangshan mine

321
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
must stop immediately.

322
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,159
Mr. Mu, don't be angry.

323
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
Mu Huron.

324
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,720
What's the madness about?

325
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,600
The efforts of so many people

326
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,759
and resources into this project.

327
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,279
Why should I stop it?

328
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,240
What is the reason?

329
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,440
What is the reason?

330
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,279
Because there are new minerals in Yiliang Mountain.

331
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,600
What's going on?

332
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,320
The Yiliangshan Mine

333
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,639
has just resumed work a few months ago.

334
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,759
After what you've done,

335
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
are you going to suspend the mining area for several years again?

336
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,480
Who will be responsible for the losses?

337
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:03,679
Gao Shan.

338
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
This is the test report

339
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
from a domestic testing agency.

340
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,279
It proves that

341
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,640
the existence of new minerals in Yiliang Mountain.

342
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,920
The Mu's Research Institute

343
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
has applied for international accreditation.

344
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,519
Do you know why

345
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,200
has Mu's new mineral research

346
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,119
made no progress in the past few years?

347
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,799
Because someone tried to sabotage our research

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,920
and sabotaged the research.

349
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,839
In the past few years,

350
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,759
sent to the lab these years

351
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,640
they're all fake!

352
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,599
They were fakes in the past.

353
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Who can prove it's true now?

354
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,680
I...

355
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,759
How can you prove it?

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,039
Because the ore samples

357
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,759
were personally

358
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,039
from the mine myself.

359
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,200
From the mine.

360
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
For its authenticity.

361
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,920
Of course,

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,839
If you have doubts,

363
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,640
we can do the double check.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
As for the switch of samples

365
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,839
changing the sample,

366
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,920
the company

367
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,799
has also set up

368
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,680
to conduct

369
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,799
to conduct an internal investigation.

370
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,000
When did you come?

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,799
You scared me.

372
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,200
After shooting, I came here.

373
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,759
I missed you. Look at you.

374
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,200
So I brought you night snacks.

375
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,279
Have some before you work.

376
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,599
Recently,

377
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,200
the company's loss has been big.

378
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,519
So we have a lot of things to deal with.

379
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't have much time for you.

380
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,200
Sorry.

381
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,799
What is this for?

382
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,000
Sending power bank outside

383
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,640
to recharge your batteries.

384
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,279
The power bank won!

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,279
What's the brand

386
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,480
the charger?

387
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,440
A special card of Mu Hurun.

388
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,920
The same brand.

389
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,799
Ten more, please.

390
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,599
Isn't one enough for you?

391
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,279
Just kidding.

392
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,079
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

393
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
If your sister comes back,

394
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,359
where will you go?

395
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,279
Of course I'm going back to study.

396
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,160
What about me?

397
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,160
This?

398
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,559
This is...

399
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,200
I just had a dream.

400
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,599
I dreamed that

401
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,599
your sister was back

402
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,880
and then you disappeared.

403
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,599
Now that you

404
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,119
answer the question now,

405
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,799
I will make my own decision then.

406
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,319
What decision?

407
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,880
It's a secret.

408
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,599
What food he took?

409
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,119
Stop staring at the phone.

410
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,279
You've lost your soul.

411
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,319
Fang, I have something to tell you.

412
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,759
What?

413
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,599
Actually, I've thought about this

414
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,640
for a long time.

415
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,759
I told you this before.

416
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,039
You said I read too many novels.

417
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,920
But after recent

418
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,799
something happened,

419
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,200
I believe my speculation.

420
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
That should be true.

421
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,039
Well, what on earth are you trying to say?

422
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,960
Little Su's temperament has changed

423
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,279
In the past few months.

424
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,279
He seems to be

425
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,759
was totally different.

426
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,559
Even if Shan and you

427
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,400
even if your reactions are slow,

428
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,880
she probably noticed something too.

429
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
So I suspect...

430
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,039
It's not that I doubt,

431
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,119
I'm sure that

432
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,880
that Xia.

433
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,960
It's been a long time.

434
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,000
You should know the truth.

435
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,839
Do you know

436
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,839
actually,

437
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,759
so Little Su

438
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,200
her soul mate.

439
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,279
Brother Fang!

440
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,319
Brother Fang!

441
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,319
And Wu Danxia.

442
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:22,839
Sometimes,

443
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,200
deeply doubted.

444
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,039
With the ball

445
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,599
on your neck

446
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,519
on the top

447
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,599
brain or not.

448
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,279
Why did you scold me?

449
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
If I didn't pass through,

450
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,799
then what happened?

451
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,880
And what do you mean

452
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
what does the truth mean?

453
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,240
The truth is...

454
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,799
You should watch the serious stuff more.

455
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,559
Brother Fang.

456
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,880
What exactly happened?

457
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,599
Stop. From now on,

458
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,279
don't tell me

459
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,160
another word to me.

460
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,640
Little Su is so beautiful.

461
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,279
I'm sure she'll be even more beautiful

462
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,640
when she's married to Mr. Mu.

463
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,200
Card.

464
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,759
See, I told you

465
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,279
we can definitely

466
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,119
with our advertisement.

467
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,519
The planning is done.

468
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,400
I will show it to you later.

469
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,960
Alright.

470
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,440
Xia Tian.

471
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,039
Mr. Mu is here.

472
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,599
Are you here to pick up Miss Su?

473
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,960
This one is done.

474
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,319
How long does she have to hold on?

475
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
It should only be

476
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,599
approximately half an hour.

477
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,319
Wasn't about this.

478
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,119
That's...

479
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,119
It's about Su Jin.

480
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,960
Things about Little Jin

481
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,039
something is happening recently.

482
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,519
It won't be long.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Mr. Mu, why do you suddenly ask this?

484
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,920
Right.

485
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:11,839
To propose to her

486
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,400
we need to get back on track.

487
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,880
Keep the proposal a secret.

488
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't worry.

489
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,359
Mr. Su, thank you for your hard work.

490
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,240
Alright. Thank you.

491
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,160
Thank you.

492
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,799
Ji Shi, I'll take it.

493
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,079
After I meet him outside,

494
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,359
you have to call me Su Jin.

495
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,400
What if someone hears you?

496
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,880
Tell me, when can I

497
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
I can tell the world

498
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,640
my girlfriend is Su Jishi.

499
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,119
Then I'll openly

500
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,119
openly and openly.

501
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,079
You don't need to call her other's name.

502
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

503
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,960
I believe my life will be

504
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,079
my life will be back

505
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,119
back on track soon.

506
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,640
As long as Xiao Jin is back,

507
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,079
she will be the actress.

508
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
I'll continue with my study.

509
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,039
It's just that I'm more worried

510
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,799
how can we explain

511
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,920
to the people around us?

512
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,680
Actually,

513
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,319
I really think that

514
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,599
now that we've come to this point,

515
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,799
we should boldly

516
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,440
and be frank to everyone.

517
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,839
Though it's a little late to come clean now,

518
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,319
but it's better than nothing.

519
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,880
Then tell me.

520
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,799
Will Aunt Hua think

521
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,839
that we lied to her,

522
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
and she wouldn't allow us

523
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,920
to our relationship.

524
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,079
What?

525
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,720
If my mom doesn't allow it,

526
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,200
you won't be with me, right?

527
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,119
How is that possible?

528
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,680
Then I'll tell Aunt Hua

529
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,960
that you are my man.

530
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,440
Even if the sky falls down,

531
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,319
I won't let go even if the sky falls down.

532
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,440
Is that

533
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,440
even if Wuzhi Mountain collapses,

534
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,359
you have to be with me.

535
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,160
Certainly.

536
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,799
But I think you actually

537
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,839
to worry so much.

538
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,400
With what I know about Xiaoman

539
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,519
and my mom,

540
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,000
they like you so much.

541
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
When they know the truth,

542
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,039
they should have accepted it at once.

543
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,559
Really

544
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,559
I have that confidence.

545
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
So the whole thing

546
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,640
the whole thing.

547
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,079
So you all know

548
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
only I don't know.

549
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,559
I'll go check on her.

550
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,359
And me.

551
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,559
I don't know either

552
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,640
this child

553
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,079
I'll go and take a look.

554
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,119
That...

555
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,440
Mother.

556
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:24,440
Mother.

557
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Aunt Hua.

558
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,440
Mother.

559
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,079
Aunt Hua.

560
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,599
Mom, what's wrong?

561
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,119
Aunt Hua.

562
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,960
Call 120. Hurry!

563
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,519
Mom!

564
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,079
Were you scared?

565
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,359
Your mom is that fragile.

566
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,599
Not really.

567
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,599
Actually,

568
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,640
I already knew about that.

569
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,319
But I don't want to say it.

570
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,920
I'd like to see when you two

571
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,240
when do you want to confess?

572
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,680
Since when have you known?

573
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,480
On the day Mr. In-laws came,

574
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,160
he told me everything.

575
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,039
My dad is really

576
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,839
It's not easy for your dad.

577
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,480
Are you still mad?

578
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,799
The two of you chose to keep it a secret.

579
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,680
You must have your reasons.

580
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,599
As her elders,

581
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,039
other than understanding you

582
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,200
and I don't give you any trouble.

583
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,359
That's good.

584
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,519
Why would I be angry?

585
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:35,880
Huron,

586
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,119
before your father died,

587
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
he was most worried about you.

588
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
He took my hands and told me

589
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,279
that I wish you can find the right girl.

590
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
You had to watch me complain all the time

591
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,160
that you wanted grandchildren.

592
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,079
Actually, I've been thinking about

593
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
that you can be happy.

594
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,559
In the past,

595
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,440
those scenes

596
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
gradually.

597
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,000
I know there's such a girl

598
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,960
to have her.

599
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,000
I've already found it out.

600
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,720
She's already

601
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,079
In love with

602
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,640
with this little punk long ago.

603
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,079
As long as the two of you

604
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,359
love each other,

605
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,160
that's enough.

606
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,920
To be happy about that.

607
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,359
Right?

608
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,759
Thank you, Aunt Hua.

609
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,960
But this is

610
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,880
this is no small matter.

611
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,200
You two

612
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,039
get back to normal life.

613
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,400
Let's not cause

614
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,640
more trouble.

615
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't worry, mom. She won't.

616
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
My son.

617
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,799
It's not easy, kids.

618
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,720
It's hard for both of you.

619
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,200
All right.

620
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,519
Don't be angry with them.

621
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,400
I was not angry with them.

622
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,720
But also you.

623
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,319
It's fine if they keep the truth from me.

624
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,960
Why did you keep it from me, too?

625
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,519
You really treat me as an outsider?

626
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,240
No one treats you as a stranger.

627
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,359
Think about it,

628
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
If I really treat you as an outsider,

629
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,960
how could I tell you the truth

630
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,160
your brother and Su Jin?

631
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,920
Yes, that's right.

632
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,359
But why did you keep it from me?

633
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,759
This is not a trivial matter.

634
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,119
Of course, someone who knows about this

635
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,160
for the fewer people to know.

636
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,759
But now, you have suddenly

637
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,240
suddenly like this?

638
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,359
My sister-in-law suddenly

639
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,319
an actress suddenly became

640
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,920
then you became a female doctor of geology.

641
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
With her name and personality.

642
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,599
She has completely changed.

643
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,960
It's too sudden.

644
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,759
Lower your voice.

645
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,799
Let's talk in the car.

646
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,519
An actress becoming a doctor.

647
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,839
That's interesting.

648
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,160
What kind of tricks?

649
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
Sit down.

650
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,920
I really cried.

651
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,039
I knew

652
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,680
little Su was so gentle.

653
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,839
How come she suddenly

654
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,480
that's for sure.

655
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,200
That's good as well.

656
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
I really like you.

657
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,640
But how can the person

658
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,400
suddenly become

659
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,079
that I don't know?

660
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,839
You'll treat me as a stranger

661
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,319
you are treating me as a stranger.

662
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,799
Certainly not.

663
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,039
I am just thinking of it.

664
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,920
We can't work together

665
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
work together in the future.

666
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,359
That we can't work together.

667
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,000
Aren't you angry?

668
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,839
Silly girl.

669
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,279
Even if we can't

670
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,480
work together in the future,

671
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,239
we can still be friends.

672
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,039
You've always said that

673
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,440
that I'm not as gentle as Xiaojin.

674
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,559
This is just right.

675
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,320
If anyone dares to bully you in the future,

676
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,440
you'd let a savage like me

677
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,400
to help you.

678
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,800
Next time, I really can come to you again.

679
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,800
Can I really see you again?

680
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,440
Of course it is.

681
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,159
I won't lie to you this time.

682
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,119
I'm fine then.

683
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,159
No more being sad.

684
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,239
Stop being sad.

685
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,119
Little Su.

686
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,679
Then can I ask you something?

687
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,159
What's that?

688
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,599
Then are you really

689
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,559
are they real or not?

690
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,280
I knew it.

691
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,519
Even this is fake too.

692
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,840
I thought I was in the front row

693
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,159
that I have eaten the sweetest candy.

694
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,119
But they turned out to be plastic.

695
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,079
That Jinxiu and her husband are a fake one.

696
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,199
But Huron and I are real.

697
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,719
So the candy you've eaten these months

698
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,079
Is real.

699
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,880
Huron is my boyfriend indeed.

700
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,320
And we really love each other.

701
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,320
Really?

702
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,679
Really.

703
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,960
What's up

704
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,840
you shouldn't call me

705
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,679
a rich couple.

706
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,920
Su Jishi, Mu Huron.

707
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,239
How are Mr. and Mrs. Mu Su?

708
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,639
How's it going, Little Su?

709
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,599
It's not really good.

710
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,719
Yes, it doesn't sound romantic.

711
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
The Suzhou embroidery couple?

712
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,760
Huron and Su

713
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,760
are not good enough either?

714
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,639
It seems I don't have to

715
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,559
to worry about you.

716
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,679
Xiaoxia is always

717
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,480
Is easy to coax.

718
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,239
I still have an ancestor.

719
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,880
What are you going to do?

720
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,079
It's good that

721
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,840
the four of us are together again.

722
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
I'll make a deal.

723
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,159
I promised to eat here.

724
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,599
This means I forgive you.

725
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,760
I am out for a date with Gao Ling

726
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,960
and get a free meal.

727
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,119
Right, Gao Ling?

728
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,000
Let's order then, Xiaoman.

729
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,320
Check if you have anything

730
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,159
that you want to eat.

731
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,159
How about I?

732
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,039
The highest mountain.

733
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,559
Mu Xiaoman,

734
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,719
mind your attitude.

735
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,960
To forgive you.

736
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,719
It's okay. I'll order the dishes.

737
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,400
Order the signature dish.

738
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,679
Hot fatty intestines,

739
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,679
pig brain, Mapo tofu.

740
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,719
Su Jishi,

741
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,480
If you want to

742
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,519
treat me to dinner?

743
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,480
She doesn't eat internal organs.

744
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,639
It's okay. We have other dishes.

745
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,280
How about carbon roasted bullfrog?

746
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,400
I won't.

747
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,519
Spicy rabbit heads.

748
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,559
This is good.

749
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,119
It's fragrant and spicy. I'm sure you'll like it.

750
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,119
There are so cute...

751
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,679
How can you eat them?

752
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,679
Xiaoman, in fact, if you

753
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,880
like this restaurant,

754
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,400
we can go to another one.

755
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,760
What do you mean?

756
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,159
I didn't admit it.

757
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,000
You are my sister-in-law.

758
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,519
I'll always admit that you're Su.

759
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,079
It's not you anyway.

760
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,280
And my brother

761
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,559
that he wanted to marry you.

762
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,480
To marry you.

763
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
Get the marriage license now.

764
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,199
Look at that.

765
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,280
Since we have

766
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
to our families,

767
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,360
and my mom likes you so much.

768
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,039
It's about time.

769
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,079
Gao Ling, look at them.

770
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,320
Let's see what's delicious.

771
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,440
It's better to leave them alone,

772
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
we should be in a good mood on our date.

773
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,920
Here you go.

774
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:11,840
Thanks.

775
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,800
Let's watch a movie later.

776
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,199
Alright, which movie would you like to watch?

777
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,960
I book tickets.

778
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,280
I can watch it with you.

779
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,840
It's your brother!

780
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,800
You answer it first.

781
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:26,960
Hello, brother.

782
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,559
Boss.

783
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,159
Come here right now.

784
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,800
But I promised to

785
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,559
to watch the movie.

786
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,920
The movie is cancelled?

787
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,480
Canceled?

788
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,000
Brother, how can you do this?

789
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,760
We are in the honeymoon phase.

790
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,559
A date.

791
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,159
Who is better than

792
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,440
Is marriage important?

793
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Marriage

794
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,559
since your sister-in-law

795
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,880
said everything yesterday,

796
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
I have to plan

797
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,719
a grand marriage proposal ceremony

798
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,719
propose?

799
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Hello, Mr. Mu.

800
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,800
These are the most high-end wedding dresses

801
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,840
we have selected for you.

802
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,679
Is limited to one piece.

803
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,400
I think this one is nice.

804
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,119
This one is awful.

805
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,679
OK. Take this one out.

806
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,679
Okay, keep it for now.

807
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,320
Didn't you say the design is bad?

808
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,920
Even the worst shape

809
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,760
she can

810
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
she can control it perfectly.

811
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,599
You think this one is nice?

812
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,599
This one

813
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,119
It seems too reserved.

814
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,599
Got it. Then withdraw this.

815
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:18,880
Keep this.

816
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,159
No matter how chic the clothes are,

817
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,159
she can still

818
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,000
she can wear

819
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,920
different feeling.

820
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,360
I really don't know

821
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,599
to pick a wedding dress

822
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,719
or to show off your girlfriend?

823
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,559
What?

824
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,239
Nothing.

825
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,599
I mean, this wedding dress

826
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,519
also looks good.

827
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,800
This one is too much.

828
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,920
The more it is,

829
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,079
the more you'll set off

830
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,599
of Miss Su.

831
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,199
Right?

832
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,719
You have improved.

833
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,119
These are

834
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,119
I know.

835
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,679
Wrap them all and leave them out.

836
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,079
Wearing heels

837
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,119
Is to wear heels.

838
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
You have to listen to me this time.

839
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,360
This is the ring.

840
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,400
That's right.

841
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,880
I want this.

842
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,320
Are you sure you want this?

843
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,199
Hold on.

844
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,679
This is a wedding ring.

845
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,559
Even if you don't choose the diamond,

846
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,719
you can't be so shabby.

847
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,079
Guess what she'll say

848
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,400
guess what she'll say.

849
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,880
Of course she would say, "Moved."

850
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,519
Generally, women

851
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,719
to diamond rings.

852
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:48,599
But she is

853
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,800
Is not an ordinary woman.

854
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,719
She would surely say that

855
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,400
diamonds are crystalline carbon minerals

856
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,119
that's emitted from a volcano.

857
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,719
Is very expensive

858
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,039
are just what the diamond dealers

859
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,119
given by the diamond dealers.

860
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,280
Also,

861
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,119
If we put the carbon

862
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,119
under high temperature and pressure

863
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:03,960
high temperature and high pressure.

864
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,239
They can also make

865
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,639
with high purity.

866
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,320
It is much more cost-effective than this one.

867
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,159
Please wrap this for me.

868
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,840
Alright.

869
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,519
You two

870
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,320
are really a couple.

871
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,400
Well, today's live-stream

872
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,840
Is coming to an end.

873
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,239
See you next time.

874
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:27,599
When is the next time?

875
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,400
Next time?

876
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,039
You'll have to ask my team.

877
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,840
Anyway, I'm very happy

878
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,199
to meet you all here.

879
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:34,840
See you later.

880
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,000
If there's no accident,

881
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,159
you will arrive in an hour.

882
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,400
Get ready.

883
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,440
Hurry up decorate your room.

884
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,360
Your room?

885
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,599
When she comes out later,

886
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,760
when she is out?

887
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:45,599
Forget it. She's here.

888
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,760
Who are you talking to?

889
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,599
You are being so mysterious.

890
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,559
Nothing. It was just an ordinary

891
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,480
an office phone.

892
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Where are we going next?

893
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,639
I won't go anywhere. Go home.

894
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:56,440
I will send you home.

895
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:57,880
Go home?

896
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,360
Not right.

897
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,559
You told me last night that I

898
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:01,679
to shoot a promotional video.

899
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
And we have to reshoot

900
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,039
some advertising materials

901
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:06,840
for many years.

902
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,679
Fang Xie,

903
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:12,000
you're acting weird.

904
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:12,599
No. No.

905
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,400
Something is wrong?

906
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,800
Are you usually like this?

907
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,719
You told Mr. Mu, right?

908
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,880
You said I was an arrogant man.

909
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,960
I cancel all those

910
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,039
and cancel the trip.

911
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,360
Little Su, don't ask me.

912
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,639
I can't tell you.

913
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,159
I won't ask you what it is.

914
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Then tell me.

915
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,800
Why can't I?
