1
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,359
Here you are.

2
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,920
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,719
It's for it.

4
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,719
It loves apples, just like you.

5
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,879
An apple a day to keep the doctor away.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Doctor Su.

7
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,000
I like apples very much.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
That's why I'm called

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,079
doctor Su.

10
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,959
It turns out the food is the same as mine.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,520
No wonder.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,280
I was just thinking that

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,879
you like me that much, don't you?

14
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,759
Just casually mentioning it.

15
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,879
I remember it so clearly.

16
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,879
I remember that

17
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,360
when you were making a circus,

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
you seemed frightened.

19
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
During the interview,

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I was a little afraid of horses.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,919
But today I felt fine.

22
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,520
I feel that you two

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
get along very well.

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,560
And I feel like you can ride a horse.

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,599
That's because I have

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,159
learning how to

27
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,439
how to get along with horses.

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
So now,

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,199
I'm not that afraid of horses.

30
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,520
You know that

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
In our industry,

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,599
If you give up

33
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,479
out of fear,

34
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,039
you'll miss many opportunities.

35
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,000
As for being like you can ride a horse,

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,439
It might be because

37
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,439
that I'm gifted

38
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,520
but his insight is remarkable.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,240
Why so many questions today?

40
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,319
To get to know you more.

41
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,639
Do you still remember

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,080
about our argument

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,479
that we had a fight.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,319
What's up

45
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,039
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,599
You're right.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
Be it for friends

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
to our relatives,

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,719
or

50
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,280
you should be honest

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,240
with the one you like.

52
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,280
Cheating won't solve anything.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
I can barely remember that.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
Sorry

55
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,520
hey.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,719
Mr. Mu.

57
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,319
It's serious.

58
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,080
Something serious has happened.

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
I'll go back first.

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,039
Gao Ling said he was in a hurry.

61
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,039
I'll leave now.

62
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,599
Practice on your own. Be careful.

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
I found out Su Jin's primary school

64
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,959
I found out her real name as well.

65
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,279
She is called Su Jinqing.

66
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,879
She has a twin sister.

67
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,160
When they were in the primary school,

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
when she was in primary school.

69
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,319
Su Jinqing was taken away by her mother

70
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:41,959
her sister stayed,

71
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,319
with my father.

72
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,360
Here's the key point.

73
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,800
Your sister's name is

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,079
su Jishi.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
You remember the Su Jishi

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,240
the name of the female doctor

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,079
that you admired for a long time?

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,639
Ji Shisu.

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,480
That's right.

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,519
In the beginning,

81
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,920
I thought it was too coincidental.

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
That's impossible.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,079
But after

84
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,600
online searches,

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
found this.

86
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,199
The blogger

87
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,560
Is a geology student

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
and a geology student.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
That's why I'm sure

90
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
the female blogger you've been admiring

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,839
Is actually the female blogger

92
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,920
the one who's with you

93
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
with you now.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,920
Whether it's to her friends

95
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
to our relatives,

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,399
or

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
you should be honest

98
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,519
with the one you like.

99
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,720
Cheating won't solve anything.

100
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,040
Miss Su,

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,279
you asked me to stay late at night

102
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,920
just to watch you

103
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,000
with the hammer?

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,000
What happened to you?

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,519
I will really leave if I don't tell you.

106
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,920
I want to

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,120
to tell Mu Heulen his true identity.

108
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,079
What did you say

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,399
no kidding?

110
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
Why are you looking at me that way?

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,079
Can it be that...

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Fall in love with Mr. Mu?

113
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,600
Who said that?

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,240
I just don't want to cheat him anymore.

115
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,040
We're now comrades in arms

116
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,439
and friends.

117
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,000
We've known each other for a long time,

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,279
he actually helped us a lot.

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,199
Rather than lying,

120
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,040
telling the truth

121
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,279
maybe he will be more willing to cooperate with us

122
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,319
he might be more willing to cooperate with us.

123
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,879
We don't need to continue acting.

124
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,600
I can only say that

125
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,079
you really don't know him well.

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you know what Mr. Mu

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,519
what Mr. Mu hates the most?

128
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,000
Is that he was lied to.

129
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,680
When Jing Qing and he

130
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
signed the agreement with him,

131
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,959
this clause is expressly

132
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,759
It's written into the contract.

133
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,360
And he warned them over and over again.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Cheating is a great sin

135
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
that could not be forgiven.

136
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,240
How come

137
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,759
after hearing this news?

138
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,480
But not excited?

139
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,720
Why should I be happy?

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,879
That you like

141
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,040
are the same

142
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
are the same person.

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Please be clear.

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,360
I have been cheated.

145
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
You asked me

146
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
lie to someone I like.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,279
That's the thing.

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Go back now.

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
I want to be alone for a while.

150
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Also,

151
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,879
I don't want to

152
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,160
know about this.

153
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,879
Don't worry.

154
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,360
Because I don't want to

155
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
to think like a pure white girl.

156
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,639
Mr. Mu,

157
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,439
sit over there.

158
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,279
I'll drive the rest.

159
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,120
My name is Su Jishi.

160
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,800
Not Su Jin.

161
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
Was all

162
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,480
a lie?

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,000
Su Jishi,

164
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,319
what's the truth about you?

165
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,800
No, I'm not.

166
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,319
Tell him and be forgiven.

167
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,399
I'll make it clear with him now

168
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,399
to understand you.

169
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,920
Goodness.

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,079
Calm down.

171
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:11,839
Don't be impulsive.

172
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,720
Calm down.

173
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,040
Come on.

174
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,319
Are you clear about the consequences?

175
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:16,959
How Mr. Mu

176
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,399
mr. Mu has towards you now?

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,120
You know?

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,399
Has he confessed his feelings to you?

179
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,560
Has he said he likes you?

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,279
I know you have feelings for Mr. Mu.

181
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,560
You must think that Mr. Mu is a good person.

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
And won't hurt you, right?

183
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,079
But you have to remember,

184
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,480
he's a man.

185
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,040
And it's also

186
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,680
who hates to be lied to

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
who lies to them.

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,159
What is the most important thing?

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
You don't even know

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
how deep his feelings for you are.

191
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,879
Right?

192
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,159
To forgive you

193
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,720
to forgive you for lying to him?

194
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
What if you change your mind?

195
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,320
Think about the consequences of breaking the contract.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,759
Think about Jinqing.

197
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,960
She worked so hard

198
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,799
her hard work

199
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,200
will all be gone.

200
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,480
Alright, got it.

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
Go back first.

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Don't worry.

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,399
I won't tell you first.

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
All right, I'm off.

205
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,919
Have an early rest

206
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,960
don't think too much.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,320
The official shooting is tomorrow.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,759
Miss Su.

209
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,399
When you lift your hair,

210
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,519
should be more beautiful.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
That's right.

212
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,759
Three, two, one.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,679
Miss Su.

214
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,840
The feeling of touching your hair is great.

215
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,639
Let's take two more photos.

216
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,039
Miss Su,

217
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,480
our cool and cool feelings.

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,120
That's enough.

219
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,480
The tender and sexy side.

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,279
But I couldn't get it out.

221
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,559
Shall we try again?

222
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:13,919
Alright.

223
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,759
Relax your eyes.

224
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:15,799
OK.

225
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,559
Nice.

226
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,120
Another one.

227
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,000
Take the flower off and try again.

228
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,480
Mr Su,

229
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
let's try to find the feeling.

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Your expression is a little fierce.

231
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,440
Don't force your eyes.

232
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,120
Your head is too low.

233
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,679
Miss Su.

234
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
Why don't you take a rest

235
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,000
and try to get in the right condition.

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,039
We can shoot later.

237
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,960
Why not?

238
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,960
It's so cold.

239
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,440
On the horse in such a cold day.

240
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,879
What if he's sick?

241
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,679
What brought you here?

242
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,759
I just came to have a look.

243
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Linda Hu is very

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,600
very beautiful today.

245
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,320
You too.

246
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,480
Take photos quickly.

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,399
Miss Su is shy.

248
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,039
Right.

249
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,799
That's the feeling.

250
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,759
Sexy with gentleness.

251
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Got it.

252
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,759
It's pretty.

253
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,440
That's pretty good, Miss Su.

254
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,639
Thank you for your coat.

255
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,039
Your look today is really special.

256
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,720
You look totally different from before.

257
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,159
To break yourself.

258
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,879
It fits you well.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Why not?

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,159
It has no skin today.

261
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,000
It's such a good cat.

262
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,559
Linda, thank you.

263
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,960
Su Jishi.

264
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,480
Who's that?

265
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,480
A female doctor in geology.

266
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,240
I read a paper of her before.

267
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,480
And very talented.

268
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,000
No.

269
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,559
That horse is so handsome.

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,879
He knows Su Jishi

271
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,440
did he just tell it to me?

272
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,000
Did he find out something?

273
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,320
I heard from Head Zhang that

274
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,879
that Dr. Su

275
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,720
Is to study Mount Taal

276
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
It turns out

277
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,720
we suddenly encountered a volcanic eruption.

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,919
So I had to postpone graduation.

279
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,759
This year,

280
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,360
was to enter

281
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,559
of the Zhang Academy

282
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,600
to Qinghai for research.

283
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,720
To my surprise,

284
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,279
before the project started,

285
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,559
and there was a big earthquake there.

286
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,279
For a few months.

287
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,919
To me.

288
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,240
What troubles me.

289
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,600
What the hell does that mean?

290
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,159
She is really out of luck.

291
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,519
I'm actually looking forward to

292
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,759
when exactly

293
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,039
meet her once?

294
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,960
No, Mu Huron.

295
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,480
Why are you talking about these?

296
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,759
I cannot understand

297
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,039
well, in the past few months,

298
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,840
you seem to be very interested

299
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
geology all the time.

300
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,279
I thought you would like to hear this.

301
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
My interest has always

302
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,639
Is broad and diverse.

303
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Don't worry.

304
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,440
Nothing to tell me

305
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
to tell me?

306
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,360
Nothing.

307
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,159
Alright.

308
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,679
Mu Huron.

309
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,840
Think about the consequences of violating the contract.

310
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,279
Think about Jinqing.

311
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,480
Don't mention it.

312
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,039
Just thank you

313
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,519
for lending me Linda today.

314
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,879
It suddenly occurred to me that

315
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,840
that our company

316
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,279
binnan University organized

317
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,879
about geology recently

318
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
the time is the day after tomorrow.

319
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,879
Are you interested?

320
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,120
Is it the 10th Geological Environment

321
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,159
the 10th Geo-Environmental Resources Forum?

322
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,000
But that requires an invitation.

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,600
An invitation.

324
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,120
I read it in the moments

325
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
on his WeChat Moments.

326
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,279
Certainly,

327
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,879
If you really have no company

328
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,440
the day after tomorrow?

329
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,399
I probably

330
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,679
because I don't have a schedule.

331
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,639
To keep you company.

332
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,639
Alright.

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,399
I'll pick you up then.

334
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,279
See you the day after tomorrow.

335
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
That was close.

336
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,799
I think he's acting weird today.

337
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,120
I can see

338
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
your participation in this event

339
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,879
very happy.

340
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,759
Of course I'm happy when I don't have to work.

341
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,399
Having nothing else to do?

342
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,440
Actually, I quite like to

343
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
walking around the campus

344
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,720
and I see the students

345
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,159
when I see them,

346
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,159
your mood will become much better.

347
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,799
I always

348
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,360
It seems that I'm

349
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,120
playing a certain role.

350
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,639
She put on an act with Second Uncle in the company.

351
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
For the company's assets.

352
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,960
To smooth my relationship in front of my mom

353
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,159
to make her happy.

354
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,320
Only here,

355
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
to be myself

356
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,799
and be myself.

357
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,440
I also miss the campus life.

358
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,559
Although sometimes

359
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,639
study can be complicated,

360
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,519
however,

361
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,679
compared to being an entertainer or an actor,

362
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,279
the life back then was

363
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,399
was simple and pure.

364
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,759
If you don't like it,

365
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
why would I be an actor?

366
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:16,919
In spite of oneself

367
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,759
was forced into it.

368
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,559
Can you tell me

369
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,399
the real reason?

370
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
You know that, right?

371
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Back then, my mother was seriously ill.

372
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,320
I had to save up money for her treatment.

373
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,080
So I have to

374
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,840
If you don't like

375
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,440
that your current life.

376
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Your current life.

377
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,120
As long as you tell me the truth.

378
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,759
I'll keep my words.

379
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,639
Do you know what Mr. Mu

380
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,360
what Mr. Mu hates the most?

381
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,639
Is that he was lied to.

382
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,080
Think about Jinqing.

383
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,240
She worked so hard

384
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,960
her hard work

385
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
will all be wasted.

386
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,159
This is the path I've chosen.

387
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,840
I'll make it no matter how hard it is.

388
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,600
Enough. Let's not talk about unpleasant things.

389
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,919
Since...

390
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,559
You like campus life so much,

391
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,399
then I will try it with you

392
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,360
to experience

393
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
school couples usually

394
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,720
hold hands like this.

395
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,640
Just go.

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,519
I meant what I said just now.

397
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,720
If...

398
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,240
Hey.

399
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,079
What?

400
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,480
Professor is here

401
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,839
to attend this seminar.

402
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,920
Hello, Mr. Mu.

403
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
I'm really sorry.

404
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,279
Today, a big director suddenly

405
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,920
asked Miss Su to discuss the project.

406
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,319
I picked her up.

407
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,400
Oh, right!

408
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
We're already on our way.

409
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
Goodbye, Mr. Mu.

410
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,880
What did he say?

411
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
He said nothing.

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,119
I just said that I know.

413
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,799
Come on, Great Madam.

414
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,119
What's wrong with you?

415
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,559
Came to the forum

416
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,920
cheerfully.

417
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,559
And suddenly called me

418
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,000
to pick you up again.

419
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,160
I checked the forum today.

420
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,680
I found that a professor in our university

421
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,359
are also here.

422
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,119
I'd escape if I found it earlier.

423
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,599
Maybe I'll expose myself today.

424
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,319
You can come up with a lie

425
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,200
and tell Mr. Mu about this.

426
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
To him?

427
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,519
Why must I

428
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,880
I have to call him?

429
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,400
I've made up so many lies.

430
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,359
Although I can't

431
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,680
tell him the truth now,

432
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:01,920
but I don't want to

433
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,279
to lie to him again.

434
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,799
Lying to him won't be called lying.

435
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,359
Let me see if I have

436
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,720
the geological hammer.

437
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm sorry, sis.

438
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,759
What happened?

439
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,319
How can you drink when you can't touch alcohol?

440
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,240
I don't need to drown my sorrows.

441
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm just relieved.

442
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,359
I thought I'd be dragged

443
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,559
drag a drunk back today.

444
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,039
A glass of whisky.

445
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
Are you still angry?

446
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,599
Shouldn't I be angry?

447
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:23,960
You should be...

448
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,599
You should be angry

449
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,200
you should hit them

450
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,000
and expose

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,319
their plots and schemes,

452
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,319
and ask them to take up

453
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,599
to pay the penalty for breach of contract

454
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,319
to pay the penalty.

455
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
How dare they deceive us?

456
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,279
How could a innocent man like her

457
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,319
a man's relationship

458
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,920
he's so sinful!

459
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,480
To check your pulse?

460
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,160
What pulse?

461
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,319
Come on.

462
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,960
Are you having

463
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,960
with complicated feelings.

464
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,799
You should be angry.

465
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,000
But whenever I see her,

466
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,079
all chi

467
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,759
Is gone.

468
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,920
Whenever I think of her,

469
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
look at your old face.

470
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,920
Handsome face

471
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,079
that couldn't be suppressed

472
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,920
when you see me.

473
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
It seems that

474
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I've fallen in love with you.

475
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,359
And the symptoms right?

476
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,279
I'm not.

477
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,640
My friend.

478
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,759
You have an incurable disease

479
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,400
to love

480
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,359
with no cure.

481
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,039
Sorry for your loss.

482
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,559
By the way,

483
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,599
when did you

484
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,079
you fell in love with her?

485
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,720
Can you tell if you love Su Jin

486
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,799
and you prefer Su Jishi?

487
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,359
I'm not stupid.

488
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:56,759
So have you figured out

489
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,720
the next step?

490
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,039
Don't answer it.

491
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,279
Is the forum over?

492
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,559
I'm sorry,

493
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,039
where are you now?

494
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,960
Mr. Su is my best student.

495
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,279
Ask her what it is.

496
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,359
What's important?

497
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,079
If there is

498
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,039
Important thing to do,

499
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll switch it to my boss.

500
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Nothing.

501
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
I just wanted to ask him

502
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,160
If he wants to go out for night snacks.

503
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,400
Not if he's busy.

504
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,960
Thank you, Gao Ling. Goodbye.

505
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:00,799
Alright.

506
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,839
She hung up.

507
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,039
She said nothing

508
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,279
she wants to treat you to night snacks.

509
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,359
If you are so reluctant,

510
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,880
you should just tell her how you feel.

511
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,799
Just tell her

512
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,359
you already know.

513
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,960
Is Xiaoman not feeling well today?

514
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,000
She was still alive and kicking this morning.

515
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What's up

516
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,200
nothing.

517
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,240
Leave if you have something to do.

518
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,799
I don't need your company. It's fine.

519
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,359
Alright.

520
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,759
After all,

521
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,440
It's hard to get drunk after drinking milk beer.

522
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
The hero is sad for the beauty.

523
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
Xiaoman.

524
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,359
Xiaoman.

525
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,920
Gao Ling, you're here.

526
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,799
It's not locked. Come in.

527
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,240
I knew it.

528
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,200
You won't leave me alone.

529
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,160
How do you feel?

530
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,920
I feel sick.

531
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,480
Sorry.

532
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,519
Your brother told me that

533
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,519
you looked so lively.

534
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
I thought you were kidding.

535
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,839
About a girl.

536
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,279
My brother knows nothing.

537
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,599
Just lie down properly.

538
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,039
I'll make you some brown sugar water.

539
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,039
Come on.

540
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,839
Put this on your stomach.

541
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,799
Drink the water.

542
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,240
I have no strength.

543
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,799
Why are you so sick?

544
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,400
I don't have the strength.

545
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,839
Here, hold this.

546
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,599
Come on. Stand up.

547
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,720
Come on. Drink the water.

548
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,400
It's hot.

549
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,039
Blow it.

550
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Do you feel better now?

551
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,680
Let me get you some medicine.

552
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,680
Brother Gao Ling.

553
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,079
I don't want to take the medicine.

554
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,839
It's bad for your health.

555
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,480
It's better than you taking it.

556
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,759
I really don't want to take any medicine.

557
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,160
Brother Gao Ling.

558
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,799
What can I do for you?

559
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,119
You didn't have to do anything

560
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,079
just stay by my side.

561
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,599
Chapter 6

562
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,839
The Little Prince

563
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,279
that's it.

564
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,440
I began to understand

565
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,559
of your melancholy life.

566
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,079
For a very long time,

567
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,680
that your only fun

568
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
sorry, sorry.

569
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,079
Your nose was smashed.

570
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,119
Take responsibility for the damage.

571
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
- Oh, no! - I think I bumped my nose.

572
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,759
Really?

573
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,519
Let me have a look.

574
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Is it crooked?

575
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,880
Let me have a look.

576
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,400
It is a little crooked.

577
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,200
I think you're not that seriously ill.

578
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,799
I'll go back first.

579
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,000
Sleep early.

580
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,720
Gao Ling, don't go.

581
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,079
Gao Ling, I won't give up.

582
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,160
If I don't win you,

583
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,359
then I won't call her Mu Xiaoman.

584
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,000
The portrait of Su Jin who breaks the convention

585
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
these pictures are sold out once released.

586
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,079
Su Jin changed her image.

587
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,079
She has a breakthrough

588
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,640
the sales of our magazine have reached a new high.

589
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,599
Little Su.

590
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,599
Why are you holding your phone?

591
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,480
Cultivating relationships with phones

592
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,160
people feel refreshed when they're celebrating.

593
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,680
As of yesterday,

594
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,839
the total sales volume of this issue

595
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,680
of ZhenYi magazine online and offline

596
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,160
reached 880,000.

597
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,839
Which has directly hit

598
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,359
In the past five years.

599
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,839
What are you doing, Miss Su?

600
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,960
Carry out photosynthesis.

601
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,720
And fight against depression.

602
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,400
What's wrong with her?

603
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,400
I don't know.

604
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,839
She's been like this these two days.

605
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,519
And she didn't say anything about what happened.

606
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,519
The magazine sent us

607
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,759
electronic subscription list.

608
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,279
Of the first place has ordered 5,000 copies.

609
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Mr. Mu, isn't this Mr. Hu?

610
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,039
Let me have a look.

611
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,720
Alright.

612
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,079
This project will proceed

613
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,720
proceed as planned.

614
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
If there is any problem,

615
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,359
and communicate with them.

616
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

617
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,079
We are...

618
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,559
What's going on?

619
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,400
Everyone.

620
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,880
I have something personal with Huron.

621
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
Please give me five minutes.

622
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,119
Please go away.

623
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,119
Please leave.

624
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,480
She got more and more

625
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,400
became more and more out of control.

626
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,599
What about Mu's image?

627
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,119
What does it have to do with Mu's clan?

628
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,119
Isn't Su Jin

629
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,279
Is your girlfriend.

630
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
Her image

631
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
will affect your image.

632
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,359
You represent Mu's Clan?

633
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,000
Second Uncle, this isn't the time.

634
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,640
No one would attack Mu's clan

635
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
for this.

636
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
Please don't worry about it.

637
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,640
What if you really can't find them?

638
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,440
You can choose not to.

639
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,920
You're the elder,

640
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,799
you should know more about

641
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,480
more than I do.

642
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,680
Second Uncle,

643
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,480
Is experienced.

644
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,839
Let me teach you.

645
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes

646
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,960
a man should be hot-blooded.

647
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,960
If he can't even

648
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
his woman,

649
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,920
how can you manage it all?

650
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,519
The entire Mu Clan?

651
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,519
Maybe I'm really stupid.

652
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,000
I really can't

653
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,200
what you're doing, Second Uncle.

654
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,680
But I have a different opinion

655
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,839
a different opinion.

656
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,559
Although Su Jin is my girlfriend,

657
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,119
she is an independent person.

658
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,799
And she's an adult

659
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,759
with civil capacity.

660
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,599
She has her own career

661
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,559
and her choice.

662
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,400
As long as it doesn't break the law,

663
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,559
no one is allowed

664
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,440
to interfere in her.

665
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,079
What's more,

666
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,359
suppress and control women

667
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,279
can you really show

668
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,440
the courage of a man?

669
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,200
What do you mean?

670
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,359
Literally.

671
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,200
If this thing

672
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
gets out of control again,

673
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,240
what will sister-in-law do when she knows?

674
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,160
Second Uncle, you may not know.

675
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,599
My mom just called me

676
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,279
she said she likes this magazine very much

677
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
and asked me to buy more.

678
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
For your friends and relatives?

679
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
But I warn you,

680
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,480
If she causes

681
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
affected Mu Family,

682
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
she can spoil you.

683
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,960
I will...

684
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,839
I won't.

685
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,279
Miss Su Jin.

686
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,559
This issue of Zhen Me magazine

687
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,759
the online and offline sales

688
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,000
reached 880,000.

689
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,119
What do you think

690
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,759
on this result?

691
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
That was expected, right?

692
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,559
To those comments that

693
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,319
about your attempts to break through yourself,

694
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,200
what do you think?

695
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,799
I'll do my own way.

696
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,599
They are free

697
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,759
to judge them.

698
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I can only say that

699
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,319
that I don't care.

700
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,200
After this issue of the magazine is launched,

701
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
many people said

702
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,160
a normal boyfriend

703
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,880
won't allow

704
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,160
your girlfriend to wear such a fancy dress.

705
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,759
They speculated that

706
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,839
you and Mr. Mu are a fake couple.

707
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,319
What do you think of this?

708
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,240
I think that

709
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,480
If a man

710
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,559
must mind the clothes

711
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,880
what his girlfriend wears,

712
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,720
you won't be able to

713
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,079
he's a normal person.

714
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,839
But for girls

715
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,119
who has such a boyfriend,

716
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,720
I only have one suggestion as well.

717
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,279
Run quickly.

718
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,000
Please show up

719
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,840
show up.

720
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,239
The countdown begins.

721
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,800
Please explain in detail.

722
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,880
How did you know I bought this?

723
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,039
You're my boss,

724
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,480
but you're also my brother.

725
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,440
I can't watch you

726
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
these days.

727
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,199
Think about it.

728
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,159
She is also

729
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,159
who has always stood firm

730
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,599
you have been giving her the cold shoulder,

731
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,320
and shunning her,

732
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,199
what will happen?

733
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,280
If I don't hold you accountable,

734
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,760
she'll completely break with you.

735
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
What would you do?

736
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,360
Listen to me.

737
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,119
Have you really fallen in love with her?

738
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,639
Admit your defeat then.

739
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,199
I'll reimburse you double the money for the magazine.

740
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Thank you, Boss.

741
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,119
The landlady is very satisfied too.

742
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
This is the internal statistics of the magazine.

743
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,239
My boyfriend purchased

744
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,639
of my boyfriend's purchase.

745
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,119
In fact, he has always

746
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,559
and support

747
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,440
and support.

748
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,280
This time we're shooting

749
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,079
was with his support

750
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,400
and his help.

751
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,920
And one week of paid vacation,

752
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,440
apply for hotel and air tickets.

753
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,960
Do you really start tomorrow?

754
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,079
Don't push your luck.

755
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,159
Just kidding.

756
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,320
What should you do next?

757
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,599
Wanted to show his hand

758
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,119
I thought about it.

759
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,639
If she didn't say it,

760
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,280
she has her reason

761
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
and her hardship.

762
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,519
It could be that

763
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,559
doesn't trust me enough.

764
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,760
I respect her.

765
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
What we have to do now

766
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,039
Is to protect

767
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,559
to keep this a secret for her.

768
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
But won't you be curious

769
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,559
where Su Jinqing is?

770
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,559
Why did they exchange their identities

771
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,719
why did they exchange their identities?

772
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,039
Will you be scared?

773
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,320
That one day Su Jishi

774
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,719
suddenly become Su Dinqing?

775
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,119
Of course, I'm scared.

776
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,079
So I need to see

777
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,360
before she turns back,

778
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,519
trap her.

779
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,239
Powerful.

780
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,199
Reimbursed? Don't forget it.

781
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,760
I... I'll fight for you!

782
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,800
There's an argument, sis.

783
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,519
Nothing.

784
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,199
You have worked hard today.

785
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,199
You've worked hard.

786
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,719
It's much more tiring

787
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,519
than leaving the field for months.

788
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
No wonder Qin Qing couldn't run anymore.

789
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,000
It's nothing.

790
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,159
Mr. Mu really respects you.

791
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,639
And cares about you a lot.

792
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
Although Su Jin is my girlfriend,

793
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
she's an independent person.

794
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,000
And she's

795
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,159
he's an adult

796
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,159
having the legal capacity.

797
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,039
She has her own choices

798
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,119
and her career.

799
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,800
As long as the law is not involved,

800
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
no one is allowed

801
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,599
to interfere with her.

802
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,760
Sister, you're awake.

803
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,039
Mr. Mu came here just now

804
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,239
and gave you something.

805
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,360
Where's he?

806
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,880
He left for about half an hour.

807
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:37,639
Fang Xie,

808
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,039
take me home to get changed.

809
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
And I need to

810
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,360
to tell you something important.

811
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,679
You have to tell them.

812
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:48,880
I have to.

813
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,800
If...

814
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,719
There's no "if."

815
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,559
Whether it's for friends,

816
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,960
to your family,

817
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,960
you should be honest

818
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,119
with the one you like.

819
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,119
Deception cannot solve anything.

820
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,920
My heart and my judgment.

821
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,760
I can't be wrong.

822
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,480
I believe him.

823
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,719
I've asked him to

824
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,639
at the theme park at 9 p.m.

825
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,880
Alright. Good luck.

826
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,840
Mu Hulun, I believe in you

827
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,440
and us.

828
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,519
Jinqing already has someone she likes.

829
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,000
The agreement.

830
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,800
So,

831
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,840
the one Jinqing likes is Mu Hurun.

832
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,639
Su Jishi.

833
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,840
You can't have thoughts

834
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,639
someone you like.

835
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,280
Which screenwriter wrote me the story?

836
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,360
Believe it or not, I'll hit the hammer...

837
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,079
He'll be beheaded with the hammer.

838
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,039
My Little Su.

839
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,440
You finally answer the phone.

840
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,840
He is going to attend a meeting event

841
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,480
the Mystery Note event this afternoon.

842
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,360
Do you remember?

843
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,599
Pick me up when it's time.

844
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,440
Stop calling.

845
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
Give me some peace.

846
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,960
Hey, hey!

847
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,639
Boss.

848
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,440
Secretary Gao,

849
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:27,639
If a

850
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,880
a strategic partner

851
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
Invite my representative to have dinner with you.

852
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
We attach great importance to your proposal.

853
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,599
And prepared a lot.

854
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,639
And readily accepted the offer,

855
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,320
the other person suddenly

856
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,559
cancel the appointment suddenly.

857
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:37,960
Do you think

858
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,000
under normal circumstances,

859
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,239
what should they do?

860
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,760
It's a strategic partner

861
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,679
strategic partner,

862
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,159
according to normal business procedure,

863
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,280
they will apologize

864
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,559
then explain the reasons in detail.

865
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,519
And the best

866
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,159
the best solution.

867
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,800
Finally,

868
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,679
agree as soon as possible.

869
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,400
To the next meeting ASAP.

870
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,079
That's right.

871
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,639
That is the normal process.

872
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:53,960
But Mr. Mu,

873
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,000
usually,

874
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,840
doesn't usually include

875
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,159
doesn't include the girlfriend category.

876
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,719
Miss Su stood you up last time.

877
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,360
We still can't contact you

878
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,280
hasn't contacted you.

879
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,280
Is she good with words?

880
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,440
Her request was canceled for some reason.

881
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,159
Alright.

882
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,760
What if it's something else?

883
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,800
I can help you.

884
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,199
But in terms of relationships,

885
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,840
I shouldn't help.

886
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,039
Oh, right.

887
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,079
Last time, you asked me to investigate

888
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,960
the whereabouts of Su Dianqing.

889
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,719
I'm searching for her.

890
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,760
I will let you know

891
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,679
when I have new news.

892
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,519
Thank you.

893
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,320
Any other arrangements for today?

894
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,239
This afternoon, I'll attend the meeting

895
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,199
mystery Note in the afternoon.

896
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,119
Su Jishi's movie.

897
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,440
Will you be there?

898
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:29,360
In that case,

899
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,960
you want to keep a low profile,

900
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,159
walk the red carpet separately

901
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,320
or with Miss Su

902
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,280
with Miss Su?

903
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,599
Call Fang Fang back.

904
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,400
I've been very busy with work.

905
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,519
Be there or not?

906
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,280
I'll think about it and give him a reply later.

907
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,199
Alright.

908
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,880
Stop pressing.

909
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,039
I know there's an activity.

910
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:06,679
I'm downstairs

911
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,880
the stairs.

912
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,679
Qianyou, hurry up, right?

913
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,199
There is an explosion over there.

914
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,039
