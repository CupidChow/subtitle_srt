1
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,200
You told Mr. Mu, right?

2
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,359
You said I was an arrogant man.

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,439
I cancel all those

4
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,519
and cancel the trip.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,680
Little Su, don't ask me.

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,959
I can't tell you.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Alright.

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,439
I won't ask you what it is.

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,719
Then tell me.

10
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,120
Why can't I?

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,959
Because if I tell you,

12
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,159
you wouldn't be surprised?

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,439
It turns out that someone

14
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,439
to make a surprise for me today.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's enough.

16
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,840
For everything.

17
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,520
Tell you everything?

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
You're so straightforward

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,919
and a one-track mind?

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,000
You can't hide anything.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
Let's go home and take a look.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
What surprise

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,800
mr. Mu made for me on earth?

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
But I'm really fine.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,319
You are nothing.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
My sister-in-law won't be able to

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,960
follow this arrow

28
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,800
to find the wedding dress and shoes

29
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,599
then my brother

30
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,919
took the ring out

31
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,840
out with the ring

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,800
kneel down and propose. Perfect.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Hey,

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,719
Is it too obvious

35
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,039
a little too obvious?

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,919
Kind of.

37
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,280
Right.

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Is too easy to find.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
My sister-in-law must think

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,719
It's not challenging.

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,479
Or put it in the dressing room?

42
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,599
No. No.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Put it in the dressing room.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,919
What if she can't find it?

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,599
Hurry up.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Your brother

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,919
to hate to marry him.

48
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,879
He didn't want to waste even a second.

49
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,360
You two, look at me.

50
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,400
What?

51
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,319
How is it? Is it OK?

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
Brother, I've already asked you

53
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,120
for the first time

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
for a hundred and one times.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
Hurry up!

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
She will be there soon.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
It's too late.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,919
Be careful

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,599
you're so anxious they're getting married?

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
I didn't know

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,599
forgive her sister-in-law?

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Mu,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,759
all the information you requested

64
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,360
are all here.

65
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,759
I've checked it.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Su Jin's alias

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
Instead of Su Ji Shi.

68
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,520
Su Jishi is her

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,479
her twin sister?

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,479
She has been studying in S Country before

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
a doctor of geology.

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Doctor of Geology?

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,360
According to investigation, she returned to China

74
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
three months ago.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,439
Which is the period

76
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,919
changed drastically.

77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
A Doctor of Geology

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
In my opinion,

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
as an actress.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,639
So interested in

81
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,680
In a company's mineral resources?

82
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,360
And knows everything.

83
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,240
Change someone.

84
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,199
It's working now.

85
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,720
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,519
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
It's none of your business.

88
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,040
You've done well.

89
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,959
The money will be credited to your account tonight.

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
But you must remember this.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
About tonight...

92
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,759
Knows what happened tonight.

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
You know

94
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,759
don't worry.

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,560
OK.

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,480
I'll leave now.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,519
You can call me

98
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,279
If anything happens.

99
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,959
Dear, what are you looking at?

100
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,800
You were so engrossed in it.

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,439
The company's files

102
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,399
none of your business.

103
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,319
You still hide them?

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,560
You and I still have secrets.

105
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,600
Tonight?

106
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,079
I have an important meeting.

107
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,439
Not eat with you?

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Not with me again?

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
My brother

110
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,360
they are so happy.

111
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,439
Do you have any

112
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,480
other thoughts about us?

113
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
What is it?

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,759
Bro, it's for Second Uncle.

115
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,240
Put it there first.

116
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,319
What did you just say?

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,800
Nothing.

118
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's hurry to decorate.

119
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,279
Mr. Fang, I'm so nervous.

120
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,279
You're not the one to surprise me.

121
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,160
Why are you nervous?

122
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm nervous for Little Su.

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,759
Do you think Little Su will be nervous?

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,519
Don't panic.

125
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,480
We are all familiar

126
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
grand scenes.

127
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,839
I'll start taking photos

128
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,600
taking photos.

129
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,439
I'll open the door.

130
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:06,959
Alright.

131
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,680
Xiao Xia.

132
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,399
Please check

133
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,199
how my makeup is now.

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,720
Should I freshen

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,439
my lipstick again?

136
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,959
Very good. Perfect.

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Really?

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Come on.

139
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Open the door!

140
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,720
It's a surprise!

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,519
Where is she?

142
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,120
I thought you said it would be a surprise.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,040
Didn't Mr. Mu say that he would

144
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,519
to propose to Little Su today?

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,079
Mr. Mu isn't the kind of guy

146
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,240
to drop the ball halfway.

147
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,560
But I heard that many people

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,639
have pre-marital phobias.

149
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,439
This kind of last-minute change

150
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,600
changed at the last minute.

151
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

152
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,480
If you think Little Su

153
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
I believe that Little Su is capable of such things.

154
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,519
Mr. Mu isn't that guy.

155
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:48,879
Little Su.

156
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,439
I was just saying nonsense.

157
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,120
Don't take it seriously.

158
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
I didn't care about it.

159
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,319
Why do you care about it so much?

160
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,639
Alright. It's late.

161
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
Go back and have some rest.

162
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,079
I really logged the whole day.

163
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm so tired.

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,759
Hurry up.

165
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,680
Get out of here.

166
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,639
Call us

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,560
give us a call.

168
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
-Bye. -Do you go now?

169
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,399
- Take care. - Bye.

170
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,439
But how can I suddenly

171
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,279
how am I supposed to accept this all of a sudden?

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,000
My sister-in-law

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,279
from an actress,

174
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,040
who is a female doctor in geology,

175
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,240
with her name and personality.

176
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,639
She has completely changed.

177
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,800
It's too sudden.

178
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,759
Lower your voice.

179
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
Let's talk in the car.

180
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,839
What does it mean?

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
Second Uncle.

182
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
You also know that

183
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
xiaoman is a novelist.

184
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,800
Her ideas have always been wild.

185
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,959
Maybe the story

186
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,480
Is the material of her novel?

187
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,879
Second Uncle, you're...

188
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
To record that?

189
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,079
I've got a lot of free time recently.

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
You deserve to be the president of Mu's Group.

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
You're indeed a good talker.

192
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,480
Alright.

193
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,399
Then help me explain

194
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
whose material

195
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,959
whose materials are these?

196
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,000
What a steal.

197
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,399
I was just an actress.

198
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,679
How could she know

199
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,240
about our mining project?

200
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
And she also has

201
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,879
a doctor of geology?

202
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
I underestimated her.

203
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,679
If I release these things

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,279
on the Internet,

205
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,919
will it blow up?

206
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,799
Fooling the audience

207
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,200
It is enough to ruin

208
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,480
a small actor.

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,440
Let's talk about it.

210
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Since you took the stuff,

211
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,519
they came to me first,

212
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,960
not the media.

213
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,120
This means

214
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,600
you don't want to destroy Su Jin

215
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,759
or the group.

216
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,000
What I want is simple.

217
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,080
Vacate Mu's position

218
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,039
the president of Mu Group,

219
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,919
give up all your shares

220
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,360
have you got a big appetite?

221
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,120
You have three days.

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
If you can't do that,

223
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,639
I'll do it for you.

224
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,200
Gao Ling consult the accountants in private.

225
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,159
Check Second Uncle.

226
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,480
You want to check his accounts?

227
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,399
Make a guess.

228
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,879
You're tired today.

229
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,840
Finally, knock off.

230
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,600
Where's my phone?

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,200
She's with me.

232
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,639
Has anyone called?

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,639
No one.

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,200
From last night till now,

235
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
mr. Mu hasn't called

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,879
every time.

237
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,799
Is he right?

238
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,519
He really regrets it?

239
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
This is too strange.

240
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,559
He only speaks nonsense everyday.

241
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,200
Boss has been so strange these days.

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,320
In the office the whole time.

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,360
Since she opened the door.

244
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Secretary Gao is inside too.

245
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,639
Something serious

246
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,720
something big is going to happen?

247
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Is there a financial crisis?

248
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Hello, sister-in-law.

249
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,039
Are you in the office?

250
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,159
Yes, I am.

251
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,559
Is your brother at his office?

252
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,759
He's here too.

253
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,399
Xiaoman.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,039
I hope you can tell me the truth.

255
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,279
Is there anything wrong with your brother?

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,159
It's impossible.

257
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Xiaoqin, why do you ask this?

258
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
My brother is an adult.

259
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,919
He's an adult.

260
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,600
He didn't come out last night

261
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,799
and up to now,

262
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,600
you haven't replied to my messages

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
for a day and a night.

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,039
He didn't even call her.

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
Gao Ling told me that his company

266
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,399
has received several big projects recently.

267
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,960
So, he was probably a little busy.

268
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,279
You know that

269
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,559
he is a workaholic.

270
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,159
He never had day or night

271
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,279
there's no day or night.

272
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,240
Xiaoman.

273
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
I hope you don't hide it from me.

274
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,000
No matter what happens,

275
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,039
I hope

276
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,200
you can face it with your brother.

277
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,639
Sister-in-law, let me be honest with you.

278
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,240
If he really had an accident,

279
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,519
and it's very serious.

280
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,919
I was so worried.

281
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,639
Wait, what exactly happened?

282
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,399
You've been busy today.

283
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's go home.

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Why are you here?

285
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,000
Sent you a message.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,159
They all fail.

287
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,559
So I had to come over.

288
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,360
I haven't seen you for only two days,

289
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,240
you've turned into a wild man.

290
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,639
What savage?

291
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,759
Touch your stubble.

292
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,360
It hurts so much.

293
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,559
You are the worst!

294
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,200
What?

295
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
My stubble can affect you

296
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,320
your image

297
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
In your heart.

298
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,960
No, that's not good.

299
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you tired?

300
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,200
It wasn't at first.

301
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,600
Now I feel tired

302
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
after you came here.

303
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,720
Let me massage you something.

304
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,960
Xiaoman has told me everything.

305
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
Sorry.

306
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
I dragged you into this.

307
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,320
What do you care about that?

308
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
It's about the agreement

309
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,679
the agreement between Su Jin and me.

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,039
With the agreement.

311
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,679
Can we not talk about this?

312
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,559
I'll keep you company.

313
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,360
Alright.

314
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,519
Look at this.

315
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,600
Found it.

316
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,120
I sent it to you. Did you see it?

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,559
Alright.

318
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,320
He's in bad debt now.

319
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,519
He doesn't dare to threaten you again.

320
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
No matter what,

321
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,639
part of the reason why he did it

322
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,679
was for the company.

323
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,279
That's it for now.

324
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,240
Alright.

325
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,960
Would you like to have breakfast?

326
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,919
How about we watch the sunrise?

327
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,399
Honey?

328
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,759
I just shot all night,

329
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
and you asked me to come here.

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,039
It's only 7 a.m.

331
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,919
So early?

332
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,440
So early in the morning?

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,559
You know what I'm thinking?

334
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,759
I'm thinking that

335
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,080
you have to follow me.

336
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,440
Because

337
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,600
I will give you a foothold

338
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,200
In the entertainment industry.

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,799
Why?

340
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,240
Why?

341
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
From tomorrow on,

342
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
I will be

343
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,600
the group's new president.

344
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,759
Really?

345
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,960
What about Mu Hurun?

346
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,240
It has nothing to do with him anymore.

347
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,879
How come you like him?

348
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,039
That's impossible.

349
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm your sweetheart.

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,759
That's me.

351
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,759
Envy Su Jin sometimes.

352
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,480
Mr. Mu worked very hard

353
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
to her back then.

354
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,960
Yadan.

355
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,159
Keep this in mind.

356
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,320
You are my girl

357
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,799
don't envy anyone.

358
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,279
If Su Jin has it,

359
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,159
you will have

360
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,200
then...

361
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,039
What about my new movie?

362
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,639
Your new play?

363
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,000
Secretary Gao,

364
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,639
the resignation letter of Xiaolan.

365
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,519
Resignation letter?

366
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,319
Mr. Mu,

367
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,359
we have found

368
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,079
we have a big financial problem.

369
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,680
I've sent you the relevant evidence

370
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
the relevant evidence to your email.

371
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,559
Oh, right.

372
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,240
Mr. Mu asked me to tell you something.

373
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,759
The day he resigned

374
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,880
Is the day you go to jail.

375
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
Think it over.

376
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,680
I'll hang up now.

377
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,079
What's up

378
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
Is that Mu Huron?

379
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
Up to now?

380
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,240
In fact, that day

381
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,640
I saw the information

382
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,839
on the two sisters.

383
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
The current Su Jin.

384
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Not the real Su Jin.

385
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,440
How about

386
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,000
expose her to the press.

387
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,359
That way, Muhurun

388
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,680
mu Huron will never recover.

389
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,359
Scram!

390
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,559
I'm doing this for your own good.

391
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,200
Scram!

392
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,319
Xu Yadan!

393
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,440
I know your thoughts.

394
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,599
Your aim is to harm Su Jin

395
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
but I warn you,

396
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
this information is the best.

397
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Before this.

398
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,960
If the company fails,

399
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,359
I will not spare you.

400
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,039
I once went

401
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,440
when I was on a field trip,

402
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,440
I watched sunrises and sunsets.

403
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
But this sunrise today

404
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,839
Is the most beautiful one I've ever seen.

405
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,599
Do you know why?

406
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,319
That is because today

407
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,720
I will watch it with you.

408
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,599
You are still

409
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,759
the same narcissistic as before.

410
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,680
You haven't changed at all.

411
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
Why not?

412
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,119
We can.

413
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,440
If Su Jishi

414
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:08,920
don't you know

415
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,759
you are really special.

416
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,839
I know.

417
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
You're full of yourself.

418
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,920
As soon as you appeared,

419
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,839
you disrupted

420
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,640
all my plans in life.

421
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,759
Sometimes I feel that

422
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
you are so like a kite.

423
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,960
Free and free.

424
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,599
And I

425
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
Is like the string

426
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,799
that's pulling the kite.

427
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,680
The more I pull you,

428
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
the higher you fly.

429
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,440
But sometimes I am so scared.

430
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,559
I'm afraid that somehow one day

431
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,599
the string will break.

432
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,079
I'll never be able to find you again.

433
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,400
That's why...

434
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,319
I'd rather

435
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,480
I'd rather

436
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,319
to become a kite?

437
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
Will you take me with you?

438
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,079
Will you marry me?

439
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,799
Yes, I will.

440
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,519
You answer it first.

441
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,599
Hello?

442
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
I am busy.

443
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,519
Can't you come back

444
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,799
can't we talk about it later?

445
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,240
Something happened to Mr. Mu.

446
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
It was exposed.

447
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,319
Got it.

448
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,599
Wait for me upstairs.

449
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,839
I'm already downstairs.

450
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Don't worry.

451
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,440
It will be properly handled.

452
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,799
I'll go up first.

453
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,480
Contact me later.

454
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,000
Alright.

455
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,880
Today it's disclosed that

456
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
the popular female artist Su Jin

457
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
the hottest actress, Su Jin

458
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,799
It was played by

459
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,160
by Su Jishi.

460
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
The more surprising thing is

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,720
su Jin and Mu's Group

462
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,000
the President of Mu Heulen

463
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
and their relationship

464
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,599
resorted to trickery?

465
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,480
To fool the audience.

466
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,839
Please show us

467
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,680
the picture ahead.

468
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,960
Hello, Huron.

469
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm near your company now.

470
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
Let's go camping together tonight.

471
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,119
Alright.

472
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,440
Don't get caught.

473
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
Why do you suddenly come to camp?

474
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,440
This is the first time

475
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
to camp out alone.

476
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,519
To camp alone.

477
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Mr. Mu, you're

478
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,319
you're very skilled now.

479
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,759
It's a must.

480
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,000
Think about it.

481
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,000
I thought it through.

482
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,160
I will help you.

483
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,200
You

484
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,039
are a survival expert in the wild.

485
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,079
As for me,

486
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,839
the tent is not bad.

487
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
When we have time

488
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,519
when we have time,

489
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:22,839
you can

490
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400
have a good adventure in the wild.

491
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,279
Don't take so close photos.

492
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,240
Come on, Mr. Mu.

493
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,839
OK.

494
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,720
Alright.

495
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,079
It's done.

496
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,279
Come. Have a look.

497
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,799
Come, sit down.

498
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,160
It's so beautiful.

499
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,640
My hands are cold.

500
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,839
You know

501
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,160
It's perfect for a song.

502
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,400
What song?

503
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,000
There are horns on my head.

504
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
What are you doing? Are you interviewing me?

505
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,359
Alright.

506
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,160
Reporter Su.

507
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,839
Mu Huron.

508
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,559
Yes, My Lord.

509
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,039
I'm Mu Huron.

510
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:13,920
It's...

511
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,559
Are you happy being with me?

512
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,279
Very happy.

513
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,359
How happy!

514
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,839
So happy?

515
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,559
Mu Huron.

516
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you love me?

517
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,039
Love.

518
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,640
Love me more.

519
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,759
This much.

520
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,680
Will you always love me?

521
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,480
You don't have to answer.

522
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,960
Why are you so dull?

523
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,240
I'm not here.

524
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,559
What's the matter?

525
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,079
Am I too pretty?

526
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,400
That's enough.

527
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,519
From today on,

528
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,240
I'm your man.

529
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,720
So no matter where you go,

530
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,839
you can't leave me behind.

531
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,119
Can you promise me that?

532
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,680
Hello, what's wrong?

533
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,079
You've finally picked up.

534
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,880
Check out the live broadcast link

535
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,599
I sent you.

536
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,960
Dear all,

537
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,640
this is the site of

538
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,039
held by Su Jin.

539
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,720
We will broadcast it live

540
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,839
the press conference.

541
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Su Jin will be on stage soon.

542
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,759
To release her official explanation

543
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,759
about the stuntman incident.

544
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,359
Hello, Mu's Company.

545
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,079
Sorry

546
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,480
we'll take care of this.

547
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,000
Hello. Mu's Company...

548
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,640
Sorry

549
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,200
we can't respond now.

550
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,960
We'll give the public an explanation later.

551
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Sorry, sorry.

552
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,720
Hello. Mu's Group.

553
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,680
To solve this.

554
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,279
Please rest assured.

555
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,319
Please trust us.

556
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,480
That all the terms are valid.

557
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,400
For the moment,

558
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,079
to answer for now.

559
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't worry. This is standard procedure.

560
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,000
The company will

561
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,839
the company later.

562
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,720
Brother.

563
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,400
Mr. Mu, this is the document for you.

564
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,079
Hey.

565
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:13,759
Huron.

566
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,319
The board of directors all hope

567
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,279
to draw a line between

568
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,599
stay away from Su Jin as soon as possible.

569
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,519
The netizens are criticizing Jin Xiu and his wife

570
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,720
are fake couple

571
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,799
you have deceived many netizens.

572
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,720
Some people even said

573
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,359
mr. Mu dared to

574
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,440
to make profits for the company

575
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,319
to make profits for the company.

576
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,000
Could it be that Mr. Mu can't hold on anymore?

577
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,880
Will the company be okay?

578
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

579
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,319
Mr. Mu must have a way

580
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:34,799
a solution.

581
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,000
Don't worry.

582
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,079
High altitude.

583
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,960
It's urgent. I need to leave.

584
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,400
Come with me.

585
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,680
Okay, I'll go drive the car.

586
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,359
Xiaoman,

587
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,519
call Fang Jie

588
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,680
ask about the current situation.

589
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,839
Call me if it's urgent.

590
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,960
Alright, got it.

591
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,640
Hello, Brother Fang Xie.

592
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,200
Alright.

593
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
What's the latest news from here?

594
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,599
Will keep up with you, Xiaoman.

595
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,759
See you later.

596
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,880
Hi, could you please

597
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,640
can you update

598
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
keep up with the news?

599
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,519
We will have

600
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,359
an official announcement.

601
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,400
By then,

602
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,759
miss Su.

603
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,240
Well, why are you

604
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,039
why do you come out?

605
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,160
Where are you going?

606
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,160
Come on. Let's go.

607
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's go inside first.

608
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,440
Miss Su,

609
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,720
I know you're in a bad mood.

610
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,559
But if you just say something,

611
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,000
no wonder I'm not used to this.

612
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,039
Fang Xie, you should

613
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,079
you've never called me

614
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,359
called me Miss Su before.

615
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,079
Little Su, let's stop here.

616
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,319
Without telling Mr. Mu?

617
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,480
Without telling Mr. Mu?

618
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
Are you really alright?

619
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,599
You can't always let him take the responsibility.

620
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,079
He's exhausted

621
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,440
these two days.

622
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:19,680
Hey.

623
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm about to finish the paper.

624
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,799
Have you got a venue

625
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,720
of your product launch?

626
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,599
Miss Su, open the door first.

627
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,240
I have something to tell you in person.

628
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,279
What brings you here suddenly?

629
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,160
Just open the door.

630
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,000
Sis,

631
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,119
jin.

632
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,039
I'm sorry, Sis.

633
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm really sorry.

634
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,079
You are finally back.

635
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,279
Sister.

636
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,599
These past few months,

638
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,240
you've suffered.

639
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Stop crying.

640
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,920
Look at that.

641
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,200
You're about to use up the tissue.

642
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,640
It's only a few months ago.

643
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,480
I thought

644
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,960
have passed the five ice ages.

645
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,920
So during this time,

646
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,519
during this period?

647
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,720
Every time I sent an email,

648
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,880
they only said you're very good

649
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
I was worried.

650
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,319
I went to Africa.

651
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,599
Originally, I just wanted to

652
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,039
travel alone.

653
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,400
Then

654
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
then I met a charity organization

655
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,079
that protects elephants.

656
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,400
Mum once told me that...

657
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,039
Elephants were her favorite.

658
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,840
So I took a lot of pictures

659
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,119
photos of her.

660
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,519
Tell me something.

661
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,840
You took so many nice photos.

662
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,039
But you didn't know to send me any.

663
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,880
I just wanted to be alone.

664
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,840
That's why I cut off

665
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,079
with the outside world.

666
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,320
Later, I met a volunteer

667
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,480
domestic volunteer.

668
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,079
He's a fan of mine.

669
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,840
He told me that

670
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,639
su Jin is still active in China.

671
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
I knew that.

672
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,920
It must be you.

673
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,559
Then I saw

674
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,719
some negative news about me,

675
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,039
and I rushed back home.

676
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,639
I'm sorry,

677
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,159
I made you suffer.

678
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't say sorry anymore.

679
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,199
I'm fine now.

680
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,599
So you and mom

681
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,639
with mom?

682
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,760
Sister.

683
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,719
Mom, she...

684
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,440
Mom.

685
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,360
Sister, you are here.

686
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,800
Sister.

687
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,239
Mother?

688
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,840
When did she leave?

689
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,320
One year ago.

690
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,360
My mom suddenly got sick.

691
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,199
I wanted to tell you that

692
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,639
but mum said you're going to graduate soon

693
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,679
she was afraid that you would worry.

694
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,159
He wouldn't let me tell you.

695
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Mom's illness

696
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,519
deteriorated rapidly.

697
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,679
Target drugs one by one

698
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,639
one by one.

699
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,840
Until one day...

700
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,840
I was doing a scene.

701
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,920
I suddenly panicked.

702
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,800
Then I received a call from the hospital.

703
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,159
Miss Su,

704
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,159
cherish your time.

705
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,599
Mother.

706
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,239
Sister,

707
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,400
we don't have

708
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,400
without a mother.

709
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,599
Mom knows that

710
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,440
your favorite noodles.

711
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,079
She couldn't wait for you to come back.

712
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,320
So she taught me how to make the noodles

713
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,960
how to make the noodles.

714
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,400
I must learn it.

715
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,519
And cook it for you.

716
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,920
Over the years,

717
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,880
has changed.

718
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,400
Was your sister

719
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,199
she was the same as you.

720
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
When she was little,

721
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,159
she was often picky about food.

722
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,440
But she

723
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,320
she loves the noodles

724
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,440
the noodles I made for her.

725
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,920
It's been years.

726
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,320
I miss her.

727
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,960
She must have

728
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
she must have forgotten

729
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,840
the smell.

730
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,079
Maybe

731
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,719
that she doesn't want to mention it anymore.

732
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,199
She is 8 years old,

733
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,440
so your father

734
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,119
take her and leave us.

735
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,519
I know.

736
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,559
She

737
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,760
she's still angry with me.

738
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,480
Mom said that

739
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,199
she didn't grow up with you over these years.

740
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,199
She feels sorry to you.

741
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm the one

742
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,519
who should apologize.

743
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,079
Sister.

744
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,159
Have some water.

745
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm fine. Thank you.

746
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,039
Little Jin, since you're back,

747
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,599
let's get everything back on track.

748
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,719
What is your plan?

749
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,199
Dear all,

750
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,800
this is the temporary

751
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,119
held by Su Jin.

752
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,440
Our channel will broadcast

753
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,559
live streaming the entire episode.

754
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,119
Su Jin is about to make

755
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,000
her explanation

756
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,360
regarding the stand-in incident.

757
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Sir, please drive faster!

758
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,880
They're getting out.

759
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,599
Miss Su,

760
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,159
are you sure you've made up your mind

761
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,079
you really want to do this?

762
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,800
Mr. Mu has been

763
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,920
recently, Mu's Group has suffered

764
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,800
over the past few days.

765
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,280
He shouldn't

766
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,079
should not be borne by him

767
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,480
and his company.
