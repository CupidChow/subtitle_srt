1
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,590
Am I crazy?

2
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,280
Why did I have such a dream?

3
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
With her...

4
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
How can I have any feelings for her?

5
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Boss.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
High altitude.

7
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
This month, the month after,

8
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,910
and the bonuses

9
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,870
next month's bonus?

10
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,400
You're still dreaming?

11
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,910
I'll come back later.

12
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,470
Come back.

13
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,150
What is it?

14
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
The gallery

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,680
that are suitable for investment and acquisition

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,470
suitable for M & A

17
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,470
we've found it.

18
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,430
These are the documents.

19
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,430
Thanks.

20
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,870
Close the door for me.

21
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,400
It's so annoying to get up in the morning.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
Luckily, I saw many big scenes.

23
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,680
Brother.

24
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,280
Have you noticed

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
little Su is different today?

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,750
What's different?

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,150
She was watching the script

28
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,870
while reading the script.

29
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,870
Look at her today.

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,470
She is humming.

31
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,520
After she came home

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,870
with Mr. Mu,

33
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,080
she smiles brightly.

34
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,000
And she loves to work even more.

35
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,120
They are so intimate.

36
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,750
My silly child,

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,680
true feelings are easily to be hurt.

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,520
I hope

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,190
you won't understand these words for the rest of your life.

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,590
What does it mean?

41
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,910
Nothing.

42
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,520
You should

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,470
hurry to buy some glasses

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,430
go buy a cup of stars.

45
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,240
Hurry up.

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,000
You look so happy.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,590
Of course it is.

48
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,870
Do you know how exhausting it is to act?

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,150
Especially Mu Huron.

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,360
I'd rather record more variety shows

51
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,190
than cooperate with him

52
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,870
to cooperate with him for a second longer.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
I knew

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,280
because I felt sorry for Xia for a second.

55
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,520
This child

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,750
still falling into the candy trap

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,870
created by you and Mr. Mu.

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
I hope she knows the truth one day.

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,470
She won't blame me too much, right?

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,840
Enough. Let's stop talking about this.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,150
Let's talk about

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,150
the following work.

63
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,800
The Tian Automobile Advertisement

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,470
have you seen the endorsement of

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,240
of Tianzhou Automobile, right?

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,150
The endorsement

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,470
not only has a high salary,

68
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,150
what's more,

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,120
tianauto is an old brand.

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,710
For so many years.

71
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,120
They've always won praise.

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,830
With almost no problem.

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,720
However,

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
the contract ends

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
will be over.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,120
They wanted to

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,070
fang Xie,

78
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,240
In the future,

79
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,720
a long-term cooperation agreement.

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,270
Can we stop talking?

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,830
Little Su.

82
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Don't reject me first.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,360
It's a win-win for us

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Is a win-win.

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,750
We build up momentum for them.

86
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,240
They

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,870
to enhance our business value.

88
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,480
Why not?

89
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,510
I think you may have forgotten

90
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,070
I'm not Su Jin at all.

91
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,430
I was just helping her clean up the mess.

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,270
I'll leave when the contract expires.

93
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,510
If I sign such a long-term contract,

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,390
when I leave,

95
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,750
and my sister hasn't come back yet.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,630
We still breach the contract.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,870
You and I will

98
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,560
all our efforts

99
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,800
are in vain?

100
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,040
I know that

101
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,070
you always want something lucky.

102
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,830
You hoped that I could stay

103
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,270
I can continue to stay

104
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,310
and continue to be Su Jin.

105
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,830
To continue the glory.

106
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,950
But sorry,

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,040
that's impossible.

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm selfish.

110
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,240
Over the years,

111
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
I've put a lot of efforts

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,870
with Little Jin.

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,270
And also...

114
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,190
Also,

115
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,510
you think after I get into this circle,

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,310
I might get used to

117
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,480
maybe even fall in love

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,750
lively life,

119
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,160
and never want to go back

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
to my cold

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,510
and boring lab of mine.

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm the shallow one.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,240
To take it for granted.

124
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,870
That's right.

125
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,360
But what Fang Jie

126
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,720
what is false cannot become true.

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
We need to recognize the reality.

128
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,830
Enough. Stop pulling a long face.

129
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Look at this.

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
A logo for diamonds says

131
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,270
Is based on rich people.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,270
I think we should revise it.

133
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,480
We should try to expand the scope.

134
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,070
Should not only

135
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,920
to one group.

136
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,680
And like other

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,310
no news.

138
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,720
Three days ago,

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,430
that's impossible.

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,630
Is the signal bad?

141
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,800
Full grid.

142
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,000
Why didn't you comment on your lines

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,510
to comment on the lines lately?

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,720
Okay, come on.

145
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,680
Hold up the diamond.

146
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,240
Right.

147
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
A diamond can be placed next to your ear.

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,480
Great.

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,800
Great.

150
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,680
Relax your hands.

151
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
Don't be so stiff.

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Good, very good.

153
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,830
Very good.

154
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,870
You're doing well.

155
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,630
Keep it up.

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,390
Great.

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,750
Great.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,270
After the kiss,

159
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,040
after kissing you for a week, right?

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,630
Mr. Mu.

161
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,630
Mr. Mu is waiting for a call.

162
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,310
Nothing.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,830
This is the new transaction plan.

164
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,680
Please have a look.

165
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,920
By the way,

166
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,310
when is the next date

167
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,120
when

168
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
why suddenly ask this?

169
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
You never cared about it before.

170
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,310
Recently, I have

171
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,120
I have a lot of things to deal with recently.

172
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
And the acquisition.

173
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,040
If we didn't arrange it in advance,

174
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
I'm afraid that

175
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
to finish the business by then.

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,870
You don't have to worry about that.

177
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,070
The new contract states that

178
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,040
that you only have to

179
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,480
In one month.

180
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,190
This month,

181
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,800
last time when Aunt Hua asked you to go home,

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,480
with you two last time.

183
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Dating in this month.

184
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,240
And the new contract

185
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
explicitly states that

186
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,430
It depends on the work arrangement.

187
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,830
If there's a conflict,

188
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,630
the monthly appointment

189
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,720
can be canceled too.

190
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,120
Will the legal department issue a contract?

191
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,440
Party B is too coddled.

192
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,870
If I remember correctly,

193
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,120
In my memory,

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,960
I think

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,670
modified it yourself.

196
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,870
Forget I asked.

197
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,510
So anxious?

198
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,480
Too impatient to wait

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,670
to date with Miss Su.

200
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,670
Secretary Gao,

201
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,960
do you think the bonus recently deducted

202
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,270
not enough bonus recently?

203
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,080
Let me teach you a way

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,000
to ask out women.

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
A woman? No bonus deduction?

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,150
Tell me about it.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Borrowing and returning something

208
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,270
this is an everlasting trick.

209
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,360
What do you mean?

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,480
The story of Lady Bai and Xu Xian

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,080
the White Lady and Xu Xian, right?

212
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,360
Often the beginning of love

213
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,320
all she needs is an umbrella.

214
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm not asking out women.

215
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,750
Alright.

216
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,480
I want to borrow something,

217
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,750
I want to return it.

218
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,870
Appointment?

219
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,510
Let's go for it.

220
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,480
Little Su, you're so awesome.

221
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,240
You even tore off their nameplates

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
all their badges.

223
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,910
From night to morning,

224
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,870
couldn't hold on anymore.

225
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,630
You didn't even take a breath.

226
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,750
You didn't even breathe?

227
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,030
I would have died earlier.

228
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,080
Good morning, both of you.

229
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,240
Look who texted you.

230
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,360
- Who's this look? - What's that look?

231
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,270
Mr. Mu invited you to dinner.

232
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,240
It seems that things went well

233
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,670
the past few days.

234
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,720
Brother Fang,

235
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,630
that's not progress.

236
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,480
This is madly in love.

237
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,510
It hasn't been long since we parted.

238
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,120
Mr. Mu couldn't wait

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,630
to ask Little Su out.

240
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,270
Tell him I won't.

241
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,360
I'm tired today.

242
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,670
You don't have a schedule today.

243
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,080
Take a good rest.

244
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,360
And make it tonight?

245
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,240
If Jin would be there,

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
she would have arrived.

247
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,910
Mr. Mu, why did you send

248
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,120
a picture of the hammer?

249
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,270
What does that mean?

250
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
About?

251
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
I knew you'll agree.

252
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,480
Mr. Mu,

253
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,320
no need to have dinner with you.

254
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
Breakfast is fine.

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,120
My treat.

256
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,750
You want to see me?

257
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,550
I can't even wait tonight.

258
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
Alright.

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,270
Alright.

260
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,440
At this hour,

261
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
at this hour?

262
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Certainly.

263
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,960
Just come and see me.

264
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,910
I promise to surprise you.

265
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,510
A surprise, right?

266
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,510
I'd like to see

267
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,120
what surprise can you give me?

268
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,960
Change another one.

269
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,750
It should be here.

270
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,000
Boss, what do you want?

271
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,910
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

272
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,630
Mr. Mu,

273
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,910
why are you dressed like this?

274
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,030
Well, why don't you come here

275
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,960
why are you wearing a tie?

276
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,510
My tie is

277
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,480
dress code in public.

278
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,910
You, on the other hand,

279
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,510
what?

280
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,870
It's early morning.

281
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,790
I wore sunglasses

282
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,630
I caught people's eyes.

283
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,000
So I put on a facial mask

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to cover myself up.

285
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,840
What?

286
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,320
Please look carefully.

287
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,750
Right?

288
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,600
That was bad for your image as a female celebrity.

289
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:10,790
She's so beautiful.

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,750
Look at this.

291
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,320
I've always been the

292
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,480
the most eye-catching one here.

293
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,320
Come on.

294
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,790
Boss, I'll take the order.

295
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,670
So this is the surprise you gave me?

296
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,080
Mr. Mu.

297
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Are you going to eat standing up?

298
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,240
Sir, hurry up.

299
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Please take a look at the menu.

300
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,150
Alright.

301
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,840
One salty soy milk,

302
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,790
one steamed dumplings,

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,000
two fried dough sticks,

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
thank you.

305
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
You have so many things to do.

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,080
All your dishes are here.

307
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,360
Mr. Mu, start eating.

308
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,960
This place may look humble,

309
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,750
they are not as expensive

310
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,000
the ones you usually eat.

311
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,720
But still my boss

312
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,870
and started to prepare

313
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,630
for this.

314
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,390
They are so fresh.

315
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,670
Eat some and you'll know.

316
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,270
You know a lot.

317
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,750
The store has been open for years.

318
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,150
When I was little,

319
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,360
we had dinner at his house.

320
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,270
And we like to

321
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,870
like to drink their

322
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,150
their salty soybean milk

323
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,720
we have

324
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,360
who else?

325
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,150
Nothing.

326
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,030
Don't you think it's sweet enough?

327
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,630
The last time I saw it,

328
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,240
to put so much polysaccharides

329
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
their millet congee.

330
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,630
As a 5-year-old boy.

331
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,840
Boy Mu,

332
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,720
you may have cavities after eating

333
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,030
be careful about your tooth decay.

334
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,440
Thank you for asking.

335
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
What?

336
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,080
I always felt that you've changed.

337
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,510
My persona has changed.

338
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,080
Of course I have.

339
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,150
The setting of the circle

340
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,440
look at people in your circle.

341
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,120
But to be honest,

342
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,750
you become more realistic

343
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,550
more real than before.

344
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,960
Mr. Mu.

345
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,840
Are you watching the way I eat

346
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480
and eating with a facial mask,

347
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,120
you think this is real.

348
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,440
How shallow you are!

349
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,510
I just think

350
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,270
you're funny.

351
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,550
Look at the boys over there.

352
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,000
He's so handsome.

353
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,720
Do you want to meet him?

354
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,510
Do you want to friend him on WeChat?

355
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,200
Can you add me on WeChat?

356
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,840
My girlfriend is here.

357
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,960
No. Don't listen to him.

358
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm not related to him.

359
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,480
Make yourselves at home.

360
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,390
How can we be fine?

361
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,240
Look at your outfit.

362
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
You must be an insurance salesman.

363
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,840
If I get your WeChat,

364
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,910
I might be able to

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,630
with you.

366
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,270
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,910
Did you do it on purpose?

368
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Come on.

369
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,510
You're doing this.

370
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
My house is just across the street.

371
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,910
How about you go to my house?

372
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,960
Go to her house?

373
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
This is the only way.

374
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,630
Sorry

375
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm leaving now.

376
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,440
Come in.

377
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
I didn't notice it last time.

378
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,030
Female entertainers are all

379
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
that casual.

380
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm not that particular.

381
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,480
And when we went to the field

382
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,870
during the team building,

383
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,750
any stuttering,

384
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,270
to have a place to sleep.

385
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,550
You stepped on my clothes.

386
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,840
Sorry.

387
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,440
You are shy sometimes.

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,240
This is the underwear

389
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,870
that I will endorse.

390
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,080
It has no burden on the body.

391
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,030
And the upper body can move freely.

392
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,120
What do you think? You can have it.

393
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,870
No need.

394
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,480
The Outlook of Geochemistry.

395
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,510
You really did

396
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,670
for me.

397
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,270
How could you touch others' things?

398
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,750
Hey.

399
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,670
What do you mean?

400
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,150
Why did you put this

401
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
put that on my photo?

402
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,270
You're an eyesore.

403
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
You're an eyesore.

404
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,750
It has to be

405
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,670
my photo with Director Zhang.

406
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,910
But you insisted getting involved.

407
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,840
Miss Su,

408
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,870
I think you

409
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,200
don't say what you mean.

410
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,270
In this case, we can't

411
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,150
to catch my attention.

412
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,720
Why don't you

413
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,320
mr. Mu,

414
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,510
you're really full of yourself.

415
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,510
So let's go get them fixed.

416
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,480
The toilet is ahead.

417
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:04,920
Where?

418
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,070
Go straight and turn right.

419
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,830
I was lying to attract him.

420
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Thank you, Xiaoman.

421
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,000
Thank you for taking care of me

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,270
such a good breakfast.

423
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,550
You're such a good man.

424
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,270
You're such a virtuous woman.

425
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,440
Don't mention it.

426
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,110
I need breakfast anyway.

427
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,680
No bother.

428
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,110
Secretary Gao.

429
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,070
You two are very free recently.

430
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Since you are free,

431
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,240
why don't you

432
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,310
go to my office

433
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,680
make a backup copy of

434
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,550
every week.

435
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,550
Work.

436
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,350
Alright.

437
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Mu Huron.

438
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,550
Are you out of your mind?

439
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,160
You wanted to kiss her?

440
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,640
Calm down.

441
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,070
You are Muhurun.

442
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,790
You

443
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,480
fell asleep.

444
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,310
What did you eat just now?

445
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,680
Fried dough sticks.

446
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,920
He's so cute.

447
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,880
Is she answering all questions?

448
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,920
The kiss that night...

449
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,440
Was it because

450
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,790
working together?

451
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,750
Really?

452
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,830
Just cooperation?

453
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,960
It was an illusion.

454
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,510
Alright.

455
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,440
That's great.

456
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,680
They are working together.

457
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,550
Mr. Mu,

458
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,480
7 pm tonight,

459
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,030
the CEOs

460
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,590
of the Nickel Mine Company

461
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,880
to host you at W Business Hotel

462
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,160
and discuss the acquisition.

463
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,480
Why did you call me here?

464
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,240
There's nothing else.

465
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,000
Just to make me admire you?

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
For your hard work.

467
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
Just assume it as you are.

468
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,070
Anyway, you're here for the day

469
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,510
I think you just want to mind my business.

470
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,440
My brother will look after me. You will, too.

471
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,270
You never asked if I needed it.

472
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,270
This is annoying.

473
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,480
Little Su.

474
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,750
You've already had a good rest.

475
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,920
Say it quickly.

476
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,680
I told you about the Tianche

477
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,110
I told you about the Tianche?

478
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,160
I thought we weren't going to continue.

479
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,920
Yes

480
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,070
wouldn't renew the contract.

481
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,920
But Ms. Huang

482
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
treat you to a meal.

483
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,880
I won't go.

484
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,510
You didn't want to renew your contract. Why are you eating?

485
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,030
My goodness,

486
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,070
they're not cooperating anymore.

487
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,030
That's why we have to go.

488
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,920
After all, you're not renewing the contract.

489
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
We need to make it clear face to face.

490
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
You won't renew your contract?

491
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
The other entertainers in our company

492
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,960
will have to work with others

493
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,160
I have to cooperate with others.

494
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
We can't offend anyone.

495
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,510
Offend advertisers?

496
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,830
Do you have to go?

497
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,110
It won't be long.

498
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,000
One to two hours at most.

499
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,920
Just one hour.

500
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
Okay, get changed.

501
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,590
Come on.

502
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,510
My goodness.

503
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,400
Mr. Mu,

504
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,830
Isn't that Miss Su?

505
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,640
Mr. Mu, where's my hammer?

506
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,110
What's the matter? Did you annoy him again?

507
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,510
Nothing.

508
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,350
What a coincidence, Miss Su.

509
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,590
It's Mu Xiulun and Su Jin.

510
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,640
Mr. Mu.

511
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,400
Where's my hammer?

512
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,750
Mr. Mu.

513
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,510
There are people watching.

514
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,550
Should we go in with Miss Su

515
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,790
with Miss Su?

516
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,200
Secretary Gao,

517
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,920
what are you doing again?

518
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,510
Huron!

519
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,110
Your tie is askew.

520
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,720
You are really good at acting.

521
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,350
But I won't be affected

522
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,160
to be affected by you.

523
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,550
Your acting skills have improved recently.

524
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,030
After all, the acting class is worth learning.

525
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,550
All right.

526
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,790
What are you doing here?

527
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,830
I'm here to discuss something with Tian Auto.

528
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,680
To renew your contract?

529
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,110
Not really.

530
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,720
That I didn't renew my contract.

531
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,030
Mr. Mu, is that enough?

532
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,920
Fang Xie,

533
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,070
mr. Mu, we are in Private Room 6.

534
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,110
Just call us if you need.

535
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Let's go, Mr. Mu.

536
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,880
This way, please.

537
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,790
I found that

538
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,550
after you visited

539
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,880
mr. Mu's old residence,

540
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
your cooperation with Mr. Mu

541
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,640
has been flawless.

542
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,510
Are the two of you

543
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,960
stop thinking.

544
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,480
There's absolutely no chance between me and him.

545
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,640
Don't be so sure.

546
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,270
Right?

547
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,960
Told everyone about it?

548
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,240
Those closely involved cannot see clearly

549
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
this way, please.

550
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,750
OK. Thank you.

551
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,640
Mr. Huang and Mr. Cui.

552
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,880
Su Jin.

553
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
They're just advertisers.

554
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
You are finally here.

555
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
You're so late.

556
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,640
Shouldn't you make it three cups of wine as a punishment?

557
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,270
Three cups of wine as a punishment.

558
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,680
Don't you think you're qualified?

559
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,750
Make yourselves at home.

560
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Miss Su,

561
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,110
come here.

562
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,350
Sit over here.

563
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,510
Sit here.

564
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,480
Ms. Huang,

565
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,590
that's the main seat.

566
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,400
It's not suitable.

567
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,160
She's not suitable?

568
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,590
Boss,

569
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,350
why do we suddenly change to Room 5?

570
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,680
That you are so reluctant to part?

571
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,160
What is that?

572
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,480
I just think that

573
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,070
that box has poor daylighting.

574
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,830
Poor lighting.

575
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,550
No one should believe you.

576
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,070
Miss Su,

577
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,790
we hope

578
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,960
our cooperation

579
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,720
our cooperation.

580
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,310
Certainly.

581
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,270
As for the cost,

582
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,310
Is no problem,

583
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,590
we can discuss it.

584
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,310
The quality

585
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
of the best.

586
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Our market share is high.

587
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,070
Low rework rate.

588
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,750
So this endorsement

589
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,680
rest assured.

590
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,680
With Si Lili.

591
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,070
The product

592
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,160
your company's products.

593
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,830
Well-known here

594
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,270
when will the dinner be over?

595
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,750
How about this?

596
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,240
I'd like to propose a toast to you all.

597
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,270
Come on.

598
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,240
Hold on.

599
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,790
You are the one who drank the wine,

600
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
and you're talking.

601
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,030
Is that Miss Su dumb?

602
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,110
She dares to offend me?

603
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,160
The reason why Su Jin

604
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,880
she is shy.

605
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,550
He doesn't speak well.

606
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,030
Forget about it.

607
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,550
I can tolerate nothing but calm.

608
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,720
But we're confused.

609
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,480
We are a big brand.

610
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,640
Right?

611
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,160
Then those celebrities

612
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,880
waiting to be endorsed.

613
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,160
I eat such dinners every day.

614
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,000
However,

615
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,350
I'm a fan of yours!

616
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,640
Miss Su.

617
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
How could a celebrity

618
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,350
pull a long face?

619
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,680
Give us a smile.

620
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,400
Ms. Huang, I'm so sorry.

621
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,480
My daughter is really

622
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,680
Is really unwell today.

623
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,070
How about I drink the wine for her?

624
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,720
What do you think?

625
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,310
You like to drink?

626
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,640
To satisfy you.

627
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,750
After all, Miss Su is a celebrity

628
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,960
as well as Guard Su.

629
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,110
Three cups.

630
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,590
Did you bully Xiaojin

631
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,920
before.

632
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,510
May I have a smoke?

633
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,960
You don't mind, right?

634
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,720
I mind.

635
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,640
Just kidding, Mr. Huang.

636
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,880
Su Jin,

637
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,270
I will teach you one rule today.

638
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,720
How do you treat us as men?

639
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,510
Ask you women

640
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,350
If we smoke?

641
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,240
You women

642
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
for her,

643
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,680
then they don't mind.

644
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,350
I'm asking for your advice.

645
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't take that seriously.

646
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
She's not young anymore.

647
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,110
It's time for me to know something.

648
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Alright, Ms. Huang.

649
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,070
Good wine!

650
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,790
I pour a cup of wine on you.

651
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,830
Do you mind?

652
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
It's on fire!

653
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,400
Hurry up!

654
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,480
Fang Xie, the celebrity...

655
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,790
A celebrity splashed wine on me.

656
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,160
Miss Su,

657
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,030
that's illegal to kill.

658
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
Anyone who dares to touch me

659
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,550
I think you really want to

660
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,030
you need giving a lesson.

661
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,880
Su Jin, you...

662
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,310
Back off.

663
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,720
Boss Huang.

664
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,550
You can't hit me.

665
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,270
Who would plot against me?

666
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,030
I...

667
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,270
Mr. Mu.

668
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,640
That was a good kick.

669
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,790
I should be blamed for that.

670
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,160
Director Huang.

671
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
Su Jin is my fiancée.

672
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,920
Come to me if you need anything.

673
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Nothing.

674
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,510
Why is it bleeding?

675
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,640
Scars can't be left

676
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,750
on the actress.

677
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,790
I'm alright.

678
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,880
This one is on me.

679
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,920
I can walk on my own.

680
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,960
You're so thoughtful, Mr. Mu.

681
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,480
If you are

682
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,160
If it is posted online,

683
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,350
It will captivate thousands of girls.

684
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,640
You still have the mood to tease me?

685
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,110
Can you not be so impulsive next time?

686
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,400
This time it's just a flesh wound.

687
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,160
No one can guarantee that

688
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
what you'll encounter next time.

689
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,200
Are you worried about me?

690
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,550
I'm worried

691
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,720
I'm worried about myself.

692
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,790
The fact that you are so reckless right now

693
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,270
which is totally beyond my expectation.

694
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,510
In the future,

695
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,160
you will bring me trouble in the future.

696
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,830
I'm troublesome. Don't mind me.

697
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,550
A contract couple is still a couple.

698
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,240
They're watching you.

699
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,160
How could you leave them alone?

700
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,240
Mr. Mu is really

701
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Is a qualified partner.

702
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,830
No matter what,

703
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,750
I always think

704
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,880
I did the right thing today.

705
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,030
A mad dog that bites people is indeed dangerous.

706
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,270
But the more you let it bite you,

707
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,480
the more he dares to bully you next time.

708
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,310
And bite you harder.

709
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:07,880
On the contrary,

710
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,750
If you

711
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,440
severely once,

712
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,160
the next time he sees you,

713
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,440
his head will be lowered

714
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,240
and wagging his tail.

715
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,680
To look at you.

716
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,830
Su Jin,

717
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,160
a mad dog has fangs.

718
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,590
Do you have one?

719
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,790
Remember this.

720
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,030
Next time you beat the dog,

721
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,270
you don't have to play hardball.

722
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
You could

723
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,350
use an outside force?

724
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,590
Are you the one

725
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,590
Is you, right?

726
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,240
Remember, we are just a couple

727
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,880
we are just a contract couple.

728
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,160
I remember that better than you.

729
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,960
Don't keep reminding me.

730
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,400
Thank you for the medicine, Mr. Mu.

731
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Thank you for your advice, Mr. Mu.

732
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,750
However,

733
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,550
If there's another time

734
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,750
I will do the same.

735
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,480
It's getting late.

736
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,510
I'm going to have a rest too.

737
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,680
If there's nothing else,

738
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
you should leave too.

739
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,310
You are really more stubborn than everyone else.

740
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,680
Mr. Mu.

741
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,440
Hello, Gao Ling.

742
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,590
To sell our group

743
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,440
of our Group and

744
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,310
please find out

745
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,680
all our cooperation projects.

746
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,110
All right, Mr. Mu.

747
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:21,960
She hung up.

748
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,960
He finally left.

749
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,680
Is nothing more than a partnership.

750
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,790
Why bother?

751
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,590
You can still

752
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,070
use some outside power.

753
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,240
Hello?

754
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,640
Has he reached home?

755
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,750
How about the leg wound?

756
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
It has been applied medicine, and all treatment has been done.

757
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,880
Don't worry.

758
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,880
What do I have to worry about?

759
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,790
With Mr. Mu around,

760
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,070
I'm at ease in anything.

761
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,680
But today

762
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,440
he's

763
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,830
really nervous about you?

764
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,200
I wasn't acting.

765
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,200
You've worked together for a long time,

766
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,070
don't you know that

767
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,880
when it comes to acting,

768
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,400
mu Hurun is much more professional than me.

769
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
That's true.

770
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,830
In front of the camera.

771
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,400
Mr. Mu's performance

772
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,550
more natural than you.

773
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,270
I can't.

774
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,160
From tomorrow,

775
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,960
I must give you

776
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
more acting lessons.

777
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,960
You devil!

778
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,960
Nervous?

779
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,200
You're just concerned about our partner.

780
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,720
You don't seem

781
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
that unpleasant to me.

782
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,480
However,

783
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,640
stay away from you.

784
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,510
After all, we only have an agreement.

785
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,000
Good morning, Little Su.

786
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,070
Good morning!

787
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,720
So happy to be in a relationship?

788
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,750
It's Mr. and Mrs. Jinxiu's candy.

789
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,680
It's delicious.

790
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,310
The story of Mr. Mu taking you

791
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,790
leaving the hotel with you.

792
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,640
It's like a real life version of the prince fighting with the dragon

793
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,880
who saves a princess.

794
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,440
Is the queen of dragon fighting

795
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,830
come on.

796
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,070
What kind of hairstyle is this?

797
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,640
As if the Black and White Impermanence

798
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,880
you know what?

799
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,310
When I got up this morning,

800
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,790
my left eyelid jumped wildly.

801
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,000
It's a bad omen.

802
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,680
That's feudal superstition.

803
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,440
The photos we took today

804
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
the approval of Automobile Group

805
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,790
gentlemanly style.

806
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm afraid the matter

807
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
because of what happened yesterday

808
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,640
she's up to.

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,440
My hunch has always been accurate.

810
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,750
We should be careful.

811
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,440
Calm down.

812
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,400
No matter what trouble you come across,

813
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,590
we won't be able to stop him.

814
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,510
Today,

815
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,270
just finish the work.

816
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,790
Shan, let's go.

817
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Very good. That's a good move.

818
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,590
Let's take another one.

819
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,070
Brother Fang,

820
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,840
the outfit she's wearing

821
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,760
for the cover theme

822
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,230
for our cover shoot today?

823
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,840
Well, what's going on?

824
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,550
Sorry

825
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,670
It is an accident.

826
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,280
It was

827
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
that our plan was careless.

828
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,480
To send the same proposal

829
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,400
to both artists at the same time.

830
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,280
Now you've seen it.

831
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
The other artist

832
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,920
was on the scene earlier

833
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,030
they have already started shooting.

834
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,070
We're one step behind.

835
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,670
We can only shoot

836
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,840
another theme.

837
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
No planner would make

838
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,190
make such a stupid mistake.

839
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
They're bullying us.

840
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
Saying so many things now

841
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,190
of your plan.

842
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,480
We should hurry up

843
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,150
for the next outfit on the inner page.

844
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,110
Mr. Huang is a good friend

845
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,320
are close friends.

846
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,030
It seems that today

847
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,880
united Magazine embarrassed us today.

848
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,400
They even

849
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
we are not getting along well with,

850
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
xu Yadan came to annoy us?

851
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,630
Miss Su.

852
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,510
The magazine inside is also good.

853
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,880
Just read it.

854
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,150
I want to do it too.

855
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,510
It's a pity

856
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,400
I've got their cover shot.

857
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,190
It's almost done.

858
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,630
I can't waste

859
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,230
the fruits of our hard work.

860
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,510
Am I right?

861
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,510
You're right.

862
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,320
It stands to reason

863
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
reasonable!

864
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,630
Do you think I'm a pushover?

865
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,630
Since you like shooting so much,

866
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,630
the two themes are yours now.

867
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,840
I won't give you that then.

868
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,670
Little Su, we're really quitting.

869
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,190
Right.

870
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,710
This is indeed annoying,

871
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,510
but if we do leave,

872
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,280
we will give in to Xu Yadan

873
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,440
to them?

874
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,030
The cover is gone,

875
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,840
as well as the inside page.

876
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,590
And the netizens don't know

877
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,000
what to say.

878
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,280
If it were my sister,

879
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,230
will she?

880
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,840
I think so.

881
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,630
This is quite disgusting,

882
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,510
but your sister has a good temper.

883
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,840
She won't take it personally.

884
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,030
Unfortunately,

885
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,880
I have

886
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I have a bad temper,

887
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,230
you're also a grudge holder.

888
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,670
Little Su, you have a sister.

889
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,630
You misheard.

890
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,670
It's Beibei.

891
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,320
Babe.

892
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,880
Miss Su.

893
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,920
Miss Su.

894
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,880
No, I won't.

895
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,070
Miss Su.

896
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,280
I know you are upset.

897
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,920
Actually,

898
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,550
It's all the fault

899
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,190
my staff's mistake.

900
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Should we

901
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,630
my entire planning team

902
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,670
photography, costumes and sets

903
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,030
they're all ready.

904
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,030
If you leave this way,

905
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,280
everyone's efforts will be

906
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
would be wasted!

907
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Brother.

908
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,510
How many years have you worked?

909
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,590
Five years.

910
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,840
You became a chief editor in five years.

911
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,960
You are good at working.

912
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,320
Miss Su,

913
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,510
I'm flattered.

914
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,840
You know that too.

915
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,230
If it's only a five-day work,

916
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,480
I would give you

917
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,840
this opportunity.

918
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,070
But now you're working on your own.

919
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,030
In your work.

920
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,150
And tried to kidnap her morally,

921
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,190
and shift the blame onto others.

922
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,510
Sorry

923
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,590
I won't buy your story.

924
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,000
Sorry

925
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,670
little Su is so cool.

926
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,630
Don't play around.

927
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,110
Offend the magazine.

928
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,230
It won't do us any good.

929
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,000
Make a call right now.

930
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,840
Alright.

931
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll call Mr. Mu now.

932
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,960
In the past,

933
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,190
you didn't need Mr. Mu at all.

934
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,840
Secretary Gao solved the problem with just one call.

935
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,960
Who gave you the right to call him?

936
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,760
To every magazine publisher.

937
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,000
Shan, let's go.

938
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,800
Hold on.

939
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,510
Let's sort it out.

940
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,150
You

941
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,840
the hottest female star now.

942
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,800
In the years after her debut,

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,590
I've always kept a pure image.

944
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,440
Now you want to change

945
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,230
change your image in this way?

946
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,150
She will definitely

947
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,190
many critics.

948
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,360
Why don't we consider it?

949
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,920
Why should I

950
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,710
because of

951
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,800
and hide the beauty

952
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,760
her beauty.

953
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,190
Her innocence is indeed

954
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,440
a safety card indeed.

955
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
But to show myself

956
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,920
a beautiful vessel has no shame.

957
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
It should be encouraged instead.

958
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,760
I love Little Su's

959
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
her confidence

960
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,030
from your soul.

961
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Thank you for your liking.

962
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,360
I like myself, too.

963
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,590
Alright.

964
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,590
You are my ancestor.

965
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
I'll follow your words.

966
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,400
Come on.

967
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,960
Brother.

968
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,280
Brother, have you watched the news?

969
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
A big news about sister-in-law.

970
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,590
Big pictures.

971
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,710
This is her job.

972
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,920
What's the big deal?

973
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
My sister-in-law is now

974
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,510
she has so many admirers.

975
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,760
When this picture is published,

976
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,590
he will have more pursuers.

977
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
With all due respect,

978
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,360
by that time,

979
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,510
your competitiveness will plummet.

980
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,960
Don't be ridiculous.

981
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,150
Better than your brother.

982
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,440
He's not born yet.

983
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,920
How narcissistic.

984
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,190
She's got many competitors.

985
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,110
It's none of my business.

986
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,630
It's none of your business.

987
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,190
You're acting like this.

988
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,960
Don't lose track of your wife then.

989
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,840
If you have nothing to do,

990
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,800
go hang out with Gao Ling.

991
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,550
He's rather free.

992
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,510
I'm busy.

993
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,000
Care about yourself first.

994
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,320
Honey.

995
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
The people nowadays are really

996
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,760
they don't have any moral standards.

997
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,110
You can call her "wife" at will.

998
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,320
My competitiveness has plummeted.

999
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,230
How is that possible?

1000
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,070
The market of Muhulun

1001
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,190
to be a huge market.

1002
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,280
Su Jin is in the top search.

1003
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,960
Go notify them.

1004
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,630
Get them to prepare

1005
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,760
three new plans.

1006
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,760
I'll talk to Su Jin later.

1007
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
With Su Jin later.

1008
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,190
As long as we can get this cover,

1009
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,880
we can detonate the

1010
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,110
this issue of magazine

1011
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,480
what on earth is going on?

1012
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,110
Sister, this is bad.

1013
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,070
Su Jin got it out that

1014
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,360
that she wants to take large-scale photos.

1015
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,150
It's all over the Internet now.

1016
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,110
This is impossible.

1017
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,190
I can't be wrong.

1018
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,190
She also requires

1019
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,150
be a front-line cover.

1020
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,000
The issue of our current issue

1021
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,510
Is obviously planning

1022
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,920
to compete with us this season.

1023
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,760
Now the major magazines

1024
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,190
have started to plan.

1025
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,800
They are stealing their talent.

1026
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,150
Good for you, Su Jin.

1027
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,150
Steal my thunder again?

1028
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,590
Hello, Mom?

1029
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,190
Be honest with me.

1030
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
What's going on between you and Xiaojin?

1031
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,190
You're always

1032
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,710
who's protective of you.

1033
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,280
How come

1034
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,760
and let her be bullied?

1035
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,360
And someone stole the cover,

1036
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,510
and asked her to save the situation

1037
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,760
and save the situation.

1038
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,710
What's it?

1039
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,360
Did you two have a fight?

1040
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,800
We didn't fight.

1041
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,510
We didn't fight.

1042
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,960
How did it end up like this?

1043
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,230
You want to lie to me again?

1044
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,550
Did you break up?

1045
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,510
How could that be possible?

1046
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,550
Not only did we not break up, we...

1047
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
We...

1048
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,590
We're cohabiting.

1049
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,280
Cohabiting?

1050
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,000
If you don't believe this,

1051
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,480
you can check up on me anytime.

1052
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,710
The address will be sent to you later.

1053
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,280
She hung up.

1054
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,670
Are you cohabitation?

1055
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,760
I am so clever.

1056
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,000
Don't delay. Do it tomorrow.

1057
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,110
Fang Xie,

1058
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,030
I have nothing to do today.

1059
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,230
Am I dreaming?

1060
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
Just dreaming at noon?

1061
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
You need to get used to

1062
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,960
you'll see me every day.

1063
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,510
At least for the time being.

1064
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,550
What do you mean?

1065
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,710
Literally.

1066
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,670
What the hell?

1067
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,070
I fully understand how you want

1068
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,360
to appease your mother.

1069
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,190
But the contract

1070
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,960
doesn't stipulate that

1071
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,150
of cohabitation.

1072
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,280
Even if you have to deal with Aunt Hua,

1073
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,230
this is too much.

1074
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,840
Also,

1075
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,960
I'm used to

1076
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,000
living alone.

1077
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,630
And never want any male

1078
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,280
to show up

1079
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,190
of my private life.

1080
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,550
We have another date

1081
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,550
one more date this month.

1082
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,800
You mean a perfect date.

1083
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,320
But dating doesn't mean cohabitation.

1084
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,400
It's not in the contract.

1085
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,800
No cohabitation while dating.

1086
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,190
It's clearly written in the contract.

1087
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,550
You can only have one date per month.

1088
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,630
Even if you used it once today,

1089
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,760
and we have to move out tomorrow.

1090
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,000
But the duration of each date isn't specified in the contract.

1091
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,880
How long each date will take.

1092
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,150
So I request that this date

1093
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,000
Is for one week.

1094
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,190
Mu Huron.

1095
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,800
You are distorting the terms of the contract.

1096
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,760
You can have doubts on the contract,

1097
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,590
you can also hire a lawyer

1098
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,150
and have it revised by a lawyer.

1099
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,510
But before we modify it,

1100
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,440
you have to strictly execute

1101
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,800
the terms in front of you.

1102
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,760
Of course,

1103
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,960
you can also directly breach the contract.

1104
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,440
That's going too far
