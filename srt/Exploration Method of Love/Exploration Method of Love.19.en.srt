1
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,159
Sister-in-law, where are you?

2
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,599
I'll go find you.

3
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
I have something to do now.

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,480
At an event.

5
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,200
Something happened.

6
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,959
What activity?

7
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,120
Brother Fang,

8
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,640
su Su's popularity

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,200
more and more popular.

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,040
Right.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
The audience rating

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,480
the audience rating has been off the charts.

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,599
Brother Fang,

14
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,879
are we going to

15
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,400
out of Asia and into the world?

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
You

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,439
don't be worried.

18
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,000
Although today's event

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,199
Is not open to the public.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,840
But you should still be careful.

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
There won't be any trouble.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Got it.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,360
Miss Su, check this place.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,879
-Here Miss Su. -Miss Su.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,439
Media teachers, thank you for your hard work.

26
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank you all.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,080
Thanks to all the mentors

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
from all the instructors.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,800
This is the end

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
for today.

31
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,000
Please leave in an orderly way.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,879
Thank you all.

33
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,719
Thank you very much.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,159
Xia.

35
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,039
Xiaoman.

36
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,919
Xiao Xia.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,599
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,439
How can you go on like that?

39
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,520
Are you blind?

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,400
No, I...

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Where is my ring?

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,280
It is also platinum.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
What about the ring?

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Is it this one?

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,639
Look at these.

46
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,080
You're splitting it.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

48
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:03,919
Compensate?

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,280
How are you going to compensate with it?

50
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,960
My husband custom-made this for me

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
from rare minerals.

52
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,560
In that case,

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll take the minerals as compensation.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
But you're very arrogant.

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
Is your family mine?

56
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,680
She really has a mine.

57
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,879
Let me see if it's a rare ore.

58
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,439
This is copper ore.

59
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,599
And slightly oxidized.

60
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,960
It's not a rare ore.

61
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,960
Rest assured, her family can afford it.

62
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,759
You're an actress. What do you know?

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,199
My husband said that

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
this is a new mineral

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,199
that has not yet been discovered.

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,479
You just said that

67
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,520
your husband

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,960
by your husband.

69
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,319
But just now she

70
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,759
the ring was off

71
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
the ring fell off.

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
If it's really

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,639
Is a rare ore,

74
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,000
the size of the ring

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Is too hasty.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,159
Your husband wouldn't

77
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,800
made some gifts for others?

78
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,919
What's up

79
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,960
honey.

80
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,240
What's wrong with this ring?

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,759
They told me

82
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,960
they aren't new minerals.

83
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,039
No one?

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Director Wang.

85
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,240
I got this

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
on a business trip to Yiliang Mountain.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
The company said that

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
there were suspected new minerals

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
there are suspected new minerals.

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,000
The mine would be closed down.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,000
I thought this stone is special.

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
So I took out a small piece

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,839
to make a ring

94
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,959
to make his wife happy.

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,480
Yiliang Mountain?

96
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,079
Right.

97
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,319
But then she said there were no new minerals.

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,079
I knew she liked this ring so much,

99
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,639
that's why I'm too shy to tell her.

100
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,000
You told me that

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,720
that it's more precious than diamonds?

102
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,319
Alright, yours is Wang!

103
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,160
No more!

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry to let you see this.

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,079
Honey.

106
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,279
Xiaoman.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,839
Give it to me.

108
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,240
Miss Su, it's time for the interview.

109
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
I'll go occupy a good position

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,560
to take photos for you.

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Fang Xie,

112
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,360
rent a lab for me.

113
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,240
Laboratory

114
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll send you the specific requirements

115
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
later.

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Don't tell Mu Hulun

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,839
about this.

118
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,399
I want to give him a surprise.

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,959
All right.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
Great. Done.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,759
Mr. Mu,

122
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,519
the test report

123
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,399
from the company's laboratory.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Gao Ling invites Gong Zheng.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Alright.

126
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,199
Look at this.

127
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
This was the last time

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,079
that my mentor took

129
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,519
during our expedition to China,

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,199
he found suspected new mineral

131
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,560
on Yiliang Mountain.

132
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,720
Mr. Mu.

133
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,680
Mr. Zheng has arrived.

134
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you sure about

135
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,560
this is the final test result.

136
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,160
Yes, Mr. Mu.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
We're all sorry to hear that.

138
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,800
It's true that no new mineral

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,959
no new mineral has been found.

140
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,800
Mr. Mu,

141
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,279
this project has been with me

142
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,680
since I first came here.

143
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,319
When I first found

144
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,639
there seems to be a new mineral,

145
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,879
everyone was excited.

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,959
But after that

147
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,079
all kinds of research and testing,

148
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,040
at least a hundred,

149
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,759
no matter what.

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,439
If you are worried,

151
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,439
you can recheck the whole process

152
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,360
follow-up the whole process again.

153
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm afraid the result will still be the same.

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
Someone who doesn't even trust

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
his team.

156
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,920
You will lose the popularity of the people.

157
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,399
A CEO who couldn't make money

158
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,160
and indecisive

159
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,519
be a law onto oneself

160
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,439
what will I lose?

161
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Inform everyone

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,040
restart the Yiliang Mountain project.

163
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,560
Understood.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,159
Hello, this is Mr. Mu.

165
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,200
From Mr. Mu from your home.

166
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,919
Are they OK?

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
He said no to it.

168
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
It's harder

169
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,720
than out in the wild.

170
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Never mind. Who asked the

171
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,399
the kids like it.

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
Please cooperate.

173
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,720
Very important things

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,600
at work.

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
She came back very late.

176
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Don't wait for me.

177
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,639
Go to bed early after dinner.

178
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,960
Something important.

179
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,279
Did he see me secretly

180
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,840
I secretly put it

181
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,120
the report in his bag.

182
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Not bad. He is quite patient.

183
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,519
How could it be?

184
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,759
I gave the report.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
Why did you still activate it?

186
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
Xiaoman, don't be angry.

187
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,519
Your brother was really

188
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,639
It was urgent.

189
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,840
It's my intention too.

190
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,320
Hello, baby.

191
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,399
What are you doing?

192
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,919
I'm surfing the internet.

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm trying to figure out

194
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,360
so that my girlfriend wouldn't be angry.

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,879
Fool.

196
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,679
I am stupid.

197
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,799
I've known you for so long.

198
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,039
I thought

199
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,240
and knew your hobby well,

200
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,519
but I never thought

201
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,399
I didn't expect anything would work

202
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,639
nothing works.

203
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,559
Do you have any hints?

204
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,600
My brother moved to

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,159
and reunite with my sister-in-law.

206
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,759
Which one

207
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,519
being alone at home.

208
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,200
That's right.

209
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,159
I'll live in such a big house all by myself.

210
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,200
You were scared, right?

211
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,240
Will your mom be with you?

212
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,080
No, she can't.

213
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,159
It's fine. I'll keep you company.

214
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,720
Turn on all the lights

215
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,879
at home,

216
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,639
don't hang up.

217
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,679
I'll stay here

218
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,559
to keep you company.

219
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't want to see you again.

220
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
Xiaoman.

221
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,759
Staying up late and being angry

222
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,879
or being angry.

223
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,879
Go to bed.

224
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,399
You won't be afraid if you fall asleep.

225
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,360
See you tomorrow. Good night.

226
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,759
Why are you still up?

227
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,399
I'm waiting for you.

228
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,639
Sorry

229
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,840
for not coming back today

230
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,080
to celebrate your anniversary with you.

231
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,639
The surprise you prepared today

232
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,360
I like it so much

233
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,240
very happy.

234
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,919
Very happy to announce the mining operation.

235
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,879
I'm the president of Mu's Group after all.

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,759
As for everything,

237
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,000
we should look at the big picture.

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Please understand me.

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm sorry. I really

240
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,240
to understand that.

241
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,080
Because I trust you

242
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,360
In you.

243
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,600
I thought you really

244
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
about this.

245
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,480
But in fact,

246
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,159
please hear me out.

247
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,879
Do you know that

248
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,320
when you told me

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,440
the new mineral resources in Yiliang Mountain,

250
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I was really excited.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,960
But today...

252
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,480
What's the matter, Second Uncle?

253
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,639
Huron, I hate to bother you,

254
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,080
but a few of our shareholders

255
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,240
coming tomorrow.

256
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,159
They want you to explain

257
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,440
the wrong decision made

258
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,720
at Yiliang Mountain for two years.

259
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,919
Nephew, think about it.

260
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,879
How to deal with their difficulties.

261
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,679
Got it.

262
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,639
I'm your second uncle.

263
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,080
I can only help you this much.

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,720
Alright.

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
I'll listen to your explanation.

266
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,960
Have an early rest

267
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,200
high altitude.

268
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
Since you and my brother

269
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,919
worked overnight again,

270
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm not mad at you anymore.

271
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,720
I brought you

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,960
to bring you breakfast.

273
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Where is my brother?

274
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,799
The shareholders are busy coping when they come.

275
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,759
Whatever, you eat first.

276
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,440
You're right.

277
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,360
Your brother is so young

278
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,440
managed Mu's Clan for so many years.

279
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,559
We've never made

280
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,799
any wrong decision.

281
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,559
Although some people in the company disobeyed him,

282
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,000
they couldn't do anything to him.

283
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,639
But this time,

284
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
about Yiliang Mountain.

285
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,799
And delayed the mining.

286
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,639
Those old guys

287
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,639
It's like seizing something

288
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
a great mistake,

289
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
such an incredible mistake.

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,159
You

291
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,240
eat.

292
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,039
Is it good?

293
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,120
Don't you worry about your brother?

294
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,879
What's there to worry about?

295
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
He'll be fine.

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
You're very confident.

297
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,879
You know...

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,919
What do I know?

299
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,759
Don't be so worried.

300
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,879
With Second Uncle by his side,

301
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,720
second Uncle will definitely help Leng.

302
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,200
Your Second Uncle?

303
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,120
What's wrong with my Second Uncle?

304
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Nothing.

305
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,759
Your brother and I are here,

306
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,320
that you were so carefree,

307
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,200
that's good.

308
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,559
She must be fine.

309
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,519
It's nothing.

310
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,080
Tell me now.

311
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,639
I'm part of the Mu family.

312
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,600
My brother and I would

313
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,120
with my brother.

314
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,440
It's not a big deal.

315
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,759
Your brother and sister-in-law

316
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,360
were they fighting?

317
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,879
Your sister-in-law was unhappy

318
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,559
and your brother

319
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,639
don't know how to calm him down.

320
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,399
Help your brother find a way.

321
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
How can I

322
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,799
leave it to me.

323
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
Little Su.

324
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,559
Why were you two fighting?

325
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,200
Will there be any misunderstanding?

326
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
I'll take this away.

327
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,159
Yes. Tell us about it.

328
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:18,759
We'll help you

329
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,960
to give you some advice.

330
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
It all comes down to

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,440
your stand and ideas are different.

332
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,279
I have nothing to say.

333
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,159
Go and pack your things.

334
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,600
I have never seen

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,879
to be so angry.

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,679
It seems that Mr. Mu

337
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,799
has really pissed her off.

338
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,720
So, why?

339
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you sure there is no

340
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,879
between you two?

341
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,480
And uncertain.

342
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
Well, I'm gonna have to sort out

343
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,159
hey.

344
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,759
Where did you put the documents

345
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,559
where is it?

346
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,440
Thanks.

347
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,720
Hey.

348
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,839
Hello, Mr. Mu?

349
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,200
Early this morning,

350
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,839
miss Su asked us to come

351
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,799
to pack up your things.

352
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,720
What did you do to her?

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,759
Here's the thing.

354
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,359
Yesterday,

355
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,640
we planned to celebrate

356
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,920
with our family.

357
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
But I have something urgent to attend to at the company,

358
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,440
so I haven't had time to go back with her.

359
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,400
Miss Su shouldn't be

360
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,720
be angry for such things.

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,359
Recently,

362
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,640
In order to give you a surprise,

363
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,079
she has been staying up all day

364
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,480
since childhood.

365
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,759
Forget about the hard work.

366
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,720
Laboratory

367
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,559
miss Su asked me to rent

368
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,559
for her

369
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,599
to study something

370
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,839
the mineral ring

371
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,279
from Yiliang Mountain.

372
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,920
He said he wanted to give you a gift.

373
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,279
Mr. Mu, hello?

374
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
Hello, Mr. Mu.

375
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,240
Hello, Mr. Mu?

376
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,519
Can you understand me?

377
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,599
I'm sorry. I really

378
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,720
to understand you.

379
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,480
I thought you really

380
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
about this.

381
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
But in fact,

382
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I know that

383
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,839
he thought I was blaming him

384
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,519
I was angry because

385
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,000
so he was angry because of his anniversary.

386
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,039
Yeah, according to him,

387
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,680
there must be

388
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,000
between the two of you.

389
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,920
Mr. Mu, you're here.

390
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,359
Sorry.

391
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,319
Sorry for what?

392
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,720
I...

393
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,400
I read the report

394
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,039
that you gave me.

395
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,240
I announced to return to work

396
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,839
because of the

397
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,839
the testing report

398
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,440
there is no new mineral in Yiliang Mountain.

399
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,759
Until now?

400
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
That's why.

401
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,680
Do you think

402
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,200
alright, it's not important.

403
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,640
Did you get that tested?

404
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,359
Where that thing came from.

405
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,839
That day, Xiaoman and I

406
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,400
met an employee of Mu's Group.

407
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,640
He made a ring for his wife

408
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
he made a ring for his wife.

409
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:33,839
Then I used

410
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,920
with my tutor's research report

411
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
In my lab.

412
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,200
The result

413
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,319
Is basically the same.

414
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,640
The probability of its contents being new

415
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
of its contents is up to 90%.

416
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,960
Someone who doesn't even trust

417
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,359
that doesn't trust his team

418
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,920
what will she lose?

419
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,240
It seems there's something wrong

420
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
really has problems.

421
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,599
We need to recheck it.

422
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
It was really a roller coaster

423
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,799
It was like the roller coaster.

424
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,400
I thought it was going to derail.

425
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,319
Luckily, your new report

426
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,799
I was back on track.

427
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,279
Thank you.

428
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,599
Didn't sleep well these two days

429
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
for these two days.

430
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,359
How about

431
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
let's redo it.

432
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
100th day anniversary.

433
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
Do whatever you want

434
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,839
you can do whatever you want.

435
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,759
Never mind, I forgive you.

436
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
That's enough.

437
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,240
Mr. Mu.

438
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,680
Mr. Mu had someone

439
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,000
to collect ore samples

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,160
to get rid of the ore samples.

441
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,799
Little jerk.

442
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,400
Won't you give up?

443
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,640
Hurry up!

444
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,759
Call a meeting with the directors.

445
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
Teach him something.

446
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,319
Yes

447
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,559
thank you, Mr. Mu.

448
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,920
I told you not to make it up.

449
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,480
You were being so mysterious at night.

450
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,400
What is she doing?

451
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,519
It suits you well.

452
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,440
Thank you.

453
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,200
I like it so much

454
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,759
do you still remember

455
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,000
the first dance we danced?

456
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,119
How can I forget?

457
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
But back then,

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you are not you.

459
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,920
So?

460
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,039
My name is Mu Huron.

461
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,759
My name is Su Jishi.

462
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,119
You're still as good at dancing as ever.

463
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,920
As always.

464
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,720
Doctor Su.

465
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,839
Hello, sister-in-law.

466
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,039
I'm going out now.

467
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,839
Have you made up with my brother?

468
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,599
Alright. Alright.

469
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,400
I won't be a third wheel.

470
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,200
See you later.

471
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,839
What?

472
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,559
They reconciled without any effort.

473
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,599
It seems that there's no big problem.

474
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,279
Gao Ling, my brother's crisis

475
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,319
Is over.

476
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,599
But as you,

477
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,279
as the punishment for telling you the truth.

478
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,559
Come out now

479
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,400
to have a date with me.

480
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll send you the address.

481
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,279
Sister-in-law is talking about Gao Ling.

482
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,079
She treated me like a sister.

483
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,880
We have to figure out a way

484
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
to make him realize

485
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,279
our relationship.

486
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,960
So sorry, miss.

487
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,319
I'm waiting for someone.

488
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
It's me.

489
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,559
A different style.

490
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
I didn't recognize you.

491
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,680
So do you like the person I was usually

492
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,759
or the person I'm today?

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,599
From now on,

494
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,759
the way you like.

495
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,799
Dress up however you like.

496
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,680
As you like.

497
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,599
Don't mind me.

498
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,400
But the air conditioning here

499
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Is kept low.

500
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,519
Come on.

501
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,319
Don't catch a cold.

502
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,039
What's wrong? What happened?

503
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,279
Don't treat me like a little girl.

504
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,440
You are not coaxing me or brushing me off.

505
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,759
Or I'll catch a cold.

506
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,960
Do you feel like caring a child

507
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,519
when you're with me?

508
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
How can I make you laugh?

509
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,039
I teased you. I was being perfunctory.

510
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,000
I was worried that you might catch a cold.

511
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,960
That you might catch a cold?

512
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
You just squeezed my face.

513
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,480
And when I

514
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
asking for your opinion,

515
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,799
I can dress up however I want.

516
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,839
I pinched your face

517
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,079
because I think you're cute.

518
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,359
So I can't help myself.

519
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,880
If you can't,

520
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,839
I won't hold it.

521
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,119
As for you,

522
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,200
what style do you like?

523
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,119
I think dressing is your freedom.

524
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,279
I don't have the right to interfere,

525
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,359
or control you.

526
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,839
What's more,

527
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,519
I like whatever you wear.

528
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,480
Really?

529
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,599
Why would I lie to you?

530
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,440
But other people's love lives...

531
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
Want to be with each other all the time.

532
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,559
Want to kiss and hug.

533
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't think you are like my boyfriend.

534
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,799
On the contrary, you look like my brother.

535
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,359
I won't let you

536
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,319
In the future.

537
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,319
This kind of clothing

538
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,759
Is only worn

539
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,119
when I'm by your side.

540
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,240
So I can protect you.

541
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,599
Got it?

542
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,559
Let's eat.

543
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,680
Just order.

544
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,519
You sent it

545
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,240
that you sent

546
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,559
the test report is here.

547
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,519
It's the same as the test result

548
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,519
that you showed me last time.

549
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,079
You mean that

550
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,559
the testing report given by the group

551
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,440
Is not fake.

552
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,960
Could it be the ore?

553
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:08,759
Second Uncle.

554
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,000
I admit I was

555
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
I was too stubborn.

556
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,799
And wasted

557
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,960
of the company's time

558
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,480
and manpower and material resources.

559
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm too naive.

560
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,799
What's this?

561
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,279
I'll tell you the truth.

562
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,759
I really didn't believe

563
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,119
I didn't believe the

564
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,839
the testing report issued by the group.

565
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,480
So they gave the ore sample

566
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
to a third party for re-testing.

567
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,599
But the result was

568
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,039
huron.

569
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
It's not too late

570
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,319
to realize it now.

571
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,480
Let's work together

572
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,240
to make Mu's Group better.

573
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,839
The project of Yiliang Mountain...

574
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,720
Has been neglected for so long.

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,960
Please take care of it in the future.

576
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,079
We are a family, what are you talking about?

577
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,359
Why are you here?

578
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:09,920
Second Uncle.

579
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,720
It's on my way home from work.

580
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,960
I'll pick Huron up.

581
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,759
OK, I will leave you two alone.

582
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,039
Goodbye, Second Uncle.

583
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,880
Come on, what are you doing?

584
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,720
What are you doing?

585
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,039
What are you talking about?

586
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,640
When I just arrived,

587
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,839
I saw him enter the door.

588
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,240
I heard them from the beginning to the end.

589
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,039
What did you mean by that?

590
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,400
They're literal.

591
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,720
Here is the thing.

592
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,359
I'll bring the group's ore samples

593
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,240
to him

594
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,880
head Zhang conducted a test.

595
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
But the result

596
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,279
Is same with

597
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,640
the test results issued by the Group.

598
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,039
There is no new mineral in Yiliang Mountain.

599
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,759
That's impossible.

600
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,240
You're acting, right?

601
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,599
Why am I acting?

602
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm not an actor.

603
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I know you don't like Second Uncle either.

604
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
But it's for the good of our company.

605
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
Under the circumstances,

606
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,240
and carry on,

607
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,119
I will lose

608
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,079
the President.

609
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,559
My father

610
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,680
was left to me by my dad

611
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,799
I want to protect it

612
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,920
with Xiaoman.

613
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's talk at home.

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,640
No need.

615
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
I've said all I can.

616
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll confirm this one last time.

617
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,200
Are you serious?

618
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,880
Confirm it ten times.

619
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
The result is the same.

620
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,319
I forgot that

621
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,240
you are the CEO of Mu's Group.

622
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,200
You are a businessman.

623
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,000
Forget what I said.

624
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,920
You came to my brother's house

625
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,200
for the movie?

626
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,079
Didn't you ask us to watch a movie?

627
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,759
I...

628
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,079
I plan to

629
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,839
to tell him about us earlier.

630
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,759
Then we could...

631
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,200
Openly in the future.

632
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,559
Let's go to

633
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,839
announce to my brother

634
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,960
what if he finds you hard?

635
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,920
I'll protect you.

636
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,319
Then I'll tell you

637
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,039
you were the one who shamelessly pursued me.

638
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,880
And then?

639
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,759
She reluctantly agreed.

640
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,640
They all look alike

641
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,839
cunning fox,

642
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,720
you kidnapped an innocent girl.

643
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,599
Alright.

644
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,240
Don't worry.

645
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,640
I will definitely try my best

646
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,039
to get his blessing.

647
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,839
You are back.

648
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:57,839
Brother.

649
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,279
Why are you back?

650
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,720
Nothing.

651
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,759
My brother and sister-in-law had a quarrel.

652
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,079
Officially stay here.

653
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,599
What?

654
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,920
The owner is not happy about it?

655
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,640
This was the last time

656
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
when my mentor came to China

657
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,960
we brought back during the expedition

658
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,759
he found the gold ore sample

659
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,440
the existence of

660
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,880
In the mineral samples.

661
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
Huron must be hiding something

662
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,719
keeping it from me?

663
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,519
There must be something wrong with the Yiliang mine.

664
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,199
I can't. I have to figure out

665
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,639
be careful!

666
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,599
Are you alright?

667
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,039
Yes, I'm fine.

668
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,119
Let's go. I'll carry it to you.

669
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,000
This is for Leng.

670
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,039
I

671
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,559
I wanted to investigate the situation.

672
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,400
And mediate the situation

673
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,239
my sister-in-law and him

674
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,320
and make peace soon.

675
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,039
Be careful, don't burn yourself.

676
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,679
I'm leaving now.

677
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,480
You're going on vacation?

678
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,079
Second Uncle,

679
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,840
I also know that

680
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,119
the Yiliangshan Project has just been restarted.

681
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,320
There are a lot of things to do.

682
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,159
However,

683
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,039
with your girlfriend again?

684
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,039
Don't

685
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,119
I told you long ago that

686
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,039
to date an actress?

687
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,000
Not overdo sth

688
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,199
that's enough.

689
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,199
You are serious.

690
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,079
It's both sad and harmful.

691
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,159
Why bother?

692
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,599
Xiaoyu, I made the coffee in person.

693
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,719
Xiaoman,

694
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
second Uncle.

695
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,360
I didn't come to your brother's place

696
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,159
I can't see you either.

697
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,079
And you won't visit me.

698
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,679
You came at the right time.

699
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
Your brother goes on leave a few days later

700
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,440
to keep him company.

701
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,000
That's great. No problem.

702
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,920
Xiaoman has to work, Second Uncle.

703
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,800
What work?

704
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,159
You're not going to

705
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,960
In this state?

706
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,039
She happens to be in the president's office

707
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,199
to take care of you. It's my duty.

708
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Brother, just let me go.

709
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,679
You know that, Second Uncle.

710
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,159
Xiaoman won't take care of others.

711
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,760
I will have to take care of her then.

712
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,440
With Gao Ling?

713
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,920
He's in charge of your life,

714
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
and I'll be responsible for your mood.

715
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,400
Xiaoman, this is a good idea.

716
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,360
It's decided then.

717
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,840
OK. We'll follow your instructions.

718
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,280
I'll tell Gao Ling then.

719
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,360
Alright.

720
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,880
During my absence,

721
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,920
the company's Second Uncle

722
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,760
thank you.

723
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
It's only her family that says so.

724
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,039
Don't worry about me.

725
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,599
Get ready.

726
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,000
Xiaoman and I will go to Yi Liang tomorrow.

727
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,519
Yi Liang?

728
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,360
Going to the mine.

729
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,480
I'll explain the details

730
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,599
I'll tell you the details later.

731
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,119
The destination is a secret to Xiaoman first.

732
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,000
Gao Ling,

733
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,039
I have something to tell you.

734
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,880
Which one do you want to hear

735
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,079
or the bad?

736
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:41,199
There's always good news and bad news.

737
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,719
Let me hear the good news first.

738
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
The good news is

739
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,679
you don't have to work tomorrow.

740
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,079
And accompany Mr. Mu on vacation.

741
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,639
And the bad news?

742
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,119
The bad news is

743
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,960
this time,

744
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,280
I have a mission to do.

745
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,599
I can't be with you.

746
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:04,920
What do you want to do?

747
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,800
I need to talk to my brother.

748
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,280
Don't worry.

749
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,679
To promote our relationship

750
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,360
to the world as soon as possible.

751
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,079
I will try my best

752
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,440
to solve the problem.

753
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,800
You are responsible for this operation.

754
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,679
Watch Xiaoman closely.

755
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,679
Don't let her find me.

756
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,280
Xiaoman.

757
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,000
Gao Ling, don't stop me.

758
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,320
I'm going upstairs to see my brother.

759
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,199
Your brother said he wanted to be alone.

760
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,599
Let's not disturb him then.

761
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,679
But I am here

762
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,800
Is to convince my brother

763
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
and solve their problem.

764
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,800
To solve their problems.

765
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,400
I know the truth about

766
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,360
your brother and your sister-in-law.

767
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,880
I'll be fine in a few days.

768
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,280
Really?

769
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,599
Why would I lie to you?

770
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,400
Your brother specially told me

771
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,000
to keep you company.

772
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,960
Leave him alone.

773
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,000
All right.

774
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,639
This is our first trip

775
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,760
since we started dating.

776
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,119
I've arranged a lot of projects.

777
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,599
I was supposed to accompany my brother.

778
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,440
But now it's kind of exciting

779
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,760
Is a bit exciting.

780
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,239
So what are you waiting for?

781
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,639
It's just one day.

782
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,920
I'll stay with my brother tomorrow.

783
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,840
We have several

784
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,239
classic hiking routes.

785
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,880
Many mountain climbers come here

786
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,599
be attracted to a place by its reputation as a scenic spot

787
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,840
that's why the resort has

788
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,079
mountaineering manuals

789
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:39,920
there's a route map

790
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,639
you can refer to it.

791
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,599
You can have a look

792
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,719
If you have any problems,

793
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,880
you can also consult me.

794
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,079
Thank you.

795
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,159
Are you going to this mining site as well?

796
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,960
What does this mean?

797
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,880
The other client who consulted me today

798
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
also drew this circle on the map.

799
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,559
What kind of guests

800
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,559
a guy or a girl?

801
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,639
You two

802
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,679
finally come out.

803
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,400
No, I don't go out by myself

804
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,480
take a walk.

805
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,440
Keeps following me.

806
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,639
Am I supposed to fly?

807
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,960
Miss Su, Mr. Mu.

808
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,519
I told you not to mention him.

809
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,400
Well, look at this.

810
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,719
You're going to the mine tomorrow?

811
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:22,920
Mr. Mu, what do you mean?

812
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,599
I cannot understand

813
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,760
do you understand?

814
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,599
We don't understand.

815
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,400
No?

816
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,000
Let's go then.

817
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,400
Let's talk for a minute.

818
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,039
Who said anything about talking to you?

819
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:32,519
Put me down.

820
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,719
Fang Xie,

821
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,559
mr. Mu.

822
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,239
It's good to talk.

823
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,519
Just talk nicely.

824
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,320
Mr. Mu, open the door.

825
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,800
Let go of me.

826
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,920
I know you are here

827
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
to get the ore samples.

828
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,719
Me too.

829
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,719
- Mr. Mu. - Open the door.

830
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,880
Stop quarreling.

831
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,280
Sorry.

832
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:54,440
Didn't you say that

833
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,400
the test report

834
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,199
Is no problem?

835
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,079
The report is clean.

836
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,079
It doesn't mean the ore sample

837
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:58,840
then it won't be a problem.

838
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,000
I suspect that

839
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,239
the institute

840
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,679
the ore samples we contacted before

841
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,480
are all fake.

842
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,119
Yiliang Mountain is remote.

843
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,440
She doesn't pay attention to management usually.

844
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,159
I guess the staff nearby

845
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,599
have all been bribed

846
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,599
bribed by Second Uncle.

847
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,159
The reason we quarreled with you that day

848
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,760
because Second Uncle was nearby.

849
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:14,840
So,

850
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,239
I wanted to perform for him

851
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,559
and made him think

852
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,679
I'd given up mineral research,

853
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,039
then I can come here

854
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:21,760
to sample it myself.

855
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,519
Why didn't you tell me at the time?

856
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,119
When you gave me a look,

857
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:25,960
when you showed me your eyes.

858
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,440
I was worried that you'd be anxious,

859
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
that you wouldn't cooperate.

860
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,559
What about when you went home?

861
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
You didn't explain to me.

862
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,599
Would I be worried

863
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,400
the safety of my girlfriend

864
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,199
that's not right either.

865
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,639
I initially wanted to

866
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,760
to come back

867
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,199
with the samples in the end.

868
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,280
Please give me some time.

869
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,400
I will definitely give you

870
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,199
a satisfying answer.

871
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,880
I don't know

872
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,280
which word of you I should believe.

873
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,480
If everything goes well,

874
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,199
I should be able to get

875
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,440
the ore sample tomorrow.

876
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
What if it doesn't work out?

877
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,039
That it'll work?

878
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,039
Get the samples?

879
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,440
I only believe

880
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,679
the samples I got

881
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,639
from the field at the mine.

882
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:01,960
The mine is very secure.

883
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,320
It's too dangerous if you go alone.

884
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
I have tons of

885
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
In the field.

886
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,199
And I won't

887
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,480
to get inside the mine.

888
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:08,800
If they are all like this,

889
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
If you insist not to let me go,

890
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,599
I can only choose

891
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,639
to believe what you're saying.

892
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,400
The two of us go together,

893
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,320
or I'll go alone.

894
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,559
Can you stop me?

895
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,840
Xiao Xia,

896
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,159
whose side are you on?

897
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,519
I'm definitely with you.

898
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,480
That's why we will never let you

899
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,760
adventure in the mountains.

900
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,280
What? You want to escape?

901
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,599
You know what?

902
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,960
If something bad happens to you,

903
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,559
I will not tell Jinqing.

904
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,280
Xiaoxia and I will be on shift

905
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,679
on tonight.

906
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,719
Don't you try to escape.

907
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,320
Mu Huron.

908
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,079
Do you have to

909
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,119
to do such a thing?

910
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,239
I will definitely bring the samples back.

911
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,079
I promise.
