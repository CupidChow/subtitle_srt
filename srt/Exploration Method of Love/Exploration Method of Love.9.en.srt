1
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,040
This is for you.

2
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,439
You won't be able to finish them for me?

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,799
Since when does she

4
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,760
has such a small appetite?

5
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
How could you eat more?

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
What's wrong with you recently?

7
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,360
If you can't finish it,

8
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
then don't buy so many.

9
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,120
It's really

10
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,800
♪ Love or not ♪

11
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,680
Luckily, I can eat.

12
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,120
Why didn't I see Gaoling before?

13
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,479
It looks like the hero in a novel.

14
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,319
What are you doing, Mu Xiaoman?

15
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you doing?

16
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
I need to go out.

17
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,479
Someone is here. Please handle it for me.

18
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,719
Alright.

19
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
Mu Xiaoman,

20
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,240
what's on your mind?

21
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,639
Will you fall in love again in the amusement park?

22
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,680
I can't.

23
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,560
I have to go and verify

24
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
have you been waiting long?

25
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,639
Tell me, you're not the only one.

26
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,319
You made me come here.

27
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm busy right now.

28
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,759
That Gao Ling

29
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,639
he even came to the company.

30
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,839
Gao Ling, what are you doing?

31
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,160
Are you interested in

32
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,839
physical therapy?

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm the new therapist

34
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
physical rehabilitation therapist upstairs.

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,079
You can come to me if you need any.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Come on.

37
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,399
Go on.

38
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,079
How should I explain it to Gao Ling?

39
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,079
Such an embarrassing situation.

40
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,439
Spill it.

41
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,439
What happened just now?

42
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,000
Just passed by.

43
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,879
Are you passing by?

44
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
What a coincidence.

45
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,199
Hey,

46
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,560
It reminds me that Ya from the R & D Department

47
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,759
asked me to work.

48
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,800
I'll go to work.

49
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,920
Do I really

50
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,639
fall in love with him?

51
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,959
What are his thoughts?

52
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,639
Call it even?

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
It was just a kiss.

54
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,879
What is it, boss?

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,319
What should I say?

56
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,480
It seems you are ashamed to say it.

57
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,720
Private...

58
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,160
And official business.

59
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,680
Here's the thing.

60
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,079
A client who has

61
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,800
who has always been

62
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
In the mine

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,959
In the mine.

64
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,920
They have started exploiting it without permission.

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,560
This is an illegal occupation

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,480
our property.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,519
I'll contact the lawyer.

68
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,079
Hold on.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,040
I volunteered.

70
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,720
Go on,

71
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,480
after she finished mining,

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,000
they just sat there and didn't dig any deeper.

73
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,519
I wouldn't let others

74
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,959
for nothing, right?

75
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,079
Then,

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,759
I tried to exploit her

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,959
but now

78
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,079
she suddenly kicked me

79
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,920
out of her mine.

80
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,560
What do you think she means?

81
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,759
So you mean that

82
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,519
you are willing to let her exploit you?

83
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,360
But it seems like she's completely

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,839
to let you mine it at all.

85
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,399
It's impossible.

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
If she doesn't want to,

87
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
she wouldn't touch me

88
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
to mine.

89
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,120
Mr. Mu,

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
a girl's mind

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,959
It's totally different from mining.

92
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,800
You can't use this

93
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
with this.

94
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,560
Then what does she mean?

95
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,879
About girls?

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm talking about clients.

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Business competition

98
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
a business competition

99
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,600
are boring.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,839
Naturally, the clients will feel

101
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,680
nothing to fear

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,720
If you trust me,

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,800
you can leave this matter

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,480
to me.

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Mr. Mu, the thing is...

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,319
This is Secretary Gao.

107
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,600
Your interpreter.

108
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,959
What do you mean?

109
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,240
Mr. Mu,

110
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,839
this is the strategy I told you.

111
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,319
Some strategies

112
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,199
may seem unreliable,

113
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,360
and even dramatic.

114
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
It's true

115
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,360
are the best.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Mr. Mu.

117
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,279
Welcome to our company.

118
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,639
I thought I'd see you

119
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,399
where's Miss Su?

120
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,480
Recently Miss Su has been

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,279
through her personal charm,

122
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,000
and win them all.

123
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,480
Among the netizens.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
You have good taste, Mr. Mu.

125
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,319
It's a pity.

126
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,000
Little Jin can't come

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,879
can't come today.

128
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,360
It's nice of you to come here

129
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,279
that's very kind of you.

130
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,480
Come on. This way, please.

131
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,560
Secretary Gao.

132
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,480
What should we do?

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
We'll act accordingly.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Don't forget your mission.

135
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,519
Isn't this just a movie opening banquet?

136
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,960
Does it need to be so exquisite?

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
That's for sure.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Although it's just for a month,

139
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,559
but it's still Director Zhang's movie.

140
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,639
Everyone is watching it.

141
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,080
What's more,

142
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,759
this new movie

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,039
It has Xu Yadan again.

144
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,759
Also,

145
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,080
since you released the news

146
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,120
to shoot for the cover?

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,639
All parties

148
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,840
cares about your look.

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Brother Fang.

150
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,679
Little Su,

151
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,720
two sets of formal dresses.

152
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,320
Which one?

153
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,919
The black one.

154
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,279
I'll go press them.

155
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,679
Brother Fang,

156
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,480
when I came here just now,

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,519
I thought it was very lively over there.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,559
There's a business dinner nearby.

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,679
Those who were here

160
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,519
mining industry bosses.

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Wasn't Mr. Mu there too?

162
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,320
It was impossible.

163
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,720
Over the years, if we had

164
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,480
business dinner,

165
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
secretary Gao will inform us

166
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,799
Immediately.

167
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,080
Ask Xiaojin to set aside a slot.

168
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,919
I didn't receive any news today.

169
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,679
Deal with your hair.

170
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,039
Right.

171
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
Miss Su.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,279
Why are you here?

173
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,879
Mr. Mu is next door

174
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,679
has a new girlfriend.

175
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,159
That's impossible.

176
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,399
I wasn't lying, right?

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,200
Look at Mr. Mu.

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,159
How affectionate her eyes are!

179
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,320
I heard from everyone here that

180
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
their behavior

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
In a very intimate way.

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
The first picture.

183
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,799
The content is made up entirely.

184
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,679
It's boring.

185
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,679
Someone's in there.

186
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,440
Took photos for you.

187
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,159
Didn't anyone tell you that

188
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,120
that Mu Hurun

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,879
went with another man

190
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,639
because they respect me so highly.

191
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,159
Don't you want to affect my schedule?

192
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,600
Take care.

193
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,000
Take your phone.

194
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,639
Mr. Mu, what's the situation?

195
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,039
Does he really have a new girlfriend?

196
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,519
He has never

197
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,559
with no one else.

198
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,720
Not to mention in public places like this.

199
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,759
Then in private,

200
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,039
besides Xiao Jin,

201
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,200
Is Ms. Mu.

202
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Today is the first day of my life.

203
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,559
But that makes sense.

204
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,799
We have a schedule today.

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,399
To change my dress.

206
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,279
I'm going to take a look.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,799
Alright.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,399
Hey.

209
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,200
Why are you going there?

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
You don't have the invitation.

211
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,679
It's my face.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Do I need the invitation?

213
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll leave you two to talk.

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,799
See you later.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,440
This is Mr. Zhang from the South Group.

216
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,679
He also wants to get to know you.

217
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,279
Hello

218
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,720
thank you very much.

219
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,159
Cheers, cheers!

220
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,320
President Chen.

221
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,759
Mr. Mu.

222
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,320
The Mining Summit

223
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,200
was a great success.

224
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,000
Sorry, Miss Su.

225
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,440
Please show me your invitation.

226
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
We don't have

227
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,000
we don't have an invitation.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,039
We can't let you in without the invitation.

229
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,519
How dare you not let her in,

230
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,960
how dare you refuse to let her in?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
She is the super star

232
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,759
a top star.

233
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,080
Why are you here?

234
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,919
I just passed by.

235
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,519
Just passed by?

236
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,960
What a coincidence.

237
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,240
The hall next door

238
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,559
Is our activity place.

239
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,039
So it's not such a coincidence.

240
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,639
Mr. Mu.

241
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,320
Mr. Allen is looking for you.

242
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,519
Mr. Mu, get back to work.

243
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,480
I'll leave first.

244
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,039
Let go of him.

245
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,320
If you don't, tomorrow...

246
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,519
Go to E State and...

247
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,200
Don't you want to

248
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,559
thinking about the client?

249
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,000
If you go there now,

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,279
all your previous efforts will be wasted.

251
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,440
Nice to meet you.

252
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,320
You'd better pray

253
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
your inexplicable methods

254
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
will work.

255
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,039
Don't worry.

256
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,279
Leave it to me.

257
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,720
Come on.

258
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,440
Is anyone following us?

259
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,840
Don't worry.

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,480
There's no fan at all.

261
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,960
They've already entered.

262
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:36,840
Fang Xie,

263
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,559
send me a lawyer's letter now

264
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
to warn Mr. Mu that

265
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,559
he should have told us

266
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,919
before doing such things.

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,360
That his actions

268
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840
has affected my reputation.

269
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,240
Hey.

270
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,799
Mr. Mu, today

271
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,840
the new female companion

272
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,000
It really has something to do with him.

273
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,480
It's not that.

274
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,320
Little Su.

275
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,519
At this moment, I can really understand

276
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,360
your anger.

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,399
But we should

278
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,320
I will send Mr. Mu a lawyer's letter now.

279
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,679
It would seem that we were too impulsive

280
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,799
and acted in haste.

281
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,159
That would make Mr. Mu think...

282
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,679
Think what?

283
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,720
I felt that...

284
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,720
You care too much about her.

285
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,559
Apparently jealous.

286
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,919
Of him?

287
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,919
I didn't say anything.

288
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,039
You know what?

289
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,000
My mother...

290
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,759
Called me a serial killer

291
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,480
from five o'clock in the morning.

292
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,720
She even said that

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,919
she wanted to cut ties with me.

294
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,159
The netizens

295
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
bombarded

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,759
on all social media.

297
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,600
Even I don't use them for 8 centuries.

298
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,159
My personal Weibo account is in trouble.

299
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,000
What do you think we should do?

300
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,679
Do you want to clarify it?

301
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,480
You still think this matter

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
not serious enough?

303
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,399
You should clarify it yourself.

304
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,159
Read it out.

305
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,039
Mu Hulun, you scumbag.

306
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,879
It's better not to come out and explain

307
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,200
In front of everyone.

308
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
To explain is to cover up.

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
A cover-up is the truth.

310
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't believe a word of it.

311
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,799
I don't believe a word either.

312
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,840
What are you doing?

313
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
Why do you have to

314
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,799
cuckold her?

315
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
I just wanted to

316
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,759
to test Miss Su's thinking.

317
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,200
Did you try it out?

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,919
Did you try to find it?

319
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,159
Miss Su is so unfathomable.

320
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,919
Brother.

321
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,320
If I were you,

322
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,879
make it clear with her right away.

323
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,279
Will she mind it?

324
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,879
Time to eat.

325
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,039
My phone ran out of battery.

326
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,679
She lent me a message.

327
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,879
Luckily she didn't see the phone.

328
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,480
It's bad for digestion.

329
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,000
Xia,

330
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,320
this is the fifth time

331
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
you've used all kinds of strange excuses

332
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,279
to stop me checking my phone?

333
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,559
What on earth

334
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,519
see what?

335
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,919
I don't want you to be sad.

336
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
That's good.

337
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,519
Give it to me.

338
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,039
Give it to me.

339
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,120
I didn't expect that

340
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,759
that you're someone like Mr. Mu.

341
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
Cry if you want to.

342
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,240
You can always

343
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,759
you can always rely on.

344
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,960
But it's not that serious.

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
Mu Hulun, you're really something.

346
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,279
And that Xu Yadan.

347
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,080
She didn't slide at all.

348
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,720
She's just taking advantage of the popularity.

349
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:54,960
Then I'm going to be

350
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,039
with the plastic sisters

351
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,519
with each other.

352
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,279
Miss Su.

353
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,559
Let's go to the scene.

354
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,120
Alright.

355
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Come on.

356
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,519
Action.

357
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,440
It seems that Little Su

358
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,039
Is really sad now.

359
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,879
But to numb myself

360
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,120
to numb myself.

361
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,720
Little Jin.

362
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
Why did you lock me up?

363
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,120
My hand was to blame.

364
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,519
It slipped.

365
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,279
I didn't mean to like you on Weibo.

366
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,919
The relationship between you and Mr. Mu on Weibo.

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,279
Uggo is making troubles. You can't be so stingy, right?

368
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,919
Of course, I won't.

369
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,600
But if

370
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
that you always slide your hands,

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,039
I can introduce a doctor to you

372
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,279
to see if you have Parkinson's disease.

373
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,039
He is old after all.

374
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,320
So you should pay more attention.

375
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
Please

376
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,279
come on, get ready.

377
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,080
One, two, three, run!

378
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,120
It's dangerous! Don't go!

379
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,840
Let go of me.

380
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
The card.

381
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,919
Jadan.

382
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,319
Your hand

383
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,480
don't hold it so tightly.

384
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,039
The same as when we were in the scene.

385
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,319
Sorry, director.

386
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,000
I was too immersed in the drama.

387
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,640
Sorry, Xiao Jin.

388
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,480
Let's have another one.

389
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,359
I should blame your poor acting skills.

390
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,079
Or revenge?

391
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,440
Come on, Director.

392
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,279
Action!

393
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,599
It's dangerous. Don't go.

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
Let go of me!

395
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
Little Su, watch out!

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Miss Su.

397
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,759
Be careful

398
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,240
mr Su.

399
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
Little Su, are you alright?

400
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,960
Are you all right?

401
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,960
Go check on Miss Su.

402
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,559
See if Miss Su is okay.

403
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,400
Got it.

404
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,519
Little Su.

405
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,200
I will ask Shan

406
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,240
to take you to the hospital.

407
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,759
Don't make a fuss. I'm fine.

408
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
You call this nothing?

409
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
How are you, Xiao Jin?

410
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,680
Are you all right?

411
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,799
Yes, Director.

412
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,599
That's good.

413
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,559
Mr. Mu, what brought you here?

414
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,599
If I hadn't come,

415
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,079
how would I know?

416
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
My fiancée is

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,759
with such an unprofessional actor.

418
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Miss Xu.

419
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,880
Please be professional next time.

420
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,480
As her fiancé,

421
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,519
I can't interfere with anything.

422
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,279
But if the next time,

423
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,279
I guess the director would

424
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,960
I suggest we change the actor.

425
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,519
I...

426
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,160
Mr. Mu.

427
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,359
Please take Mr. Su to the hospital.

428
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll take Xiaojin with me today.

429
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,759
Come on.

430
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:48,640
Isn't Muhurun

431
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
has a new lover?

432
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,880
Why do you still defend her?

433
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,200
Mr. Mu, no need.

434
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,319
You're stubborn in this case.

435
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,119
Let me send you to the hospital

436
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,960
to get it checked.

437
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,079
I told you I'm fine.

438
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,279
And if I go to the hospital,

439
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,200
and I don't know what the news will say.

440
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,519
Let me send you home.

441
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,359
Let's go then.

442
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,799
Xiao Xia said she

443
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,839
she won't be back for now.

444
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,799
I'll find some safflower oil

445
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,359
for you there?

446
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,200
Got it.

447
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll help you.

448
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,039
Does it hurt?

449
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,240
It's fine.

450
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Hold your horses.

451
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,079
Why do you

452
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,519
so stubborn?

453
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,920
Don't you have anything to ask me?

454
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,319
I'm only Party B.

455
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,519
What's there to ask?

456
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,119
I thought you would ask me

457
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,960
why I suddenly

458
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,880
at the scene suddenly?

459
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,519
Is Mr. Mu's private business.

460
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,880
By the way, Mr. Mu,

461
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,160
I need to remind you that

462
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,559
It doesn't matter that you have a new lover,

463
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,920
or find a new partner.

464
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,400
Shouldn't I

465
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,160
Inform our team

466
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,119
Inform us beforehand?

467
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,200
Not to cause

468
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,119
unnecessary troubles to each other.

469
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,680
This is the premise of our cooperation.

470
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,279
Alright.

471
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Troubled her.

472
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
He must be jealous.

473
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,160
You say you don't care.

474
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,079
Thank you.

475
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,960
If there's nothing else,

476
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,119
you may as well go back.

477
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,039
If I get photographed

478
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,720
If I go out now and get photographed,

479
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
today's news will become a reality.

480
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,799
But what's on the photo

481
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,319
holding him that day.

482
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,119
And Miss Su has learned

483
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,480
look at the picture and talk.

484
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,680
I only believe what I see.

485
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,119
That's just a female translator.

486
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,079
Furthermore,

487
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,720
that's Gao Ling's decision.

488
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,920
Make the arrangements for me.

489
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
I didn't know until I arrived.

490
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,119
I promise that

491
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,079
this won't happen

492
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,519
will not happen again.

493
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,000
What I meant was

494
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,440
have caused the trouble

495
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
It's really unnecessary.

496
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
Those news

497
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,519
solve it yourself.

498
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
Our team doesn't care about it.

499
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,920
They are now cooled down.

500
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,160
Hey!

501
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,279
Brother.

502
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,000
Did you apologize to her?

503
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,640
Was your wife very angry?

504
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,119
Tell her

505
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,000
xiaoman.

506
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,480
Hey.

507
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,000
Sister-in-law.

508
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,279
These are all

509
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,359
these are stupid ideas.

510
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,079
Don't be mad at him.

511
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,799
My mother just called,

512
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,240
and scolding my brother.

513
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,000
Really?

514
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,440
If you're still angry,

515
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,119
you can make my brother suffer.

516
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,359
Don't let him off

517
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,440
so easily.

518
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:04,960
That Mu Xiaoman...

519
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,039
You can hang up now.

520
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,160
Why don't you let Xiaoman finish?

521
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,880
The one who betrayed my brother.

522
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
There's nothing to talk about with her.

523
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,960
But I think what she said

524
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,720
makes a good point.

525
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,160
It seems that I'll have to ask her

526
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,559
I have to ask her carefully.

527
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,119
What she can do to you.

528
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,039
It seems that I have to avoid

529
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,799
see each other again.

530
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:28,640
Everything is fine.

531
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
Why does it start raining suddenly?

532
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,240
Hello, Brother Gao Ling.

533
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,799
It's suddenly raining outside.

534
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,359
Could you send me an umbrella?

535
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,519
I'm at the square on Pyeongchang Road.

536
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,880
Xiaoman.

537
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,319
Brother Gao Ling,

538
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,000
I rushed here after receiving the call.

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
Make do with my clothes.

540
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,599
Take this.

541
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,319
To find a shelter.

542
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,359
I'll buy an umbrella.

543
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:16,880
Wait for me.

544
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,359
The person I love

545
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,400
doesn't have to stand on the colorful clouds.

546
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,839
You'd come to me with an umbrella.

547
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:56,960
I asked you

548
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,920
to find a shelter.

549
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,680
Get out of the trance!

550
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,079
Your head is wet.

551
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,759
Brother Gao Ling, my heart beats so fast.

552
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,799
I seem to have a crush on you.

553
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,880
Don't joke about it.

554
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm not joking about it.

555
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,119
During this period, as long as I got close to you,

556
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:21,799
I felt my heart

557
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,359
my heartbeats are thumping.

558
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,960
Stop it.

559
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,680
We've known each other for over ten years.

560
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,200
How can he just like her?

561
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Who can tell?

562
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
There are no rules to love.

563
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
My heart beats faster when I see you.

564
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,039
No one

565
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,960
who he'll fall in love with

566
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
who you'll fall in love with in advance.

567
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,839
Let's pretend you never said that.

568
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
Brother Gao Ling.

569
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm serious.

570
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,680
I really fell in love with you.

571
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,880
I heard from Xiao Xia.

572
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
This Xu Yadan

573
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,000
he always does some tricks

574
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,519
be careful when you shoot in the future.

575
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Nothing serious.

576
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,119
Her tricks

577
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,359
with her little actions.

578
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,440
Luckily, Mr. Mu was there today.

579
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,759
Otherwise, she would have to keep acting.

580
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,640
I saw the photos online.

581
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
Mr. Mu has brought you home.

582
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,000
It really scared me.

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
With the news today,

584
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,079
I thought you and Mr. Mu

585
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,200
were doomed.

586
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,319
I've been busy with the whole morning.

587
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,640
A PR letter of your breakup.

588
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Are you home now?

589
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,920
I'll check on you.

590
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,519
No.

591
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,599
Don't come.

592
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,680
Why not?

593
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,839
I'll take the medicine to see you.

594
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,000
Don't leave any scars.

595
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I've applied some medicine.

596
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,680
What's more,

597
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,359
I'm ready to

598
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,920
to bed now.

599
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,039
So that's it?

600
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,680
= Just hang up the phone = Got it. Bye-bye.

601
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,680
What?

602
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,160
It's so strange.

603
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Could it be...

604
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Mr. Mu was there.

605
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
Thank you, Mr. Mu, for taking care of the patient.

606
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,200
For the patient.

607
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,559
Here's to you, patient.

608
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,359
Are you sure you want to drink?

609
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,759
That's not your limit.

610
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,799
Also,

611
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,920
the wine is mediocre.

612
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,799
What about the last time?

613
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,799
It was an accident.

614
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,880
This will never happen again

615
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,839
In the future.

616
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,519
Congratulations.

617
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,559
Mr. Mu. It's done successfully.

618
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,480
The company's business

619
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,680
thank you.

620
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,920
Drink slowly.

621
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,799
The alcohol is strong.

622
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
Don't worry.

623
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I can drink more.

624
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Is not as bad as you think.

625
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
Slowly.

626
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,200
Am I drunk?

627
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,359
Don't look down on me.

628
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
With your drinking capacity,

629
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,200
you should stop drinking.

630
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,640
I...

631
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,319
I can drink much.

632
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,000
How is it worse?

633
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
There's something wrong with your wine.

634
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,359
When I was drinking with my buddies

635
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,599
when I was drinking outside,

636
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,480
no matter how much I drank,

637
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,440
I will never get drunk.

638
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,079
What kind of friend are you?

639
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,599
That's right.

640
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,319
Those who want to

641
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,599
with me.

642
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,759
We'll catch scorpions together

643
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,839
to look at minerals.

644
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,200
You were really drunk.

645
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
And you began to talk nonsense.

646
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,000
I, Su Jishi,

647
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
I never talk nonsense.

648
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Did you just say that...

649
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,599
What's your name?

650
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,359
I said my name is Su Jishi.

651
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,119
Not Su Jin.

652
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,960
What did you just say?

653
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,519
I need to take a shower.

654
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,200
Hey.

655
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,720
You can drink it.

656
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,599
Stop messing around when you're drunk.

657
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,920
You're really drunk.

658
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,000
You may catch a cold.

659
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
Stop it.

660
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,480
I think I'm falling in love with you.

661
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,119
Mu Huron.

662
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm going to breach the contract.

663
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,359
It's broken.

664
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,720
Mu Hurun, are you a household servant?

665
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,640
Not bad. It smells good.

666
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,039
The information is similar to her current self.

667
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,359
How come it's so complicated?

668
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,240
It was given by Su Jin's agent

669
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
from her agent?

670
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,599
Why did you find this?

671
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,480
Don't you want to prescribe the right remedy

672
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,599
and courageously pursue your wife?

673
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,960
The iron tree that has been standing for 30 years

674
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Is finally going to bloom.

675
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,519
How's the preparation for the forum going?

676
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,960
I've contacted Binnam University.

677
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,119
We can just attend it then.

678
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,720
She doesn't eat preserved eggs, right?

679
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,839
Let me ask you something.

680
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,720
If you have feelings for someone,

681
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,279
lie to her?

682
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,880
Of course not.

683
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,559
I think honesty

684
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,880
Is important in a relationship.

685
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,319
Then let's say you have a

686
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,079
you can't tell,

687
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,680
my secret?

688
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,880
Is this some kind of workplace test?

689
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,640
Mr. Mu, rest assured.

690
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
I'm very tight-lipped

691
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,079
trade secrets.

692
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,400
I mean those that are unrelated

693
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,759
that have nothing to do with business.

694
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,039
There won't be any secret.

695
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,279
If that's the case,

696
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,279
I think she wants to share

697
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,839
to share everything.

698
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,319
What if you're hiding everything?

699
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,079
It only means that you don't like him enough.

700
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
Didn't Xiaoman

701
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,359
anything to you?

702
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,640
To Xiaoman, this...

703
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,480
What's wrong with Xiaoman?

704
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:11,880
Nothing.

705
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,880
You suddenly talked about love.

706
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,599
I thought

707
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,480
has some relationship problems again.

708
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Do me a favor.

709
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,960
Check Su Jin's family background,

710
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,799
Including her parents

711
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,279
and family,

712
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,039
If there are any siblings

713
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,480
to start with

714
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,720
from their relatives.

715
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,759
Look into it as you want.

716
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,880
Cut the crap!

717
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,599
I will certainly

718
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,000
and check her family.

719
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,960
To make you marry the girl soon.

720
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,319
Don't let anyone know about this.

721
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,400
Got it.

722
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,599
There's an urgent matter

723
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,240
to deal with.

724
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,839
Can I use your computer?

725
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,799
Thank you.

726
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,799
Thesis of geology.

727
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,400
I used to work with

728
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,920
when I was

729
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,160
when we were drinking outside,

730
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,119
no matter how much I drank,

731
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,039
I couldn't get drunk.

732
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
I said my name is Su Jishi,

733
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,119
no Su Jin.

734
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,440
Su Jin?

735
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,519
Who the hell are you?

736
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,359
You never allowed me to have porridge.

737
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,119
To eat

738
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,039
the preserved egg and meat.

739
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,160
No way.

740
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,079
You've drunk more than half a bowl.

741
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:37,680
You can't drink any more.

742
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
It's a shame to waste food.

743
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,519
Don't you know

744
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,480
little Su, you used to

745
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I thought you didn't eat preserved eggs.

746
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,359
It's...

747
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,559
Everyone changes.

748
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,400
Right?

749
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,440
Besides, your Little Su

750
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,319
has been eating grass

751
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,200
for two years.

752
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,200
Every time we have meat or fish, she'll be greedy.

753
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Let's get straight to business.

754
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,559
Zhenzhen Magazine has

755
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,640
has made us a few plans

756
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
for us to choose from.

757
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,079
The first plan

758
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,559
you are the mermaid sleeping

759
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,720
sleeping in the shell.

760
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,039
Innocent and enchanting

761
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
you can look cute

762
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,280
and sensuality of a mature woman.

763
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,400
Next.

764
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,880
Am I some kind of Disney princess?

765
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,239
The second one then.

766
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,079
You're an elf

767
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,800
that lives in the primeval jungle.

768
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
Inhabit in the mountains,

769
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,880
clever, mysterious and alert.

770
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,719
Who wears a bikini

771
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,719
In the wild?

772
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,840
Next one.

773
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,400
No, there won't be.

774
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,840
How come there's no next?

775
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,639
Isn't there a third one?

776
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,639
I can't do this.

777
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,440
Why not?

778
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,960
I really can't do that.

779
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,159
That's not how you break through

780
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,440
go overboard then.

781
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,039
Do you think that with mermaids and

782
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,360
and bikini elves

783
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,360
we'll be able to crush

784
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,320
the gentlemanly style and Xu Yadan?

785
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,719
Is it really impossible?

786
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,320
If you think the first two are not good enough,

787
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
I'll let them think about other things.

788
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,000
Fang Xie,

789
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,000
I know you're doing it for my own good.

790
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,599
But there are some decisions

791
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
on my own.

792
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,280
Please.

793
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,199
We need to think twice.

794
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,679
Don't think.

795
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,920
This is it?

796
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,440
Miss Su,

797
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,360
since you insist,

798
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,320
the third plan,

799
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,280
I support you too.

800
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,920
These are the locations

801
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,119
I picked for you.

802
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,679
Have a look

803
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,960
the compatibility between you and the horse.

804
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,719
Hello, Miss Su.

805
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,920
I am the editor of the proposal.

806
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,159
My name is Shu Shu.

807
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,480
I really like you.

808
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,599
Thank you for your love.

809
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Miss Su.

810
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,559
The inside is ready.

811
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,599
Let's go in and check the horses.

812
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,320
Our chief editor

813
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
he specially asks the horse owner

814
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,159
to allow you to pick the horse.

815
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,039
That's great.

816
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:39,800
Come on.

817
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,000
Our horse farm

818
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
pure blood horses like Arab horse.

819
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,639
This one is cute.

820
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,840
And Mongolian Quarter Horse,

821
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,400
which is the most popular horse

822
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,280
the most popular horse in America.

823
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,480
And warm-blooded horses.

824
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,199
If you want to cooperate with the camera,

825
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:06,760
we suggest

826
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,559
the proportionally balanced Orlov horse.

827
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,320
Miss Su.

828
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,960
Is there any horse you like?

829
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,719
Right now,

830
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,719
this horse

831
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,360
this is a Dutch warm-blooded horse.

832
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,360
It is also a retired racehorse.

833
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,719
But it's not a racing horse.

834
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,320
It's

835
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,599
dressage.

836
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,559
That's right.

837
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,880
Its name is Linda Hu.

838
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,559
Can we borrow the horse?

839
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,800
It's a pity

840
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,079
you can't borrow this horse.

841
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,960
It is a guest.

842
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,320
The one who was fostered at our racecourse.

843
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,559
The owner loves him very much.

844
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,800
There used to be films and TV series

845
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,599
and wanted to rent them.

846
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,760
But they all refused.

847
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,639
And it is not easy to tame.

848
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,320
And has a strong character.

849
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,400
And few people can handle it.

850
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
It seems like it likes Miss Su very much.

851
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
It seldom shows such warmth.

852
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,039
I'm not borrowing.

853
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,119
Do you know how Linda Hu

854
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:37,599
Important to

855
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,519
In our boss?

856
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,599
She's the one

857
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,119
who hid you here,

858
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,039
would you lend your girlfriend

859
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,119
your girlfriend or boyfriend?

860
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,000
So, no discussion.

861
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,559
Brother Gao Ling.

862
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,679
I don't know where it is

863
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,760
to ride one of the actors?

864
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,159
Even if a superstar comes,

865
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,639
even if it's here.

866
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,320
Let alone the

867
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,719
to act casually.

868
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
This sound sounds familiar.

869
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,760
I just...

870
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,480
I just rejected an artist

871
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,679
who wanted to borrow horses for you.

872
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,440
Will thank me?

873
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,599
Do you mean this entertainer?

874
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,280
Wow!

875
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,760
This lady

876
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,480
looks like Miss Su?

877
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,159
The height?

878
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,000
Are you complaining about

879
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,599
the company benefits are too good

880
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,599
there are too many holidays.

881
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,400
I don't have enough work to get paid.

882
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:47,920
I'll contact the horse farm right now

883
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,719
and say you agree to borrow the horse.

884
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,679
I'll make another call.

885
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,159
No need.

886
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,559
Wait for my news.

887
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,079
I didn't know it was Su Jin.

888
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,360
Miss Su.

889
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,039
Did you really tell the owner

890
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,280
you can borrow it from me?

891
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,719
Based on our friendship with him,

892
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,280
can I borrow a horse?

893
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,840
It's OK. Let's release it.

894
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,159
My boss said that

895
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,719
that when the owner is not here,

896
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,559
no one can

897
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,079
and Linda Hu secretly.

898
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,159
Miss Su,

899
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,039
I think you'd better change the horse.

900
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Little Su.

901
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,559
Since Ma works for Mr. Mu,

902
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,360
why wouldn't he agree

903
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,280
to borrow our horses?

904
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,360
Are you having

905
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
you're having a fight?

906
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,960
My trainer

907
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,039
hasn't arrived yet?

908
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,599
Xiao Xia, hurry up.

909
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,599
Yes, Mr. Mu.

910
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,519
Mr. Mu is here.

911
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,079
Mr. Mu.

912
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,079
Are you here

913
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,000
for Little Su?

914
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,639
He came to look after

915
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,079
his girlfriend?

916
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,000
Can you ride a horse?

917
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,320
Yes, of course.

918
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,280
That's not right.

919
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,440
I won't.

920
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,559
Let me teach you.

921
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,360
But I heard that

922
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,400
Is not allowed to touch its

923
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,320
to touch its owner.

924
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,559
Here's the owner.

925
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,239
Let me take you

926
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,039
to meet him first.

927
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,000
Otherwise, why would you take photos on it?

928
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,679
Its name is Linda Hu.

929
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,079
What about your temper?

930
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,239
Sometimes it's a little fierce,

931
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,480
especially with strangers.

932
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,880
After the master.

933
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,360
Hello.

934
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,360
I can't get on the horse now.

935
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:39,960
Are you ready?

936
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,000
Come on.

937
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:50,519
Come on.

938
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,480
Relax.

939
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,559
The more nervous you are, the more it wants to bully you.

940
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,920
Grab the rope with your hand.

941
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,519
I'm right behind you.

942
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,199
Yeah, relax.

943
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,760
They are so sweet.

944
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,519
I don't like either of them.

945
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,840
Being an overbearing president.

946
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,199
Does it feel

947
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,679
boring.

948
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,400
Here you are.

949
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,840
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

950
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,639
It's for it.

951
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,639
It loves apples, just like you.

952
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,920
An apple a day to keep the doctor away.

953
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,960
Dr. Su.
