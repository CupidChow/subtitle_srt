1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,319
Stop urging me.

2
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,359
I know there's an activity.

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,120
I'm downstairs

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,159
downstairs now.

5
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,159
Dear,

6
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,200
hurry up, right?

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,680
There is a huge explosion over there.

8
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,359
You are so late.

9
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,599
I thought you

10
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,439
why would you

11
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,319
to stand you up?

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,800
Sorry

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,039
I didn't expect to

14
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
I have so many messy things

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,639
messy things in my house.

16
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,479
Don't you think

17
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,080
you owe me an explanation?

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,360
What?

19
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,599
Don't play dumb.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
You mean that day?

21
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,840
I told you that day.

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
I can't make it because of something.

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Sorry.

24
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't come here today

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
not to listen to

26
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,759
to make yourself vague.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,599
What do you want to hear then?

28
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,800
The truth?

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
As long as it's true,

30
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,319
no matter how absurd,

31
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,879
I believe whatever you say.

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,439
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,199
How ridiculous.

34
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,319
Right.

35
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,639
Just tell me

36
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,439
actually, that day,

37
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:00,919
I fell into a novel

38
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,240
a novel about the entertainment circle.

39
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,240
And realistic.

40
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,879
Alright.

41
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,479
My garden is on fire.

42
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm putting out the fire.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,719
Be more sure about it.

44
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm lost.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,759
The way to meet me is too complicated.

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,879
I got lost as I walked.

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
You once told me

48
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,039
wherever you want to go,

49
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,120
even if there isn't a way,

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,199
you will find a way out.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,840
That's right.

52
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,759
But are accidents always going to happen?

53
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,719
For example, you chisel for a long time

54
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,800
and you find out

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,759
my neighbor's road.

56
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,080
It also says

57
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,479
no mining is allowed on this road.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
When I take a closer look,

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,360
protected area?

60
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,800
What does that mean?

61
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,840
Nothing.

62
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,879
Why can't you

63
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,800
tell me the truth?

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,199
I checked with Fang Jie.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
You didn't go anywhere that day.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
You didn't travel through time.

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,879
And your house isn't on fire.

68
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,599
You're not lost, either.

69
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,240
You were at home.

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
You even wore makeup.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
But you didn't come.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Mu Hurun, is it enough?

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,759
You are only Party A to me.

74
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,960
You are my boyfriend in the agreement.

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
What makes you

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
to interrogate me about these now?

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,879
And you know that

78
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,560
these are only excuses.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,759
Why do you still want to ask?

80
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,240
Alright, I'll tell you now.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,000
I have no reason to

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,599
I'm willful.

83
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,960
I just don't want to go, OK?

84
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,479
I want to get off.

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Are you and Mr. Mu...

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,199
Don't mention his name

87
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,959
that's his name.

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,319
Ms. Gu, you're pretty.

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
That's enough

90
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,639
-Go! -Go away!

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,839
Little Jin.

92
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,920
Who's your younger sister? Why are you qualified?

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,439
Little Jin.

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,199
I was wrong before.

95
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,680
From now on, we'll be in the same trade.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
We still have a long way to go.

98
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,720
We should take care of each other.

99
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,800
Grow up together. Isn't that better?

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Right?

101
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,160
How do you want to take care of each other?

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
I know.

103
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,600
You're the host today.

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I arranged dozens of interviews

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,519
dozens of interviews

106
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
for group interviews,

107
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,879
I can cover it for you.

108
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,839
You know that

109
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,439
I'm very good at group interviews.

110
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,959
I think you're working so hard.

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,279
You can take a rest.

112
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,639
Don't get the wrong idea.

113
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,279
I don't want to steal it.

114
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,399
For your media resources.

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,319
Thank you for reminding me.

116
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,600
Fang Xie,

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,000
to inform all

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
from the press conference.

119
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,800
I will arrange a time

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,439
give them half of the time

121
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,399
of the interview.

122
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,360
No matter how late it is,

123
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,639
please wait for me.

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,800
Alright.

125
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,079
What a pity.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm not used to

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
towards Plastic Sisters.

128
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,120
The clothes came undone.

129
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,800
Threads?

130
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
That Su Jin is so mean.

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Sister, don't be angry.

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,959
Wait and see.

133
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,480
That's too much!

134
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,680
You know what?

135
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Looks an honest man.

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Your personal life is such a mess.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,759
But my love for you is worthless.

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,360
I almost forgot.

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
Sister-in-law is live-streaming today.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
Today, our investors

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
mr. Muthulen

142
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
also arrived at the scene

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,040
this movie is about

144
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,480
a magical note

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
triggered by this book.

146
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Everyone knows

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,639
our heroine,

148
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,759
where is Miss Su Jin?

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
She has had

150
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,480
are really thriving in both career and relationship.

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
I'd like to know

152
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,120
have you two

153
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,160
you were in love,

154
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,199
did you write letters

155
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,040
or diary entries?

156
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Nothing.

157
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,439
Anyone still wants to ask

158
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,839
what is the secret

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,720
to keep love fresh?

160
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,800
No need to be kept fresh.

161
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,800
What does that mean?

162
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,920
It seems that the two of you

163
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
very close indeed.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,720
Right?

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,839
And never quarreled.

166
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,000
It's so enviable.

167
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,000
There's nothing to be envious of.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Because we didn't

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,839
nothing to fight over.

170
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,879
Please.

171
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,800
That's because

172
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,439
before we had a fight,

173
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,759
before we have a fight.

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,399
You are such a

175
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,000
you really keep me in suspense.

176
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,199
Mr. Mu has been

177
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,240
In the investment.

178
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,439
I'd like to know if Mr. Mu

179
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,000
your expectation for

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
after its release?

181
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,240
First of all,

182
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,279
I definitely hope that

183
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,319
this movie can be a big hit.

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,839
But for me, personally,

185
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,079
I hope that

186
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,319
to see Xiao Jin's progress and growth

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,319
through my help.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
We didn't expect to see

189
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,879
they caught us off guard.

190
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,959
What about Xiao Jin?

191
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,160
We hope all the viewers

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
can enjoy the movie.

193
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,680
Besides, Mr. Mu doesn't need to worry.

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
With me every day.

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,199
I can do it well myself.

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,639
When two young lovers

197
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,720
flirting with each other.

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
When you flirted with me.

199
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,959
Alright.

200
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,879
Thank you for accepting

201
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,480
for this short interview.

202
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,199
Next, let's welcome

203
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,800
of the film

204
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,519
to the stage.

205
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,639
Let's wish Mystery Note

206
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,480
the Mysterious Notebook is a box office hit.

207
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,360
Su Jin, I love you!

208
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,039
What are you doing?

209
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,080
Come closer.

210
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Why is he standing in the middle?

211
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,960
Sweetheart.

212
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
She was bullied again today.

213
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,200
When are you going to comfort me?

214
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,919
Miss Su.

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,159
What's going on then?

216
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,799
You've been hostile today.

217
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,000
Originally, the film

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,240
for your couple effect.

219
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,840
Because of your couple effect.

220
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,039
It's a joint interview.

221
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,519
The hosts were flexible.

222
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
I originally thought

223
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,039
your popularity is very high.

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
It seems that

225
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
a very close relationship.

226
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,200
A famous romantic complex

227
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
approached her.

228
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,240
I was thinking

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,159
should I pick it up?

230
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,759
Stop.

231
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,159
If you don't want to continue,

232
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,519
to clean up more mess.

233
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,919
I advise you to give up your idea.

234
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,320
In addition to the content

235
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,279
to be performed.

236
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,240
I don't want to

237
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
to see him recently.

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,639
I don't want to see him for now.

239
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,440
Miss Su,

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,399
mr. Mu is actually

241
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,759
out of kindness.

242
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,639
Whether it's funds

243
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,559
channels and connections,

244
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,159
Is all out.

245
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,440
What's wrong with you these days?

246
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,080
And you want to know

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
If you believe me?

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Send a tweet now!

249
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,679
I mean Su Jin,

250
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,919
from the entertainment circle.

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,759
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
OK.

253
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Miss Su, shall we go back first?

254
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,039
I'll buy you fried chicken, okay?

255
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:49,840
Come on.

256
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,279
Su Jin!

257
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,799
Let's see how arrogant you are.

258
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Mr. Mu.

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,919
Mr. Mu wants to discuss with you

260
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,000
the mining in Yiliang Mountain.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,679
I'll go to the company right away.

262
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,759
Huron is

263
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,600
our group's mines

264
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,399
our group's mine is almost at full exploitation.

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
The mining work in Yiliangshan Mine

266
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,120
be imperative

267
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,600
second Uncle.

268
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,960
My father didn't explore this mine back then

269
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,519
I am sure you know

270
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,440
I am sure you know

271
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,000
that my older brother

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
Is stubborn.

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
Walking into a thing.

274
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
You can't even get through it.

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
But it's been so many years.

276
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,480
With no result.

277
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,559
Research on new minerals takes years

278
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,879
or decades.

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Once the results come out,

280
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,679
huron.

281
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,159
Don't you think the stakes is a bit high?

282
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,240
Over ten years.

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,159
So much manpower and material resources

284
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,279
and made no noise.

285
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,399
What's more,

286
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,159
I also have

287
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,320
wrong about me.

288
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,720
About the test?

289
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,080
After the test report

290
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
when the test report comes out.

291
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,759
Huron.

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
We are doing a company,

293
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,759
not a research institute.

294
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
If you keep wasting time like this,

295
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,120
the actual situation of our company

296
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
than our company.

297
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,879
Huron.

298
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,200
Listen to Second Uncle.

299
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,519
And think about it.

300
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,440
Second Uncle.

301
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Please give me more time.

302
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,440
Mr. Mu.

303
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,799
Say it quickly. I'm not in the mood.

304
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't be fierce.

305
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,399
I have good news for you.

306
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,679
There's news

307
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,440
and Mu Hurun.

308
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
Do you want to know

309
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
what news?

310
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,399
Why did you lock the door?

311
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,440
Fang Xie,

312
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,840
you'd better give me

313
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,600
a reasonable reason

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,879
to be mad in the morning.

315
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,039
There are reporters downstairs.

316
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,440
Why?

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,159
Other than cooperation,

318
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,200
to be performed.

319
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,879
I don't want to

320
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,480
to meet him recently.

321
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,080
I thought

322
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,279
your popularity is very high.

323
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,120
It seems that

324
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
a very close relationship.

325
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,480
A famous romantic complex

326
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,200
approached her.

327
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,600
I was thinking

328
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
should I pick it up?

329
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,240
Stop.

330
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,159
Do you believe that I can now

331
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,919
I'll post a tweet.

332
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,519
Su Jin,

333
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,720
farewell to the showbiz.

334
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,320
Is this...

335
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
That day in the basement?

336
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,799
I don't know who took it

337
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,720
and cut it like this.

338
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,480
Now everyone is posting articles,

339
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,879
that you have cheated the audience.

340
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,639
Miss Su.

341
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm really sorry.

342
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,080
Can you hit me? Scold me?

343
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
I said those words with you.

344
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
And I'm the one who lost your temper.

345
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
You can't take the blame.

346
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,399
How's the situation now?

347
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,600
All the media downstairs

348
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
are waiting for you

349
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
to take your first-hand account.

350
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,200
We'll try to

351
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,000
be low-profile.

352
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,600
I've discussed with the company.

353
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,159
To cancel all the announcements.

354
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,360
Stay at home

355
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
stay at home as much as possible.

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,919
Leave the rest to me.

357
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,200
Thank you for your hard work.

358
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,799
If there's anything,

359
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,000
please tell me right away.

360
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,159
Then I...

361
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,679
You can do anything

362
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,759
as long as you don't go out.

363
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,679
I'll take care of it.

364
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
Will it be me

365
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
will it be ruined by me?

366
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,840
In addition to the cooperation,

367
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,879
to be performed.

368
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,559
I don't want to

369
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,440
allow me to see him.

370
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,799
This is clearly

371
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,159
and making rumors.

372
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,559
The purpose is to

373
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,519
to draw attention.

374
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,799
How about this?

375
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,440
Find an identification team.

376
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,799
Once we find the source,

377
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,000
request the lawyer to send a letter.

378
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,759
Such a matter cannot be tolerated.

379
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,639
Alright.

380
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,360
I'll keep in touch with Fang Fang.

381
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,840
But their voices

382
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
In the recording.

383
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll see if they

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,960
If they can provide some clues

385
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,559
to find the source.

386
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:35,799
Then go on.

387
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,440
By the way,

388
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:38,919
how about this?

389
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,399
Call Fang Jie again.

390
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,639
Tell him all the arrangements

391
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,159
all the arrangements and processes

392
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
and process.

393
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,159
And tell him

394
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,799
If he encounters any troubles,

395
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,639
and that is hard to deal with,

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,879
you can come to me.

397
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,440
OK. A hundred percent.

398
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,279
Although I don't know

399
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,960
what happened to you recently,

400
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,200
but if there's anything

401
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,159
If you need help,

402
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
you can call me anytime.

403
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,679
If it was Xiao Jin,

404
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,159
how would she handle it?

405
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,879
The life we have now

406
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,639
Is like a mask

407
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,360
a mask glued to the skin.

408
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,080
Closely

409
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,120
repeat myself with all these hypocrites.

410
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,399
And depressing memories

411
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,720
have been bonded.

412
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,759
Now in retrospect,

413
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,039
since I signed the agreement,

414
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,679
special feelings

415
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,159
have taken root

416
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,360
♪ And rooted in my heart ♪

417
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,000
Why haven't you replied?

418
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,720
Mu Hurun, is it enough?

419
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,399
You are only Party A to me.

420
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,639
You are my boyfriend in the agreement.

421
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,519
What makes you

422
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,480
to interrogate me about these now?

423
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,600
And you know that

424
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,200
these are only excuses.

425
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
Why are you asking me that?

426
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,559
Hello, Miss Mo.

427
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,480
The revision of the paper.

428
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,920
Hello?

429
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,880
Hello, Brother.

430
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,119
Are you busy

431
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,160
what's up

432
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,799
do you know where Gao Ling

433
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,680
where Gao Ling is now?

434
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:32,799
Gao Ling.

435
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,079
What's the matter?

436
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,839
It's about work.

437
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,079
We might be in

438
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,680
at the bar we often went to.

439
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,920
What was it about work?

440
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You can just ask me.

441
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,519
No, I'm fine.

442
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,960
You don't have to trouble yourself with such an inferior question.

443
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,880
I have to go now.

444
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,480
Hold on.

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,759
What?

446
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,200
What...

447
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,200
I...

448
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,920
I have a customer.

449
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,720
The client, friend.

450
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,799
Right. A friend of client's.

451
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,559
A friend of mine

452
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,359
the thing is,

453
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,079
he has

454
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,279
with his girlfriend.

455
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,359
And then

456
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,119
our relationship became awkward.

457
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,240
And asked me what to do.

458
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,079
You know

459
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,640
how can I understand this?

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
So I want to ask you

461
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,559
If you have any opinions.

462
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,920
Are there any conflicts?

463
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,640
I think so.

464
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,759
The wife has a secret she doesn't want to tell.

465
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,680
But I will

466
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,599
that client friend of mine

467
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,640
already knows.

468
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,200
He cheated on her.

469
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,160
Hey.

470
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,359
Pregnant and run with the ball?

471
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,359
What are you talking about?

472
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,640
Then what's the reason?

473
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,759
You don't talk about the problem,

474
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,920
then how can he suit the remedy?

475
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
In short,

476
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
It's hard to express the specific name.

477
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,759
Anyway, I don't know

478
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,920
the details.

479
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,559
Your friend is so dramatic.

480
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,759
Hypocritical.

481
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,799
He asked someone to chase his wife

482
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,920
when helping me with my wife.

483
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Please wait.

484
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,279
It's done.

485
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,680
I've given you the usual secret method

486
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,400
the contract.

487
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Transfer it to him.

488
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,279
I really have something to do.

489
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,200
I'll hang up now, bye bye.

490
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey. Hey.

491
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,680
Xiaoman.

492
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,160
They prefer cold war.

493
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,839
And the Cold War.

494
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,759
Mr. Gao,

495
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,400
how are you going to

496
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,599
why so late?

497
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,440
I have something to do. I got off work later.

498
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,720
Cheers!

499
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,720
That's right.

500
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,960
Great. I will catch you red-handed.

501
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,119
Mr. Gao,

502
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,039
do you remember the girl

503
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,160
the girl you talked about last time?

504
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,359
Dear.

505
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Xiaoman.

506
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,039
This is Xiaoman.

507
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,079
I'm Gao Ling's girlfriend.

508
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,000
Girlfriend?

509
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,640
No, I won't.

510
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,079
Little boy!

511
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,240
These are the interns

512
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,119
for internship.

513
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,920
Who's a kid?

514
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,759
It's you.

515
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,279
Don't make fun of her.

516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,759
This might be

517
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,359
this could be your soul mate.

518
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,519
Hey.

519
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,240
Go home and sleep.

520
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,640
Mr. Gao, are you going to order more wine or not?

521
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,960
Other tables are waiting for me.

522
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,000
Then

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
the same bottle as before.

524
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,160
Please.

525
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Give me a bottle of

526
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
your most expensive wine.

527
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
I want to be alone with my

528
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,599
with my darling.

529
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,480
No problem. You two can have a chat.

530
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,440
My dear ancestors,

531
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
brother Gao Ling.

532
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,240
I think your soul mate

533
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,359
Is to talk

534
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,599
to talk about money with you.

535
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
You are mine

536
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,920
you won't leave!

537
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,759
What are we going to do to the lady?

538
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,599
Sister, I've brought you

539
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,559
what you want.

540
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,440
Those reporters downstairs

541
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,400
downstairs

542
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,079
fang Xie didn't follow you, right?

543
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,720
She's not here.

544
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,960
But Ats...

545
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,400
Why do you need a wig?

546
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,559
Isn't this exactly the same

547
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,680
exactly the same?

548
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,720
Exactly the same.

549
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,359
Is that Su Jin?

550
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,400
Su Jin has the same hairstyle.

551
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,599
I've seen this outfit before too.

552
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,920
It must be her.

553
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,799
I also think

554
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,599
can it be?

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,039
Let's go and have a look.

556
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,839
Mr. Mu, here is some important information.

557
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,839
Mr. Mu Xiuren.

558
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,519
I didn't expect to see you here.

559
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,599
I heard that

560
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,200
about geology here

561
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,079
were donated by you.

562
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,799
Right?

563
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,720
Is it true?

564
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,519
Mr. Mu.

565
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,839
I'm afraid you might get attacked.

566
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
How have you been these days?

567
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,319
Pretty good.

568
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
Regarding the recording,

569
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,880
about the recording.

570
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,640
It was my fault.

571
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,799
It's my fault.

572
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,640
That day,

573
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,680
It's really impolite

574
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
to keep pressing you like this.

575
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,200
Sorry.

576
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,440
Say it one more time.

577
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,480
Mr. Mu, were you apologizing

578
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
sorry to me just now?

579
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,759
I didn't hear clearly just now.

580
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,680
Say that again.

581
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,000
Listen carefully.

582
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,400
Over the past few days, I...

583
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,759
I had trouble eating and sleeping.

584
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,720
To eat or sleep.

585
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,359
My ears can't work well either.

586
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,799
Sorry.

587
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,480
Now I hear it.

588
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,720
Then our cold war

589
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,319
so much.

590
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,640
What cold war?

591
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,119
Nothing.

592
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,039
By the way,

593
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,200
according to Fang's explanation,

594
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,799
because of your trick,

595
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,640
he's apologizing to the media

596
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
to the media one by one.

597
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,759
That's right. I still have something to do.

598
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,400
If you go downstairs now,

599
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
no doubt you'll be recognized.

600
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,920
Follow me.

601
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,480
This library

602
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,119
has a deep collaboration with Mu's Group.

603
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,119
No one will come to the second floor.

604
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,920
I'll send you

605
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
I'll send you an account of the internal website.

606
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,079
You can investigate whatever you want.

607
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,039
You can stay until the museum is closed.

608
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,640
This place is secluded.

609
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,680
Thank you.

610
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,720
Go back to your work.

611
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,920
Thank you.

612
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,559
It's my pleasure.

613
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,480
Paparazzi.

614
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,000
Are you doing?

615
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,720
Usually, you expose

616
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,079
speaks the truth.

617
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,000
You really have to keep an eye on someone?

618
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,720
Who got lost in the community.

619
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,640
You don't know?

620
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,480
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

621
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,400
We didn't do our job well.

622
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,559
Sorry doesn't help.

623
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,039
Hello

624
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,440
who are you?

625
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,680
And the people who are paying you,

626
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,599
a decent egg comes and goes.

627
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,680
If we can't find Su Jin and Mu Hurun,

628
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,319
what about the people around him?

629
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,000
Such a big thing happened.

630
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,160
Didn't the people around them

631
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,319
knew nothing?

632
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,680
That's right. You're right.

633
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,279
Also,

634
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,240
continue to keep an eye on Su Jin's house.

635
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,200
As long as she shows her face,

636
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,440
we must make new contributions

637
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,759
okay, don't worry this time.

638
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,400
Is there a problem

639
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,599
with the methods?

640
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,599
It seems Gaoling won't accept

641
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,119
won't accept these tricks.

642
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,599
Search the places you don't understand.

643
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,519
He will attack.

644
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,640
Tough flirting?

645
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,400
Are not reliable.

646
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,039
The story on the website is good.

647
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,880
It's so touching.

648
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,839
Just follow this.

649
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,720
Write a love letter first.

650
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,079
And then make an accident.

651
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,799
For a innocent and tragic start.

652
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,119
That's it.

653
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,400
Write a love letter.

654
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,759
How to write a love letter?

655
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,680
There's finally one thing

656
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,759
smoothly.

657
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,799
It's so late.

658
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,240
I've finished my work.

659
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
Why are you still here?

660
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,680
Make do with the special period.

661
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,519
Thank you.

662
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,480
You're welcome.

663
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,680
I'm just reminding you in a way.

664
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,079
You still owe me dinner.

665
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,480
When I finish this matter,

666
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,319
I promise you that

667
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,720
no matter what the result is,

668
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,799
I'll return

669
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,799
return the dinner.

670
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,319
It's a deal

671
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,079
hello?

672
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,720
What's so important?

673
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:28,960
What?

674
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,799
Got it.

675
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,279
What's up

676
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,839
a group of reporters

677
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,160
who doesn't know the address

678
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,480
and now she's waiting in front of my mom's house.

679
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,640
She tripped.

680
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,440
How is Aunt Hua?

681
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,599
I heard that she's fine.

682
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,400
I need to go back now.

683
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,200
Go now.

684
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,759
When you're home,

685
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,640
when you're home.

686
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,559
Call me if you need anything.

687
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,880
I'm too willful?

688
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,039
Affect people around me.

689
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,240
Why didn't you tell me

690
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,559
If you had gone to the library?

691
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,279
Because you had Xiao Xia pretend to be you.

692
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,440
Those unscrupulous marketing accounts

693
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
I don't know how many gossip articles

694
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,799
published gossip articles.

695
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,599
I don't want to blame you.

696
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,799
Of course you have something to do.

697
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,640
I found that

698
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,839
you are not yourself recently.

699
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:37,960
Be careful

700
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,920
on your way back.

701
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,640
The number of paparazzi never decreases.

702
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,319
Don't be hurt by them then.

703
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,559
Tell me if you have to.

704
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,519
I'll pick you up.

705
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,359
Miss Su,

706
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,720
we're protecting you. Don't be afraid.

707
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,559
Sister, when are you coming back?

708
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,000
Have you finished your things?

709
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,920
Don't worry about the useless things online.

710
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,240
Did you eat today?

711
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,440
I wonder how Aunt Hua is.

712
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,400
Aunt Hua, are you all right?

713
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,559
I'm sorry that you got hurt

714
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,920
because of me.

715
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,640
Aunt Hua.

716
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,279
It's Xiaojin.

717
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,839
I'm fine.

718
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,599
I sprained my foot

719
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,400
I sprained my ankle.

720
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,400
Don't blame yourself.

721
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,599
Look at Huron.

722
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,440
She shouldn't

723
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,240
how can I talk to you about such a trivial matter?

724
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,799
It's you

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,920
these days,

726
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,119
those rumors outside

727
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,759
and the

728
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,079
on the Internet,

729
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,400
It's all your fault, my son.

730
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,279
How's your relationship with Huron?

731
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,440
About you and Huron?

732
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
Right? It's fine.

733
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,960
Listen to Aunt Hua.

734
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,519
Eat well and take good care of yourself.

735
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,799
The next time you go home,

736
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,119
you can't be thinner.

737
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,200
Got it?

738
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,920
All right, aunt Hua.

739
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,599
I won't tell you anymore.

740
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,920
On Weibo the other day.

741
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,480
Half an hour.

742
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,799
See you downstairs.

743
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,200
You've been here for days.

744
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,880
Ask your questions.

745
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
And then go home.

746
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:28,839
In the past few days,

747
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,880
why didn't you explain yourself

748
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,279
why didn't you explain it?

749
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,920
As actors and actresses,

750
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,559
our works speak for ourselves.

751
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,119
As for my personal life,

752
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,000
I fully understand your curiosity.

753
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,920
But I won't follow the rules.

754
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,039
Those who make up stories

755
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,880
the vulgar taste of a sneak peek.

756
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,799
I also want you to know that

757
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,680
artists have their own privacy.

758
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,559
Harass and hurt my family and friends.

759
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,279
I will get to the bottom of it.

760
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,240
I also hope that

761
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,319
can be watched

762
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,200
learns to be responsible

763
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
for your actions.

764
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,160
Secretly filmed,

765
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,720
and malicious editing.

766
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,839
Someone who tries to speak up for me

767
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
then one day,

768
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,880
the law will speak for you, too.

769
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,160
So you mean that...

770
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,680
Those online are just rumors?

771
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
The fool follows the crowd, and the wise will distinguish themselves.

772
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,519
Any other questions?

773
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,240
If not,

774
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,880
please go back and rest.

775
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,759
Please answer me directly.

776
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,960
Is your relationship

777
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,039
was it true or not?

778
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,480
Did you really love each other?

779
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,119
Will you really marry

780
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,079
each other?

781
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,759
Really

782
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,359
really

783
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:23,839
please answer.

784
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,960
Please answer directly.

785
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,559
Mr. Mu and I are

786
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,680
certainly.

787
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,000
Mr. Mu is here.

788
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,839
Miss Su Jin and I

789
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,440
no matter what happens

790
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,440
or encounter in the future,

791
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,760
our relationship

792
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,800
will never change.

793
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,840
How can you prove that?

794
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,000
That's right. How can you prove that?

795
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,440
Trust me.

796
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,280
Since you two are so in love,

797
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,519
then the public notice

798
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,159
online exposed,

799
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,119
what is your contract

800
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,000
you mentioned?

801
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,840
Right.

802
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,119
Yes. That contract...

803
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:46,920
The contract?

804
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,000
That contract is nothing but

805
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Is about a love variety show.

806
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,360
I didn't expect that

807
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,599
there would be such a huge misunderstanding.

808
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,599
I'm really sorry.

809
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,360
Are you planning

810
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,599
do a variety show together?

811
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,519
Right.

812
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,440
We think

813
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,599
we can do it

814
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,760
meet everyone

815
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,760
to meet everyone.

816
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll follow you later.

817
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,119
I hope you can look forward

818
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,320
by then.

819
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,159
Where is the hammer?

820
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,559
They're watching.

821
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,199
Good Muhurun.

822
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,719
How dare you play this trick on me?

823
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,920
Sorry.

824
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,400
I took the initiative just now.

825
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,880
The reporters downstairs

826
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,440
won't leave for a while.

827
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:35,960
Don't thank me.

828
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,079
I know. I was

829
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,000
naturally.

830
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,320
It's too natural.

831
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,440
Why did you agree to

832
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,559
on behalf of me?

833
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
You don't have to agree.

834
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,639
But if you don't agree...

835
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,920
There will be more trouble later.

836
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,400
I'm not used to being protected.

837
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,519
What's more,

838
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,280
there's no requirement

839
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,559
mr. Mu should be worried about this.

840
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,280
I think you'll have to

841
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,719
get used to it.

842
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,159
Remember to close the door.

843
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,599
You called me to the company headquarters

844
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,119
very early in the morning,

845
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,000
what do you want?

846
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,159
Miss Su,

847
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,920
this is the best value

848
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
see? Even if we record in 12 days,

849
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,159
how about airing for two months?

850
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,519
The exposure and topicality

851
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,599
are going to be incredible.

852
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,039
It can't last 12 hours.

853
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,000
The press has released the statement.

854
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
It's bad if I don't go.

855
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,239
Mu Hurun promised.

856
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,800
Ask him to find a solution.

857
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,519
That's what you were talking about?

858
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,880
That your contract with Mr. Mu

859
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,960
needs you

860
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,119
to meet the needs of party A.

861
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,880
Right?

862
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,440
Threatening me with this.

863
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,639
I can memorize every detail of

864
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,400
the new cooperation.

865
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Chapter 8, Article 17

866
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,800
Any event

867
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,679
attend any event,

868
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,440
a joint appearance

869
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
requires approval of both parties.

870
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,079
Neither party

871
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,000
to make a decision

872
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,280
he is arranging a twelve-day date

873
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,880
for me without permission.

874
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
To sue him without any lawyer,

875
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,079
to sue him.

876
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,599
However,

877
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,960
fang Jie, whose side are you on?

878
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,440
This is not your turn.

879
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,679
You have to do this.

880
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,599
Either you or...

881
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,239
Either you hammer it with a hammer

882
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,159
hammer me to death.

883
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
That's good. Fang Xie.

884
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,519
You forced my sister

885
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,440
force my sister back then, right?

886
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,760
It seems that I should judge

887
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,119
why my sister left.

888
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,960
She left?

889
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
Sister, where are you going?

890
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,679
I'm not going anywhere.

891
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,800
Sis,

892
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,239
I know you work hard in acting.

893
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,119
You don't have enough to eat or warm clothes.

894
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,599
You need to wear suspenders in winter,

895
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,880
In the summer, you should wear coats.

896
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,000
This reality show

897
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,039
I'll tell him on your behalf.

898
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,199
We won't go.

899
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,440
Brother Fang,

900
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,199
stop forcing Miss Su.

901
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,159
Xiao Xia, you heard wrong.

902
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,079
I don't want to leave.

903
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,880
I heard it wrong.

904
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
That might be because

905
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,039
I have been too tense recently

906
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,800
and always worried about something.

907
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,719
That's good.

908
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,079
Have some coffee to warm your hands.

909
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,800
Thank you.

910
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,440
I'll leave you two alone.

911
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,960
I'll go organize the report.

912
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,199
Just go.

913
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,559
The thing between me and my sister

914
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,639
to Xia all the time.

915
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,519
To hide the truth.

916
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,679
You find the right time

917
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,559
to tell her, right?

918
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,320
Miss Su, I know that

919
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,960
you've greatly helped me

920
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,480
to stay back this time.

921
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,719
During this period,

922
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
I have been forcing you to do

923
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,119
things that you don't like.

924
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,880
Actually, I feel guilty too.

925
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:34,920
Forget about it.

926
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,119
Fine, then.

927
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,719
I'll handle the rest.

928
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Thank you, Fang Xie.

929
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,320
Breakfast for me.

930
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,360
You put so much effort into it.

931
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,079
All the reporters downstairs have left.

932
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,519
After the breakfast,

933
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,119
please clean the dishes.

934
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,920
And leave my house.

935
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,159
This breakfast

936
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,480
to thank you for helping me out.

937
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,960
Don't even think about love.

938
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,519
I won't participate in our cooperation

939
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,719
I won't participate in it.

940
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,639
Hey.

941
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,960
Hello, Mr. Mu.

942
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,159
To edit and record.

943
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,400
Of the editing and recording.

944
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:02,519
And I've handed it

945
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,480
to the relevant departments.

946
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,039
As you expected,

947
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,519
he admitted.

948
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,719
Was ordered by your second uncle.

949
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,280
So,

950
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,119
we need to inform them,

951
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,119
they need to be taken care of.

952
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,440
I can't.

953
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,400
Didn't she promise to

954
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,440
In front of the camera yesterday?

955
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,639
With such a popular show,

956
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,000
other artists are hoping to

957
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,639
be the next flying guest.

958
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,280
Su Jin thinks that

959
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,280
that she can be self-willed

960
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,920
and be willful now?

961
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,800
President Chen.

962
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,199
Su Jin has been under great pressure recently.

963
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,000
She has too many appointments.

964
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,199
You need to be clear.

965
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
That you live on commission.

966
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,599
You have your own performance.

967
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,119
If you don't want to be the manager,

968
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,639
there are so many who want to be it.

969
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:49,719
That's right.

970
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,920
You are right.

971
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:51,760
I'll think of another way

972
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,719
I'll think of other ways.

973
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,159
I won't hold the company back.

974
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,480
But this love affair

975
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,320
I can't.

976
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,639
Why did you come back?

977
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,199
You left the car key there.

978
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,760
Are you all right?

979
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,559
What can it be?

980
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,039
Don't forget that

981
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,079
I am the manager who made

982
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,239
of the national flower Su Jin.

983
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,000
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

984
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,760
Fang Xie,

985
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,760
maybe we should go together.

986
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,440
That was a joke.

987
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,119
Nothing. Tell me.

988
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,679
You can go to

989
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,159
really?

990
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,199
This is strange.

991
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:33,920
Since you're so kind to invite Prince Yu,

992
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,800
would I dare not go?

993
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,719
Okay. See you later.

994
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:37,599
See you later.

995
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,119
Xiaoman.

996
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,719
Who are you talking to?

997
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,519
Having a date?

998
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,320
Or an insider?

999
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,079
If you're too ambitious,

1000
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,719
that's good.

1001
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,679
Now you know

1002
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,679
I'm dating someone.

1003
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
Then stop thinking about it.

1004
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,880
Gao Ling, wait here.

1005
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:49,440
What are you doing?

1006
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,679
Having a date.

1007
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:51,960
What?

1008
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,760
Aren't you going to see

1009
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,079
your date?

1010
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,599
I'd like to see that.

1011
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,679
That can make you refuse?

1012
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,880
That my girlfriend

1013
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,159
which stage?
