1
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,480
Did I drive too fast?

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,079
Why is it here again?

3
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,719
I'm off.

4
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,159
Let me hug you for a while.

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,719
It's only an hour.

6
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,120
Our home is so close.

7
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,719
I didn't notice this before.

8
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
Mu, have you had enough fun?

9
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Can I still go home today?

10
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,680
I can't bear to let you go.

11
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
It's already 10 p.m.

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
You have to work tomorrow?

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
I have to work.

14
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
What if we are both late?

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,199
What to do?

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright.

17
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,879
That's enough. Stop here.

18
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,560
- Stop. - Good night.

19
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,719
Let me see you off.

20
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,680
Please.

21
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,800
Come on.

22
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,639
Mr. Mu.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Having you as my boyfriend

24
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,479
Is my greatest blessing.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
Love you.

26
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,599
It's over so soon?

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,080
Watch it again.

28
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,520
Mr. Mu.

29
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,520
Having you as my boyfriend

30
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,400
alright.

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,159
Let me show you.

32
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't pull a long face.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
Director Mu.

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,599
Please stop.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,319
If I remember correctly,

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,039
we've watched it 23 times.

37
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,039
That many times? No.

38
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,039
Then tell me

39
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,960
how is the feeling

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
mr. Mu, here is the thing.

41
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,280
That you and Miss Su

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,919
you and Miss Su are together.

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,599
I won't say anything rash.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,400
That's all.

45
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,719
How about I write you another letter

46
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,000
of 1,000 words?

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,280
That's not the case.

48
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
800 is enough.

49
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,840
Goodbye, Mr. Mu.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Come back.

51
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,120
Here's the thing.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,360
I

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
I prepared her a gift.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,479
I want to give her this.

55
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,479
You know

56
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,560
this is the first time

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,199
that I've given her a gift in a formal way.

58
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,759
That's why

59
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,879
I want to talk to you

60
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,599
the proposal.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,520
Don't we need hands to give gifts?

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
What's the solution?

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't mind that.

64
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,479
I found some

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,240
some online

66
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,279
let's have a look.

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,639
What about

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
I think

69
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,800
this proposal

70
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,360
Is not great.

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,759
What do you know?

72
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,079
Right.

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
If you really understand,

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
you wouldn't have always had girlfriends.

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,399
This is gorgeous.

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,199
You prepared all of these?

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,199
Certainly.

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Mu Huron.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Muhuron.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,480
She comes out so soon?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,879
Didn't you say there were 10 minutes?

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,319
No, I was afraid that you'd wait for me outside.

83
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,879
So I came out early.

84
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,639
I suddenly remembered that

85
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,959
I happened to have

86
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
to have a conference call.

87
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,800
Ten minutes more.

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,199
Why don't you go up and stay a little longer?

89
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,680
It won't take long.

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,240
Hey,

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
look at the back.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
What's the situation?

93
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,920
What do you mean?

94
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,879
The back.

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,399
Did you create this?

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,079
Oh, that.

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,079
How could it be me?

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,319
I have no idea who did it.

99
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,480
Maybe someone wanted to

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,600
to prepare a surprise for someone?

101
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Who knows.

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,279
Quickly go up.

103
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,160
Is it a surprise

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,519
you prepared for me?

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, that's right.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Ready!

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,439
Ready?

108
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:35,839
This...

109
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
How is that possible?

110
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,600
Are you sure about...

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Are you sure it's not him?

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,240
Really?

113
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
That's good. I told you so.

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
This is old-fashioned.

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,839
It fits your

116
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,959
It doesn't fit your taste at all.

117
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,360
It's too exaggerated.

118
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,879
It's not a surprise

119
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,720
Is not a surprise.

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,879
This is a scare.

121
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,720
Out of fashion.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
Look at those colors.

123
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,600
Pink and floral.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
What's this?

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes

126
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,800
what year is it now?

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,560
They still engage in this pink stuff.

128
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,319
She is not a teenager.

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,839
But who prepared these?

130
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,199
Downstairs downstairs.

131
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,399
It wasn't me.

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,319
As the chairman of Mu's Group,

133
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,120
the fiancé of Su Jin.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,560
How could he

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
do such a thing?

136
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,600
Mr. Mu.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,879
The setting is ready.

138
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,800
Please have a look.

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,360
Are you tired?

140
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,560
A little.

141
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.

142
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,120
Hold on.

143
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,439
I know that

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,199
this is your first time in a relationship.

145
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,199
Inevitably,

146
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,319
too much.

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,560
However, gift giving

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,040
emphasizes thought and timing.

149
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,560
The form doesn't have to be complicated.

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Get to the point.

151
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,839
For example?

152
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,160
You can ask her

153
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,399
to close her eyes

154
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,279
and quietly,

155
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,079
take out the necklace you gave her

156
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,759
put it on her secretly.

157
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,879
Her sincerity for the gift

158
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,639
her sincerity.

159
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,839
That's simple and direct,

160
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,360
win support among the people

161
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,199
great.

162
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,279
That's it for tonight.

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,279
Boss, what are you up to?

164
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,639
Shouldn't he be having a date

165
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,919
hello?

166
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,480
Huron, I'm going on a business trip.

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,159
Business trip?

168
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,080
How long will it be?

169
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,360
He said he would shoot a commercial

170
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,159
It will take about a week.

171
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,559
That long?

172
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
I will miss you.

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,639
All right, Fang Jie and others are here.

174
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,960
I have to go now.

175
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,559
See you later.

176
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,519
Hey. Hey.

177
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,559
What about my schedule?

178
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,320
The following schedule

179
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Is pretty full.

180
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,960
We have to have meetings

181
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,159
we'll have a meeting.

182
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,480
The following days?

183
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,399
I have a business trip in the morning and I'll be back overnight.

184
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,519
The following days?

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,360
We'll develop the new project

186
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,519
with the R & D team.

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
The following days?

188
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang

189
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
their schedules are packed.

190
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Are you tired, Little Su?

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,840
Have some water.

192
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,399
Hey.

193
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,360
Finally, you're resting.

194
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
I just finished work and I'm going back to the hotel.

195
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,879
Are you tired?

196
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,440
Tired?

197
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,639
I've been photographing for a whole day. My legs feel numb.

198
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,039
My face froze with laughter.

199
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,039
When you say that,

200
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,480
I can hardly believe it.

201
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,679
I once asked you if you were tired,

202
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,720
you always told me

203
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,960
you don't feel tired or hurt.

204
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,919
What?

205
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,720
You don't want to play tough now?

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,159
You were Party A.

207
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,159
But now,

208
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,360
you're my boyfriend.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,639
Your boyfriend?

210
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,759
That sounds

211
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,720
to sound so comfortable.

212
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm leaving tomorrow.

213
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,000
Mr. Mu, did you miss me?

214
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,399
I miss you very much

215
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,440
what about you?

216
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
Miss me?

217
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes, Mr. Mu.

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,399
Mr. Mu.

219
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
Aren't you very busy?

220
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
Why are you here?

221
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
I miss my girlfriend so much

222
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,279
so I finished all the work

223
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,480
all the work ahead of time

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,399
I can take her home.

225
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,039
What about

226
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,320
you should have

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,919
shouldn't I be rewarded

228
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,960
be rewarded?

229
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,000
That's all?

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
It seems Doctor Su

231
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
was a little perfunctory.

232
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,679
Mr. Mu, you are really arrogant right now.

233
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,799
What do you want to do?

234
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,279
I want to

235
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,320
want my girlfriend

236
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,559
you don't have any private time

237
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,440
Is there a problem?

238
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,159
I promise you.

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,799
Come on.

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,039
Xia, see you.

241
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,679
See you later.

242
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,039
So much for celestial love.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,519
I've been busy shooting these days.

244
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,120
I didn't even get the chance to hang out.

245
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,639
Mr. Mu, I want to use my cell phone to light up.

246
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,720
He looks really good.

247
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,279
Mr. Mu.

248
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,279
Give me a name.

249
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,480
A name?

250
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,000
To see its quality,

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,279
we'll call it

252
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,639
the Golden Stone.

253
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,600
It really fits

254
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,840
the temperament of a mine owner.

255
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,919
What's your name then?

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
I think it's

257
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,639
It's called the quicksand river.

258
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,840
Look at it.

259
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,080
Weathered through,

260
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,679
from the big river to here.

261
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,399
And finally it fell into my hands.

262
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,399
Sense of story.

263
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,559
This is over-packaged.

264
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,159
This is for you.

265
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,639
Thank you, Doctor Su.

266
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Why did you pick them up?

267
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,039
I want to pick up more for you.

268
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,559
Xiao Xia, Fang Xie Shan,

269
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,799
hey.

270
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,279
The stone

271
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,320
to throw away a stone?

272
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,550
That's not random.

273
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,270
They were all meticulously selected.

274
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
There are also Xiaoman and Kaoling.

275
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,270
We've got them all.

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
Are you handing out leaflets?

277
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,150
What are you doing?

278
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Don't pick it up.

279
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,630
It's getting late.

280
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,750
You're right. The light is not good at night.

281
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
Come back tomorrow during the day.

282
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,750
Not in daytime, either.

283
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
We went back in daytime.

284
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
We don't have time.

285
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,510
That's right.

286
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,550
Since you gave me a gift,

287
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,440
I'll just return

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
return the favor casually.

289
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
What?

290
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,030
Close your eyes first.

291
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,750
Turn around.

292
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,960
What?

293
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,240
Right away.

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
Don't be anxious.

295
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,550
Mu Huron.

296
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,360
Are you alright?

297
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,200
Are you hurt?

298
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
My wrist hurts so much.

299
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,720
I really don't understand.

300
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,870
The invisible warning sign?

301
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,870
A warning sign?

302
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
What could it warn you of?

303
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,480
You're convinced now.

304
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,600
Your glasses are broken.

305
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,080
Look at the mud on your clothes

306
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,750
and soaked to the skin.

307
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,510
Take a shower first.

308
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,550
Or you will catch a cold.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I'll drain the water for you.

310
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,000
You can do it yourself.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,910
I need your help.

312
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't stand there.

313
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
Be careful.

314
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I think

315
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,510
I can do it myself.

316
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,150
You can do it by yourself?

317
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,910
Don't have any more problems.

318
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,910
Alright, I'll help you.

319
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,870
It's so nice to have a girlfriend to care about me.

320
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,670
Only you can do it.

321
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,320
Alright.

322
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,030
Go there first.

323
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,600
It's not a big deal.

324
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,600
Just pretend that you're some dumb.

325
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,150
Are you sure you want to wear the blindfold?

326
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,030
I'll get out if you keep this up.

327
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,870
Wash it yourself.

328
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,440
Alright.

329
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,870
Sleepy.

330
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,440
A little.

331
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,080
I've got a gift for you.

332
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,720
What?

333
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
Close your eyes first.

334
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,790
This is made by Su Jishi.

335
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,070
The black thing on top is ebony.

336
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,070
Mr. Mu,

337
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,920
that's very thoughtful of you.

338
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,920
You deserve to be Dr. Su,

339
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,200
you really learn quickly.

340
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,640
I wanted to give you this long ago.

341
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,750
But I didn't expect that

342
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,880
I didn't expect that

343
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,720
to make it.

344
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,310
Compared with you,

345
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,350
what I sent you

346
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,110
Is so perfunctory.

347
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,880
I don't want anything

348
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,790
It's the best for me.

349
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,590
Put this on for me.

350
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,440
Alright.

351
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,790
Come on.

352
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,000
Alright.

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Thank you.

354
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,790
I'll cherish it.

355
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,440
What I should do

356
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
to win his approval?

357
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,640
You're still here this late?

358
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,000
You are writing a novel again.

359
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,200
I was waiting for you after work.

360
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,830
Don't get the wrong idea.

361
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,590
I heard there is a new western restaurant

362
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,960
downstairs at your place.

363
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Has a good reputation.

364
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,270
So he wants a ride there.

365
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,240
That's it?

366
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,310
Do you think

367
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,830
I have other ideas?

368
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,030
Alright.

369
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,590
I'll send you there.

370
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,790
What do you think? Does it taste good?

371
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,270
It's getting late.

372
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,200
I will send you home.

373
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
Eat and leave?

374
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,110
You're so boring.

375
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,270
Can't you chat with me?

376
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,680
What do you want to talk about?

377
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,400
Why not?

378
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,110
Why don't you like me?

379
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,270
Or you can answer me.

380
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,110
What type of girl do you like?

381
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,070
That's a boring question.

382
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,830
Pass.

383
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,160
When was the last time

384
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,510
you had feelings for a girl?

385
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,920
Enough.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,480
This isn't

387
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,550
truth or Dare.

388
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,350
Let me send you home.

389
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,790
OK.

390
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,680
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,510
It's alright.

392
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,160
Nothing.

393
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,750
Sorry.

394
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,720
Mind your business.

395
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,350
I'm really sorry.

396
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,480
I'll get you a tissue.

397
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,110
Go to my place to change.

398
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,000
Or you'll catch a cold.

399
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,160
Let's go. Why are you standing there?

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,750
Go and change.

401
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,440
It's dry. No need to change.

402
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,790
What's up

403
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
wait for me. It won't take long.

404
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,030
What are you doing with this?

405
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,590
You've burned yourself.

406
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,920
Don't touch her.

407
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,790
Apply the medicine.

408
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,960
Don't touch it.

409
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,070
It seems that

410
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,640
he does care about me.

411
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,480
Come here.

412
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,270
Brother Gao Ling.

413
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,240
Do you like me more recently?

414
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,310
Never mind. You don't have to answer.

415
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,400
Use it.

416
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,160
Do it yourself.

417
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,830
Suddenly I have some work to do.

418
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,000
Let me know after you finish it.

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,920
I'll send you home.

420
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,070
But I... I can't see it.

421
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,960
How should I apply it?

422
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,920
The toilet is over there.

423
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,920
There is a mirror.

424
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,720
I'll do it myself.

425
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,240
It's done.

426
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,030
Look at that.

427
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
Go back and apply it.

428
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
If you have any problems,

429
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,350
go to the hospital.

430
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
I'll send you back.

431
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,270
No hurry.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,550
Aren't you still busy with your work?

433
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,030
Get back to your work. I can wait.

434
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,310
Get back to work.

435
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,240
Gao Ling, you're so tacky.

436
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
You have a photo album?

437
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,480
This is a photo album

438
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,000
talent of that era

439
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,160
Is a college graduate

440
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
when I graduated from college.

441
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,590
Is quite tender indeed.

442
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,310
Young and fresh.

443
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,590
Am I not tender now?

444
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,790
Right now,

445
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm a little ruined by my brother.

446
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,160
But it's alright.

447
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,920
This photo...

448
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,550
Why does he look so familiar?

449
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,440
What's up

450
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,270
nothing.

451
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,830
I kind of want to go back.

452
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,440
Wait for me.

453
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,310
I'll put a coat on and send you back.

454
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,920
Xiaoman.

455
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,440
Hello?

456
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
You didn't pick up my calls.

457
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,200
I almost thought something happened to you.

458
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,550
Mu Xiaoman,

459
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,160
what's wrong with you today?

460
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,310
I'm fine, just a little tired.

461
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm going to bed. Good night.

462
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,070
It's you.

463
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,790
It's really you.

464
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
Hello, blogger.

465
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,830
I really like your posts.

466
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,200
Would you mind

467
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,920
may I ask you out for a meeting?

468
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm your reader,

469
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,270
at the same time,

470
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,310
I'm also a friend of Gao Ling.

471
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,720
I hope you won't think

472
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,790
that I'm bold.

473
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,750
Sorry.

474
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,640
It might be inconvenient to meet up.

475
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,240
I don't mean anything else.

476
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm just trying to...

477
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,720
Why should I

478
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,440
please keep it to Gao Ling for me.

479
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,480
Thanks.

480
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,640
What are you looking at?

481
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,510
I wanted to confirm

482
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,030
If you have chest muscles.

483
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
I didn't expect you

484
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,550
before I touch you.

485
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,830
Unfortunately,

486
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,400
don't you know

487
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,510
you don't know yet?

488
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,750
You helped me take a shower.

489
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
What?

490
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,400
When I wake up the next day,

491
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,920
I forgot what happened last night.

492
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,160
What happened last night?

493
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,110
It seems Doctor Su

494
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,440
Is really turning around and denying all.

495
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
What can you do

496
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,920
so what?

497
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,350
Breakfast.

498
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,720
No, thanks.

499
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,310
Thanks.

500
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,350
What's the matter?

501
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Last night, why did you suddenly

502
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,920
hello?

503
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,400
You're back.

504
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,160
Got it.

505
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,960
Got it.

506
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,350
She bumped into a rich couple by the seaside.

507
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,510
He said Su Jin dressed casually

508
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,590
her pregnancy caused a heated discussion.

509
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,880
Little Su.

510
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,590
If you're really having a baby,

511
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,750
you can tell me.

512
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm not that

513
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,590
unreasonable person.

514
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,000
Fang Xie, you really

515
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,480
you think I'm

516
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,830
Irresponsible

517
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,920
and had no plan.

518
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,830
Who doesn't know how to weigh the pros and cons?

519
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,510
Of course not.

520
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,030
But sometimes,

521
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,240
young men and women

522
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,640
would lose their sanity

523
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
when they're in love.

524
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,310
Not really.

525
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,160
I won't let

526
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,480
to happen.

527
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,000
Really

528
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,920
I know.

529
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,960
That's not true.

530
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,160
I'll arrange the company

531
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
a clear statement immediately.

532
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,720
Well, Little Su

533
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,960
when will you get married?

534
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
We should be married soon.

535
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,310
In my previous life,

536
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,750
I should have saved the universe

537
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,350
because he saved the universe.

538
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,550
And my wife

539
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,270
Is about to have a good result.

540
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,750
Tell me the truth.

541
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,000
Eat less sugar when you're free.

542
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Alright?

543
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,920
I thought you young girls

544
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,480
all you want

545
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,720
saying "anti-sugar" every day.

546
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,599
It doesn't matter.

547
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,799
As long as my husband and I are happy,

548
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,799
I can be drunk with honey

549
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,039
In a jar of honey.

550
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,880
Enough.

551
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,359
Stop this nonsense.

552
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,880
How is your work?

553
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,279
Go back to work.

554
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,799
Xiaojin has accepted a clothing endorsement.

555
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
To hold a fashion show in the country this year.

556
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
You'll walk the runway at that time.

557
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,640
Oh, right,

558
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,079
you can walk on runway shows, right?

559
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,559
Walk on your feet.

560
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,759
Relax your shoulders.

561
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,480
Right.

562
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,400
Stretch your legs. Straighten your abdomen.

563
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,480
Raise your hips. Right.

564
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,359
Drive your thighs and knees. Lift your knees.

565
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,240
Use the lower leg to drive your feet.

566
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,440
That's right.

567
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,759
Good. Let's go.

568
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,519
Good. Go on.

569
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,480
Right.

570
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
That's good.

571
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,119
Okay, keep your balance.

572
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,359
Be careful.

573
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,759
Fang Jie, let me tell you something.

574
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,160
I barely

575
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
to learn to wear high heels.

576
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,519
Just let me walk the runway?

577
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,119
I want to light up

578
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,599
all my skills, right?

579
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,640
As an artist,

580
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,039
I need to learn a lot of skills.

581
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,720
A couple of days ago,

582
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,799
you were invited to host a party.

583
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,720
But I turned him down.

584
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,359
Otherwise,

585
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,640
you have to get a certificate of host.

586
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,440
Look at this.

587
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,759
Right now,

588
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,599
am I a cat?

589
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,079
Tell me the truth.

590
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,240
Really?

591
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,920
They do.

592
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,039
Even a leopard.

593
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,920
Is not bad.

594
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,720
And aggressive.

595
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,519
It suits me.

596
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,559
Little Su is really

597
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,960
you are becoming more and more powerful.

598
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,720
Alright, Miss Su.

599
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,039
That's it for today

600
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,400
for today.

601
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,519
You did a great job today.

602
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,200
But next,

603
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,640
practice more.

604
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,640
OK, thank you.

605
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
Thank you for your hard work today.

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Alright, bye.

607
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,039
Thank you, Miss Mo.

608
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,839
Alright.

609
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,799
My leg is numb.

610
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,119
Why are you here?

611
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,000
When did you come?

612
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,279
I've already come here.

613
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,880
I've been watching you for ages.

614
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,400
You're so serious with your training.

615
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,799
And I didn't want to bother you.

616
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,359
I have a little gift for you.

617
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,359
What?

618
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,119
Hold on.

619
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,200
I'll return your favor, too.

620
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,720
Alright.

621
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,799
All right.

622
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,480
Let's buy some coffee.

623
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,160
Hurry up.

624
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,759
Hurry and buy some coffee.

625
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,159
Who are you?

626
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,239
Sorry

627
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,159
I'm in the wrong place.

628
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,440
Fans these days

629
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,960
has great magic power

630
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,880
he has to come here.

631
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,480
Is it sour here?

632
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,599
A little bit.

633
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,000
Push hard.

634
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,159
Alright.

635
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,599
Brother Fang.

636
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,559
I met a really strange person

637
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,039
what a strange person.

638
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,000
What do you mean?

639
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,400
That guy was wearing a peaked cap

640
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,760
and acting stealthily.

641
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,599
She also has

642
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,960
Is also in the wallet.

643
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,119
Did that person

644
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,920
was having

645
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,199
your speculation about Little Su?

646
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Is probably a fan.

647
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,159
How old are you?

648
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,000
A man or a woman?

649
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
A man?

650
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,719
About 50 years old.

651
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,639
Don't worry. He's just a fan.

652
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,280
What's your schedule

653
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,119
next?

654
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,519
Tomorrow,

655
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,559
to shoot a commercial.

656
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,599
Don't worry.

657
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,719
I'll pay attention to the shooting site.

658
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,079
Alright, cut.

659
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,800
Thank you very much.

660
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Tough, tough.

661
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,400
That's hard.

662
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,719
My neck is broken.

663
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,119
Miss Su can take a break now.

664
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
Director, thank you.

665
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,800
Thank you, director.

666
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,760
Sit down and rest.

667
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,639
Let's fix her makeup.

668
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,199
Hurry up.

669
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,079
It's okay. We'll do it later.

670
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,119
Go and take a rest.

671
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Little Su.

672
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,880
Mr. Mu is here to video chat again.

673
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,920
Does your foot still hurt?

674
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,039
I don't anymore.

675
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,840
I've been shooting advertisement in the past two days.

676
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,960
What about you? What are you up to?

677
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I just had a meeting.

678
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,719
You finally got the time

679
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,719
to talk to you.

680
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,960
Mr. Mu is busy every day.

681
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,920
But Dr. Su is no busier than him.

682
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:24,880
What's up

683
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,639
why are you looking so serious?

684
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,840
Are Xiao Xia and Fang Xie with you?

685
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,320
That's right, look.

686
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
Xiao Xia is behind us

687
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,719
that Xia

688
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,280
hello, Mr. Mu.

689
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,360
Fang Xie,

690
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:37,920
hello, Mr. Mu.

691
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,800
Send me the address.

692
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,320
I'll pick you up at the scene later.

693
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,960
And you're afraid the fans will follow me.

694
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,480
It's better to

695
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,800
to be careful, okay?

696
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Got it. See you later.

697
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,039
As expected,

698
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,840
a real couple fears nothing.

699
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,039
This show of love

700
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,760
that's awful.

701
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,599
Two real couples?

702
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
I mean to see the scene.

703
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,079
In the future.

704
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,639
Any strange people?

705
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,840
I went to see

706
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,039
who are the fake couple?

707
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,400
To help you move.

708
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,519
Now,

709
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,840
why do you always move every day?

710
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,320
Alright, I know.

711
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Xiaoman is still here at this hour?

712
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,480
Xiaoman.

713
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,400
What are you looking at?

714
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,320
And acting nervously.

715
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm writing my own novel.

716
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,199
I don't want you to see it.

717
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,880
Don't stay so late to finish your homework.

718
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,920
Go home.

719
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:06,800
Also,

720
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,559
I don't think your complexion looks quite right

721
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,519
your complexion doesn't look right these days.

722
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,639
What's wrong?

723
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,199
I went to bed a little late

724
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,519
and got dark circles under my eyes.

725
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,920
I'll send you back then.

726
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,519
No need.

727
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,599
I can go home by myself.

728
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,079
Okay. See you on Wednesday then.

729
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,280
I'll send you the address

730
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
when I arrive.

731
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,239
See you later.

732
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,760
See you tomorrow.

733
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,840
What's wrong with her?

734
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
Recently.

735
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,119
He said you brought so many things here,

736
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,880
are you really not going to move?

737
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,079
That's not necessarily the case.

738
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
You might just

739
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,840
one day.

740
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,440
When you have the decision,

741
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,199
move to my place?

742
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,199
I'll move right away.

743
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,199
I'll move it with you.

744
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,360
It suddenly occurred to me

745
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,719
I'm going to the property management to pay the electricity bill.

746
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,559
You go up first.

747
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,559
How dare you follow me?

748
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,119
What a freak!

749
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,559
Stop beating him!

750
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,000
Don't move.

751
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:26,599
Stop it!

752
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,719
Stop beating him. I'm your father.

753
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,719
Uncle. Uncle.

754
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,199
Young people like you

755
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,639
It's...

756
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,039
He was so fierce.

757
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,159
That almost killed me.

758
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,480
I am really sorry, uncle.

759
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Please, please.

760
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
The wound will be healed if you keep yelling.

761
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,159
Yet you're leaning out.

762
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,239
He tends to be violent.

763
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,199
I don't agree.

764
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,239
The two of you are dating?

765
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,000
Anyone who is violent is me.

766
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,079
He just misunderstood.

767
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,280
For this matter,

768
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,280
for the whole thing.

769
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,480
I'm really sorry, Uncle.

770
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,599
You shouldn't say sorry to me

771
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,599
I don't think you are sincere at all.

772
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,960
And you are not good to my daughter.

773
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,440
So you mean that

774
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,079
compensation?

775
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,000
There is no use saying anything

776
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
other than the compensation.

777
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,880
Right. I should compensate you.

778
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,519
That's what I should do.

779
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,880
Here you go.

780
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,440
Huron, go home first.

781
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,800
Don't give her money.

782
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,440
Uncle,

783
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,159
If you still

784
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,079
there's anything else,

785
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,920
you can ask Xiao Jin to find me anytime.

786
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,159
You can leave now.

787
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,320
Keep the card.

788
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,480
I'll send you back.

789
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,519
My head hurts.

790
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,239
I need to go to the hospital.

791
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
I don't know how much it'll cost.

792
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,239
You're really bad at acting!

793
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,039
You're really

794
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,239
In the past.

795
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,639
She left all her money.

796
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,519
Why didn't you take it?

797
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,639
Are you trying to

798
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,920
are you really going to

799
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,280
live a good life with him?

800
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:04,840
You know what?

801
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,199
He's not a good man.

802
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,320
What on earth are you doing here?

803
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,639
Why did you suddenly return home?

804
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,000
Why would you go back to Bincheng?

805
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,199
What... what can I do?

806
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,400
I want to see what you do.

807
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,159
What's wrong with you?

808
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,400
If you don't want to study,

809
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,159
you come here to pretend to be Xiaojin.

810
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,320
What are you looking at?

811
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,920
I am your father.

812
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,320
No matter what you two become,

813
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,360
become what you become,

814
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,559
not me?
