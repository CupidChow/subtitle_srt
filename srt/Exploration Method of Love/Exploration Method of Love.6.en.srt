1
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,359
Xiaoman,

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,680
look at your brother's

3
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,799
from head to toe.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Don't look down on me.

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,719
Since Brother said that,

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,959
let's compete.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,359
Let's compete.

8
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,159
Let's compete.

9
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,359
Kaolin's archery

10
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,760
very good archery.

11
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,560
Mr. Mu,

12
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,159
are you afraid to lose?

13
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,000
Where are you going, brother?

14
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,240
Get the bow.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,159
Sister-in-law, what did you and my brother talk about?

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,479
Xiaoman will...

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,719
She's fine.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
Xiaoman doesn't want to hide anything.

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
It's all written on your face whether you're happy or not.

20
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,919
Just like you're acting.

21
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,879
I don't feel that.

22
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,199
I can't act it no matter what.

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,360
Are you saying that my acting is bad?

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,599
Sorry

25
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm not the kind of person who

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,199
because he feels sorry.

27
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,159
However,

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,240
since you have made peace with her,

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,759
I'm not a stingy person.

30
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,960
For instigating Xiaoman.

31
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,159
I mean, sorry. Make way.

32
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,800
I need to get the bow.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,719
Show him something.

34
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,120
Cherish it.

35
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,759
This is the last contest.

36
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,520
Yeah! Cool!

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,879
Good luck, Secretary Gao!

38
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,759
You are the best.

39
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,280
Good luck.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,919
OK.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,439
Screwed.

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
It's okay, Secretary Gao. Don't lose hope.

43
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,719
Isn't this the last?

44
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,360
Let me tell you, there may be a chance.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,080
He might have missed

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,960
the target might have missed.

47
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,840
Yeah! Right!

48
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,080
A martial arts master

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,719
even had some faults.

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,280
What a pity!

51
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,360
Master Mu,

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm not greedy.

53
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,560
10 days off.

54
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,360
Three days.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,919
Seven days.

56
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,639
Five days.

57
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,520
Done.

58
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,919
I thought

59
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,680
I would never

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,479
to defeat you

61
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,719
to know what it's like to beat you.

62
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,879
I have to say,

63
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,879
It feels so good.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,520
Something is wrong.

65
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,759
Thank you, ma'am.

66
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,439
Don't thank me.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
It's not you. There's no way I can beat him.

68
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,160
How about this? My treat.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Hold on.

70
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,920
One more match!

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,439
Yeah!

72
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,279
I got it.

73
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,279
Yeah!

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,759
You're really

75
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,759
you don't know how to play tennis at all.

76
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,120
How dare you to play tennis?

77
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
Who said I'm not good at all?

78
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,519
I have a wealth of theoretical knowledge.

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,360
And I watched a lot of matches too.

80
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
You wanted to drag me into the game.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,839
Going back on your word?

82
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,560
I never regret.

83
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,120
Xiaoman is at the peak of the peak.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,040
Take an hour off.

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,319
What?

86
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,079
Training.

87
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,040
Spread your feet shoulder-width apart.

88
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,560
Squat in half

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
swing with one hand.

90
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,079
Swing it.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,079
You should hit your hand straight.

92
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,519
Press down with wrist.

93
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,639
Come on.

94
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,800
Clench your hands and straighten them.

95
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,720
Right.

96
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,519
Swing slowly.

97
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,600
Swing it slowly.

98
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,480
Look at the direction of the racket

99
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
turn it with the strength of your waist

100
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:29,959
swing it.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,600
Hand.

102
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,399
Don't be so stiff.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Don't teach me if you can't.

104
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
I'll practice by myself.

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,319
I mustn't look at indecent things.

106
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
Your brother has something?

107
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,240
My brother

108
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,920
Is that a possibility to win?

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,560
I've known your brother for so many years.

110
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,839
And his judgment

111
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,160
and never made a mistake.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,639
You mean he can win?

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,720
No, he won't.

114
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,199
What I mean is that

115
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,279
we are about to witness

116
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,319
his first mistake.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,519
Yeah!

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,639
We won!

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Yeah!

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
Sister.

121
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,319
Just do what you did last time.

122
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,279
Why don't you just be a spy?

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,879
Why are you suddenly doing this

124
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,720
with my brother?

125
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,639
This is a matter of honor or disgrace.

126
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,839
It won't be easy

127
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,920
won't be able to hide anymore.

128
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Are you

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,759
the Olympic champion suddenly took over?

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,279
Or are you trying to

131
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,920
to fool us?

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,279
Great master produces great disciples.

133
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,040
When you take him in, he has to cultivate himself

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,199
that's because I'm clever.

135
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,199
She knows how to do it right away.

136
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,199
Here comes the third round.

137
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,800
I'm already incredulous.

138
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,680
Come on.

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,399
Darn it.

140
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Be careful

141
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,120
are you alright?

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,919
I am fine.

143
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm relieved.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Lie down more if you feel comfortable.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,320
Are you all right, little boy?

146
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
Are you all right?

147
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,919
How could you play basketball?

148
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,240
Can't they see?

149
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,159
That your child

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,639
broke into the stadium.

151
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,679
We didn't notice him.

152
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,919
But I don't think he was hurt.

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
He's in shock.

154
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,039
I'm in shock.

155
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,759
That's easy for you to say.

156
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,320
I will bring him

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,919
I'll take him to the hospital.

158
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,200
If there is a little problem,

159
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,799
I won't spare you!

160
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,799
Dad, don't be angry with me.

161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,600
It was you who saved me.

162
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,919
I won't make you worried!

163
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,399
Come on!

164
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,039
Stop!

165
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,919
Here is the tennis court.

166
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,519
Children must

167
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,799
must be accompanied by an adult

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
an adult must be with him.

169
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
As her guardian,

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,759
you failed to fulfill your duty.

171
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,679
She even blamed

172
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,879
on a few years old.

173
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,320
A decades-old girl. How dare you?

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,799
Don't you know

175
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,840
an accident is very likely

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,159
she's very likely to be in an accident.

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,919
What kind of parents are you?

178
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,279
If an accident happens,

179
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,840
his life would be ruined.

180
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,000
Little Su.

181
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
As a public figure,

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
It's bad if anyone sees this.

183
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Brother, where are you going?

184
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,559
Back home.

185
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,720
It is all because you acted without permission.

186
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,039
He died because of you.

187
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Come in.

188
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,240
Undress?

189
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,919
What to take off?

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,960
You didn't look well just now.

191
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,200
What are you doing?

192
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,240
Didn't you hurt your back?

193
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm fine. No need to be nervous.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,639
You can't.

195
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,360
You were injured because of me.

196
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
I must take full responsibility.

197
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,519
That you have to accept.

198
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,039
No need.

199
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
I know what to do.

200
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
I'll give you two choices.

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,120
One is

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,919
I'll check it for you.

203
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,519
Second...

204
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,799
Let me read it for you.

205
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,279
I'll choose three.

206
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,159
No need to read it.

207
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,159
Aunt Hua.

208
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,519
Take a seat.

209
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,039
There are several bruises on your back.

210
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,519
Do you feel those bruises?

211
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,799
Is there anything wrong with your bones?

212
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,559
Your bones should be fine.

213
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,399
You should rub these bruises

214
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,279
let me rub them with safflower oil.

215
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,639
Hang in there.

216
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,440
You have to

217
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
to be effective.

218
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,960
My brother...

219
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,120
He probably remembered

220
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,480
his unhappy childhood again.

221
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,600
He doesn't want to talk about it,

222
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,919
so I can't tell you.

223
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,799
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

224
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,399
My brother is invincible.

225
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,840
He will be fine soon.

226
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,399
So,

227
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,519
what happened to you?

228
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,559
All right.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Put on your clothes.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're injured, too?

231
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,320
Let me help you.

232
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,600
No, it's just a scratch. It's fine.

233
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,679
I can do it myself.

234
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,200
The gauze is also unnecessary, right?

235
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
This isn't a bandage.

236
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I think this is just dressing the mummy.

237
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
People who don't know

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,799
I thought your hands

239
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,720
are beyond recognition.

240
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,720
Open it for me.

241
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
No way.

242
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,399
This is my brother's love for you.

243
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,480
On the other hand,

244
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,559
did my brother

245
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,279
fall in love with you?

246
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,399
You know how to joke.

247
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,600
Your brother proposed to me.

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,879
Of course it's true love.

249
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,200
Sister-in-law, let me tell you a secret.

250
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,039
The thing between you and my brother

251
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,039
your relationship with my brother.

252
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,480
You

253
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,519
that's me.

254
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,240
Who chose you to be in love with my brother.

255
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
The chief director and scriptwriter are all mine.

256
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
So you can tell me

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,799
the progress you've made, right?

258
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,159
The progress we've made

259
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,320
no progress?

260
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
It's impossible.

261
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
The moment

262
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,279
the rest of your eyes.

263
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,399
You can't escape the eyes

264
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,320
of the god of love.

265
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,320
Well, I'm sure you'll make progress.

266
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,039
Thank you for your compliment

267
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,679
that only proves

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,639
my acting skill

269
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,440
has reached a higher level.

270
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,559
He can look real like a real man.

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,840
Do you have a good feeling

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,919
don't you have

273
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,039
his heart racing...

274
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,519
He's throbbing.

275
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,919
Move.

276
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,120
There must be.

277
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
After I saw you, right?

278
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,960
Not really.

279
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm thinking about other things.

280
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,679
What is it?

281
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,039
I'm thinking

282
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
you seemed to hate me very much before.

283
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,360
But why did you choose me

284
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,639
your brother and I pretend to be a couple?

285
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,639
Since we're already friends,

286
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,600
then I can

287
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,440
I'll be frank with you.

288
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,279
I didn't like you at all before.

289
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
I think you're fake and pretentious.

290
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
The reason I chose you

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
and dated my brother

292
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,000
just because you focus on your career

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
unlike other women

294
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
she pounced on my brother when she saw him.

295
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
Was he that popular?

296
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,320
I wrote

297
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,039
love stories,

298
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,639
they'll arrange for you

299
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,519
have lunch

300
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,559
and watch a movie.

301
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,919
An ordinary story.

302
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,399
He did it

303
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,559
to prevent you and my brother

304
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,559
between you and my brother.

305
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,360
But this is different now.

306
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
I know you aren't a white flower

307
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,279
some hypocritical little flower.

308
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:04,720
It is a king flower

309
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,879
a shining Overlord Flower.

310
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,039
I like you so much now.

311
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,440
I sincerely wish you

312
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,320
I hope that you and my brother

313
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
develop true feelings.

314
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

315
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,759
You won't be mad at me, right?

316
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Don't worry.

317
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,879
I'm a broad-minded person.

318
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,840
I won't take it to heart.

319
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,440
That's great!

320
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
I really regret it.

321
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,799
If I saw through your mask

322
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,559
through your mask early,

323
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,559
maybe you and my brother

324
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,200
are married.

325
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
This family is terrifying.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,799
That fancy dress is urging her to get married.

327
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,840
Although the wine is good, don't drink too much.

328
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,720
Barbecue?

329
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,759
It smells so good.

330
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,919
Don't move.

331
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,039
Brat, what are you doing?

332
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,759
Your hand is hurt like this.

333
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,080
Why didn't you come to take care of her?

334
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,840
What did mom tell you?

335
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
You should treat your girlfriend

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,759
to her as warm as a spring.

337
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,320
You need to learn to love her, to care for her,

338
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,440
and cherish her.

339
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,840
Mom, don't worry.

340
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,799
I will take good care

341
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,120
to take good care of Xiao Jin.

342
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,200
Is it good?

343
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,519
Come on, one more bite.

344
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,480
You should

345
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,679
If he doesn't listen to me,

346
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,759
you can tell Aunt Hua

347
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,919
just eat.

348
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,559
Huron, I want some.

349
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,960
You're quite good at ordering people around.

350
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,960
Great.

351
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,840
And strawberries.

352
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,159
Bring the salad.

353
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
And this melon

354
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,159
more salad.

355
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,720
More skewers, please.

356
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
Feed it to me.

357
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,159
My mom isn't here. It's good.

358
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,039
Aunt Hua.

359
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,080
Nothing, Mom.

360
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,240
You won't have what you are today.

361
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,639
Forget about it.

362
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,360
I'll endure this.

363
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,399
I suddenly have a bad feeling.

364
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,639
These two days,

365
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,000
watching her these two days.

366
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,240
Will she

367
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,480
gain some weight

368
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
you won't fit into this gown.

369
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,159
It should be

370
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,919
really?

371
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Be careful. It's hot.

372
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,759
What are you doing?

373
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,240
Wiping your mouth.

374
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,920
Mr. Mu,

375
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,440
do you think that

376
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,160
mr. Mu,

377
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,119
here's a friendly hint,

378
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,200
you must not be tempted

379
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,880
be attracted to your business partner.

380
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,519
Miss Su,

381
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,079
how should I reply?

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Sorry to disturb you, Boss.

383
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,039
I can do it myself.

384
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,079
Don't move.

385
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,000
Come here!

386
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,680
Go right now.

387
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,519
Boss, I can come by myself.

388
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,960
You don't have to put on so much acting.

389
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,160
Nervous now?

390
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,160
I...

391
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Mom.

392
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,799
Huron.

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,680
It's okay. Eat more.

394
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Did Mr. Mu return?

395
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
What did she say?

396
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,359
Isn't that good?

397
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,799
And my heart

398
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,119
didn't come as a shock.

399
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,440
The day does not fall and the air gets drunk

400
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,839
rain never stops. Wind never stops. I miss everyone.

401
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,359
It's the fish-fragrant shredded pork.

402
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,160
Wrapped up my taste buds.

403
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Fish leaves the water,

404
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,599
♫ Breath turns to exhaustion ♫

405
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,039
♫ Who is the one in the wrong? ♫

406
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,640
You were so lowly.

407
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,000
Alright.

408
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,039
What do you think, sister-in-law?

409
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Don't you think it's beautiful?

410
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,000
Do you have the feeling of your heart?

411
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
Nothing.

412
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
They all said that to hear Mr. Mu sing,

413
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,519
he's really an immortal.

414
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,759
For three days.

415
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,079
It can be a magnificent audio-visual feast.

416
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,359
Keep a low profile.

417
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,759
About flattering me

418
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,359
don't take it seriously.

419
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,359
How about this?

420
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,599
Let Xiaojin give us

421
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,160
a professional performance!

422
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
Alright?

423
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
Mu Huron.

424
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
You did it on purpose.

425
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm screwed.

426
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
With everyone watching,

427
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,079
how can I fool her?

428
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,279
Jinqing.

429
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,279
Sister, this secret might be

430
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,480
to keep this secret anymore.

431
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,200
Wait!

432
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,160
It's a secret.

433
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,400
Little Jin.

434
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,559
There are horns on my head.

435
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,200
And tails behind me.

436
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,200
No one knows

437
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,039
I have a lot of secrets.

438
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,359
I won't ever tell you

439
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,119
I won't ever tell you

440
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
I won't ever tell you

441
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,559
this child.

442
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,880
Little Jin is such a good singer.

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,279
Wish you every success!

444
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:42,680
Come on.

445
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,599
I remember this song.

446
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank you, Little Dragon.

447
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
How is it, brother?

448
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,119
Are you overwhelmed by

449
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,880
of your cuteness?

450
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,359
What if

451
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,440
If she had known

452
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
what happened to you last night?

453
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,559
Brother, I was wrong.

454
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Get Mom away from us!

455
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,319
Yes, Your Majesty!

456
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:07,880
Mother.

457
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,440
Let's go to karaoke.

458
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,799
Come on.

459
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,359
Come on.

460
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
Let's choose one too.

461
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,519
Have some first.

462
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,839
I'll choose Daqinglong.

463
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,640
Sister-in-law.

464
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,920
Second Uncle.

465
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,359
Isn't that Xiaoman?

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,680
Look what I've got for you.

467
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,880
The limited-edition handmade gift that I want the most.

468
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,039
Thank you, Second Uncle.

469
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Go on.

470
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:30,960
She's just a kid.

471
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
You even wasted her money.

472
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,559
Second Uncle.

473
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,240
Second Uncle!

474
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,799
Minguang,

475
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,000
It's late. Why are you suddenly here?

476
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
I have something to discuss

477
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,839
to discuss with her.

478
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,759
Second Uncle, go in.

479
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Sister-in-law.

480
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,039
I'll go in first.

481
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,759
Go on.

482
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,240
This is the agreement to acquire Espy.

483
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,799
Now the executives of the company

484
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,200
have signed the agreement.

485
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,599
I'm here today

486
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,160
to ask

487
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,000
the reason for refusing my visa?

488
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,319
In the due diligence report

489
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,720
In the due diligence report

490
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
In the due diligence report.

491
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,160
The actual operating conditions

492
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,960
Is greatly different from the published financial results.

493
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,799
And

494
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:10,680
there are also

495
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,160
Is also problematic.

496
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,039
I can't sign it at the moment.

497
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,559
Don't you know

498
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400
that many enterprises

499
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,160
keeping an eye on this company.

500
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,880
If we don't

501
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,359
the project now,

502
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,839
we will lose the initiative.

503
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,119
I think we should be

504
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,920
still need to be cautious.

505
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,160
If they rush into a merger agreement

506
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,920
just to seize the opportunity,

507
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,359
may cause irreparable losses

508
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,799
to Mu's Group.

509
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Do you mean that

510
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,200
me and the seniors of the company

511
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,119
are too old

512
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,519
you can't tell, right?

513
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,759
How could it be?

514
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,039
And gradually,

515
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,359
to where it is today.

516
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,359
I'm the only one who knows

517
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,400
what we need

518
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,640
rely on?

519
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,079
Boldness,

520
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,319
you dare to enter and do anything.

521
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,279
Someone like you who is yes to something

522
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,880
who fears the wolf and the tiger later,

523
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,839
and develop our company?

524
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,920
Will Mu's Group grow?

525
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,000
Mu's family is

526
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,039
are all my hard work.

527
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
We should not be rash advances,

528
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,960
these years,

529
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,839
In recent years.

530
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,880
The outside world has always

531
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
look at fiercely as a tiger does

532
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
If we act rashly

533
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,160
we act boldly,

534
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,160
we might end up winning

535
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
with a thoughtful person.

536
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,920
The Mu family

537
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,839
are all my life's work.

538
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,480
I really don't want

539
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,319
destroy Mu's Family.

540
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,279
Would I harm Mu's family?

541
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Kid, don't think

542
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,519
I'll be more polite to you,

543
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,480
and you forgot who you are.

544
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,039
I am the president of Mu's Group.

545
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,720
It concerns the future of Mu's Group.

546
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,599
We cannot concede this step.

547
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,960
But you have to think it through.

548
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,000
Why my brother

549
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,119
why did he give me the important business

550
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
of the company to me?

551
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
It should be

552
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,920
or I will ask you to come from

553
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
where you come from.

554
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,640
Sorry, Second Uncle.

555
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,319
You got burned, right?

556
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,359
Are you blind?

557
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,160
Second Uncle.

558
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,000
It was Little Jin.

559
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,480
She didn't do it on purpose.

560
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,920
Eldest Sister-in-law.

561
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,640
Are you alright?

562
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,440
Alright.

563
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Jin.

564
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,599
Is your hand hurt?

565
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
It's fine, Second Uncle.

566
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:37,880
Hurry up.

567
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,720
Open this for me.

568
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,799
I'm finally free.

569
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,599
It's already late, so don't leave.

570
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,559
And family reunion.

571
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,279
I'll get two bottles of good wine

572
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,079
let's drink them.

573
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,640
Alright.

574
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,559
Aunt Hua,

575
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,400
I still have work to do in the company,

576
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,119
I'll leave now.

577
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,440
Okay. Be careful.

578
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,279
It's Minguang.

579
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
Huron is still young after all.

580
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,160
In the future,

581
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,680
In the company

582
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,519
In the future.

583
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,640
A toast to you.

584
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,640
Aunt Hua.

585
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,880
I think Huron

586
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,279
Is already very good.

587
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,000
He doesn't need any help

588
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,480
from others.

589
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,720
And not to mention,

590
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,559
the new generation of the Yangtze River always pushes against the new.

591
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,319
People who are too old

592
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,599
Isn't necessarily great.

593
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,039
Sometimes

594
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,920
the one who grows up

595
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,400
doesn't necessarily mean seniority.

596
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,799
It could also be presbyopia.

597
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
Little Jin.

598
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,400
To be honest,

599
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,480
when he was young,

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
he got blurred eyes.

601
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,039
Sister-in-law, everything you say is right.

602
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,759
I think our family gathering

603
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,839
no business.

604
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,240
Alright.

605
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
Something personal.

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,039
Lun...

607
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
When are you two

608
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
are you going to get married?

609
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
When are you getting married?

610
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,680
None of your business.

611
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,440
It's almost time, Second Uncle.

612
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,720
He's such a busybody.

613
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,480
It's almost time.

614
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,480
Our Mu family

615
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,799
had a small population.

616
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,680
When I was alive,

617
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,400
to get married soon

618
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,559
the sooner you get married,

619
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,720
and marry the third generation soon.

620
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,279
Does it mean that

621
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,039
that Xiaojin doesn't want to have children?

622
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,920
If I didn't show you what I'm capable of,

623
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,039
I think you're treating me like a sick cat.

624
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,640
Sister-in-law.

625
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,160
The young people

626
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,960
are not what they were then.

627
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,839
Especially when Xiaojin

628
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,400
her career is rising.

629
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,880
And she's an actress.

630
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,319
They focus on body image,

631
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,079
not their children.

632
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,759
Come on.

633
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,279
That's not what Little Jin thinks.

634
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,000
Right?

635
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,319
It's not my fault not to get married.

636
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,359
Because of you.

637
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,799
Huron always told me

638
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
second Uncle, you've been working hard for the company.

639
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,799
He should learn more from you.

640
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,319
Well then,

641
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,119
you're not going to have children

642
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,880
even at such a young age.

643
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,079
That's not a good start for us.

644
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:41,799
Can my Huron

645
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,319
hurry to get married?

646
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,759
And Second Uncle.

647
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,279
Actually, I always thought

648
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,240
you are the kind of gentleman

649
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,480
that doesn't care about your family background.

650
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,960
But today I found

651
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,920
you care so much

652
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,359
about our reproduction?

653
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,799
Then I realized I misunderstood.

654
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,920
I was finally able to speak my mind freely.

655
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,160
Second Uncle.

656
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,160
Do you have any reasons

657
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,359
do you have something hard to tell?

658
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,519
Don't be shy.

659
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,160
We are one family.

660
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,759
If you have any difficulties,

661
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,480
please share your feelings.

662
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,119
If you tell it,

663
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:09,839
we'll help you together

664
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,960
together.

665
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
Don't you care about this?

666
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,279
So that you can regain your strength as soon as possible.

667
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,880
Second Uncle, are you sick?

668
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Play your games.

669
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,000
I think I'm a little drunk, Huron.

670
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,319
Hurry and escort me to my room.

671
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:22,559
Alright.

672
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,240
Second Uncle, take your time.

673
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,200
Hurry back to have a rest.

674
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
I'm sorry, Second Uncle.

675
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,119
Sister-in-law.

676
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,119
I'll rest, too.

677
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:31,920
The Minguang?

678
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,039
His Second Uncle...

679
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,519
Mum, what's wrong with Second Uncle?

680
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,440
You're still a child.

681
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
Don't ask too many questions.

682
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,599
Stop acting.

683
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm saving you from troubles, okay?

684
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,279
What the hell?

685
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,079
What?

686
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,359
Nothing.

687
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,319
Go for a walk.

688
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,599
You scared me.

689
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,119
I need a drink to calm me down.

690
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
I don't usually drink.

691
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,839
Drinking makes people lose control.

692
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
And trigger a nervous reaction.

693
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,839
And alcohol intoxication can also be caused,

694
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:06,839
and harm your liver and kidneys.

695
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,839
You can choose either alcohol or milk.

696
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,359
After acting with Second Uncle for so long,

697
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,599
take it easy.

698
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,559
Alright.

699
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,519
You don't drink. That's good.

700
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,839
Speaking of which,

701
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,200
well, Second Uncle,

702
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,279
what happened?

703
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
I didn't mean to

704
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,319
to gossip about your private matter.

705
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
I think

706
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,400
we are now

707
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,240
In the war.

708
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,839
I have the right to know the situation of the enemy.

709
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,680
It's convenient for me to take action later.

710
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,400
Forget it if you don't want to talk about it.

711
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
You drank too much.

712
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,000
Nothing.

713
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,079
Never played it before.

714
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,519
Curious.

715
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,279
Didn't you go to the amusement park

716
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,079
didn't your parents take you to the amusement park?

717
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,480
Did you learn when you were little?

718
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,559
That rich kids

719
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,279
like this?

720
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm not some

721
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,599
who lives in a rich family

722
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,680
what do you mean?

723
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,039
My surname is not Mu at all.

724
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,039
When I was little,

725
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,880
I was adopted

726
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,839
from a welfare home.

727
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,839
They gave me a sister

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
they gave me a home.

729
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,880
They gave me

730
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,720
that I've never felt before.

731
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,799
That's why

732
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,119
I swore since I was a child

733
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,920
I will be a real man

734
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,640
and protect them.

735
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
That's why?

736
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,799
As a real man,

737
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
never play

738
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,279
play this kind of kid stuff.

739
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,039
Mom.

740
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,839
Mother.

741
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,119
Mother.

742
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,759
Mom is here when I'm small.

743
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,519
Don't be scared.

744
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll be by your side.

745
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,839
Listen carefully.

746
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,759
From now on,

747
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,400
you're not the president,

748
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,440
you're no one's son

749
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,279
or brother of anyone.

750
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
That's you.

751
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,279
The one and only.

752
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,279
We are

753
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,279
we need to punish the bad guys.

754
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,039
Punish the bad guys.

755
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,640
How?

756
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,799
Have you heard of a kind of insects?

757
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,160
Once it touches the skin,

758
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,839
It'll be swollen and itchy.

759
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,279
That's why

760
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,799
on your second uncle's quilt.

761
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,240
Childish.

762
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,680
Where are we supposed to find him?

763
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,119
This way.

764
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,880
He seems to be sleeping.

765
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,240
He got away.

766
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,599
Hold on.

767
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
It seems his coat

768
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,440
In the living room.

769
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,799
How about

770
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,920
let's put the bug

771
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,000
to the coat.

772
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,440
Isn't this a little too much?

773
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,319
This is too much.

774
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
But I like that.

775
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,359
Who is it?

776
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,000
Are you alright?

777
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,240
Look at the moon.

778
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,880
The moon

779
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,000
was exactly the same as

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
as like as two peas

781
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,359
big and round.

782
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,119
I know what.

783
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,119
The stars seem to be

784
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,000
the same as I saw when I was little.

785
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,599
We're counting the stars.

786
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,880
OK.

787
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
One.

788
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,119
-Two. -Let's go.

789
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,680
Nine-one.

790
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,920
Ninety two.

791
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,400
Ninety three.

792
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,440
Nine four.

793
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,319
Nine five.

794
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,920
Ninety six.

795
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,240
Ninety seven.

796
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,039
Nine-eight.

797
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,559
9.

798
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
You promised

799
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,840
to stay.

800
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,079
Why haven't they done anything?

801
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,920
No idea what

802
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,880
I've prepared for them

803
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,760
are they used?

804
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,159
Mom.

805
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,719
What have you prepared?

806
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,559
Mom, you are really...

807
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,880
Creative.

808
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
With your support,

809
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,599
according to the usual practice,

810
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,280
they'll be furious,

811
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,039
and full of passion.

812
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,719
And full of affection.

813
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,599
You

814
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,000
and be your sister-in-law.

815
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,880
Xiaoman,

816
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,960
do you think

817
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,360
to decorate the baby's room

818
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,519
to decorate the nursery?

819
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,280
Mother.

820
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,440
You want to be a grandma, don't you?

821
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,639
Check your phone.

822
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Mu Huron.

823
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,800
Get up!

824
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,480
Why were you in my bed

825
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,559
for the whole night.

826
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,320
Please stop.

827
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,440
Did you cheat me

828
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,360
that you're going to

829
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
you took off my clothes.

830
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
With the heavy smell of alcohol

831
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,599
for the whole night.

832
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,559
You can do it, but I can't.

833
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,159
Alright, Mu Huron.

834
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,000
I didn't expect that

835
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,480
It turns out you're such a person.

836
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,639
Huron.

837
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,000
Little Jin.

838
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,880
Are you awake?

839
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,639
Please cooperate.

840
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
I think

841
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,119
she has left already?

842
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:02,920
Then...

843
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,719
Can you let go now?

844
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,280
I was...

845
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,679
Lest she might strike back.

846
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,480
Let's wait a little longer.

847
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,239
Xiaoman, breakfast time.

848
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,039
Last night?

849
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,000
Nothing happened last night.

850
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,719
Xiaoman changed your clothes for you.

851
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,280
I don't have that kind of hobby.

852
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,000
That's good if you're not.

853
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,920
So that we won't

854
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,000
to our relationship.

855
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,400
Your mental state

856
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,920
are pretty good.

857
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,440
Had a good sleep last night?

858
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,280
You are talkative.

859
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,719
Don't talk too much.

860
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,639
Eat up.

861
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:25,760
Huron.

862
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,199
Bring me the milk.

863
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,159
What am I thinking?

864
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,239
Stop it.

865
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,440
What are you thinking?

866
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,679
Nothing.

867
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,880
By the way, Mom,

868
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,199
xiao Jin and I will go back

869
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,360
with Xiaojin.

870
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,039
Xiao Jin,

871
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,239
no matter how busy you are,

872
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,360
take good care of yourself.

873
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,559
Ask Huron for help if you need any help.

874
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,639
Don't be shy with him.

875
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,480
Alright.

876
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,920
Mom.

877
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,079
This omelet is good.

878
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,719
Then you should have more.

879
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,880
It's still growing.

880
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,440
That's good if you're not.

881
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,519
So that we won't

882
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,440
to our relationship.

883
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm causing trouble!

884
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,519
Who's troubling whom?

885
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
I have no interest

886
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,480
In you.

887
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,599
Got it?

888
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,360
Nothing.

889
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,320
Huron.

890
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,840
Huron?
