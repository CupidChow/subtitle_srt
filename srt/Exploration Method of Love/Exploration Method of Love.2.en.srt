1
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,079
Dating is not limited to holding hands.

2
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,840
Hug and physical interaction.

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,079
To stay overnight at home.

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,239
Miss Su, are you trying to

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
want to terminate the contract again?

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,239
This kind of cooperation

7
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,120
Is definitely not to

8
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,239
urging me to get married.

9
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,159
I think he wants to use

10
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,599
to cash Su Jin's money

11
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,519
for your own benefit.

12
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,439
What's so complicated?

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,879
Hey.

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,599
Sister.

15
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,759
Deep-Fried Chicken with Chili Pepper

16
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
he sends us

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,479
to live stream.

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
Fried chicken.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,879
The most popular fried chicken chain

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,439
In the whole network.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,479
Their live-stream studio

22
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,159
only invite the hottest stars

23
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,240
with the hottest celebrities

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
to try out new products.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,639
The popularity of our anti-proposal

26
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,000
Is too great.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,159
So they want us to attend it.

28
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,159
Got it.

29
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,120
That looks so delicious.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Miss Su,

31
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,479
you are right.

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,080
The one invited by the live stream

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,479
to be with Mr. Mu

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,680
and were broadcast live under the name of Splendid China.

35
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,879
As for the fried chicken company,

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
the investor behind the scenes

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
Is Mu's Group.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,879
They really want to

39
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,120
to make money by using Xiaojin.

40
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,240
Forget it. Let's reject it.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,800
Not really.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Not only will I go

43
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,599
but also to renew my contract.

44
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,680
Right now,

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,199
Is drafting a new contract now.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
Take back all the things

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
that should be ours.

48
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,240
Have I

49
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,400
make yourself clear, right?

50
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,080
You should have

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
to make it clear to her earlier.

52
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,719
She has a good temper.

53
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,919
Lively and outgoing.

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,759
I also like that.

55
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,680
To marry you?

56
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,400
Alright.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,199
If the two of you

58
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,120
are having a fight,

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,280
I'll be relieved.

60
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,919
After you get married,

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,560
the property

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,360
will have to be redistributed

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
according to law.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,639
I need to check the Company Succession Law.

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,439
I'll leave you two alone.

66
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,520
The trending topic.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
How did Su Jin propose?

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,080
Why is no one

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
about this script?

70
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,120
She told me

71
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
Is because of my career transformation.

72
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,719
What's that for?

73
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,319
Do you believe that?

74
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,199
Come on. Look at me.

75
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,439
When a girl

76
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,120
who suddenly starts to

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,280
to change herself.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,639
That must be

79
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,879
you have a crush on someone.

80
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
She's into you.

81
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,719
To catch your attention.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,960
Who is your sweetheart?

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,919
My heart

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,080
this is it.

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,520
Hey.

86
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,159
It's over.

87
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,560
In the future.

88
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,599
All right, young lady.

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,919
I have a meeting.

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,479
I'll leave now.

91
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,680
Brother Gao Ling.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,080
See you later.

93
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,879
Join Su Jin and you will broadcast live

94
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,920
live selling fried chicken.

95
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
If you continue fooling around with Xiaoman,

96
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,920
you'll have your year-end bonus deducted for three months.

97
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,040
This time, I didn't.

98
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,720
This company

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,480
of this company.

100
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,040
They said

101
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,279
If you show up together,

102
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,519
their profit will double.

103
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,720
When did I invest in this company?

104
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,600
This company.

105
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,279
Three years ago,

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,399
I ordered fried chicken for you.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
You said the sweetness of their tomato sauce

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
the sweetness of their ketchup.

109
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,519
And let me support you.

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,399
Then I'll help you

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
one million yuan in the capital.

112
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,319
Now they are

113
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,040
a nationwide chain

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,079
and it has become an internet celebrity.

115
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,120
Reject it.

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,199
Reject it.

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,720
High altitude.

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,399
Please remember.

119
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,000
I never eat

120
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
never eat sweet fried chicken.

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,040
I remembered it wrong.

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,160
Miss Su,

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
confirmed?

124
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,879
Mr. Mu is too busy

125
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
and cancel this live stream.

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Why?

127
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,680
The reason isn't important.

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,519
The important thing is

129
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,639
that we can do

130
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,000
do a couple's live streaming,

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,920
to be a couple?

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,439
No, it's not.

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,759
Then I should be more active.

134
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:34,920
If he doesn't come,

135
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
I'll still be able to make a scene.

136
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,519
That I'm worthy of his contract renewal

137
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,519
that I deserve him to renew his contract.

138
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,360
Of his renewing my contract.

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,199
Right?

140
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,199
However,

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,040
enough.

142
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
I know what you're worried about.

143
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
You're worried

144
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,199
exposing my identity

145
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,000
will Su Jin's image

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,439
will further collapse?

147
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,600
Fang Xie,

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
I did promise you

149
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,319
I can play Su Jin

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,639
but you have to remember

151
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
I am not Jinqing.

152
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,759
I would never be able to act

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,160
the Su Jin that you created.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,639
Sister Su.

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,240
Then I...

156
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,600
Youyou, lunch is here.

157
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,360
Alright?

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
I'll check the process.

159
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:09,920
Xiao Xia,

160
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,079
we have another?

161
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
There are.

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,560
Pick whatever you like.

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,519
Nothing else but these.

164
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,439
Youyou,

165
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,959
I thought you only had salad

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,720
for lunch?

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,639
That's why I didn't prepare anything else.

168
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,040
Don't worry. It's your fault.

169
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,199
I don't have an appetite today.

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
I won't eat now.

171
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,639
Shan.

172
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,639
Refine your makeup.

173
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Everything is arranged accordingly.

174
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,319
I don't even have the freedom to eat.

175
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,480
And the company works like crazy.

176
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
No wonder you're tired.

177
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,879
Don't worry.

178
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,519
I'll pay you

179
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll earn it for you.

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,360
Sis,

181
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
be happy.

182
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,959
I'll have fried chicken

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
during the live stream later.

184
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,759
Shan.

185
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,680
How about we change

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,600
for a new makeup today?

187
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,079
Come. Stop a moment.

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Come here, everybody.

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,959
Our live guest

190
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,879
has changed.

191
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
The live streaming proposal has changed.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,199
Let's go and get familiar with them.

193
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,720
Are you sure to ask these questions?

194
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,160
What if she gets angry

195
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,720
she is angry?

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
Su Jin is famous for her good temper.

197
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,199
How can she be angry?

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,079
Brother, Su Jin is here.

199
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,720
Are you sure it's a sweet white flower?

200
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,560
Hi, everyone.

201
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
This is Su Jin.

202
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,279
The hit live studio.

203
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,199
Sent here.

204
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,959
Right, I forgot to tell you that

205
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,959
their headquarters

206
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,920
Is on the 20th floor.

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,879
Su Jin will be there for the live broadcast.

208
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,759
Not interested.

209
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,759
You can get off work now.

210
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,079
Alright.

211
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,279
Su Jin,

212
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,160
I asked you to go and check

213
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,879
xiaoman's situation.

214
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,439
What?

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,639
You've got the result now

216
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,839
and report it to me now?

217
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,439
See you

218
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,759
childish!

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,279
Wow, it's amazing.

220
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,639
The first batch of purchasing vouchers

221
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,559
were all sold

222
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
the daigou coupons.

223
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,200
This is live streaming.

224
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Thank you all

225
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,159
Isn't it awkward?

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,480
Little Jin.

227
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,639
Look at the machine in front.

228
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,039
Yes, that's right ahead.

229
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,120
Hi, everyone.

230
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,799
We originally

231
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,879
not only Xiao Jin,

232
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,039
she also invited her boyfriend

233
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,799
to come with her.

234
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,120
But unfortunately,

235
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
In the end,

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
mr. Mu couldn't be here

237
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,879
could you please reveal

238
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,000
the reason?

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,919
He's too busy.

240
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:03,919
I'm sorry

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
I let you down.

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,200
I'll bring him here

243
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,360
I'll take him here next time.

244
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,559
Brother.

245
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,799
This anchor asked.

246
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,679
Was different from

247
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,639
as what we wrote in the playscript.

248
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,799
Before this,

249
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,120
was in the trending topic

250
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,240
In the trending topic.

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,639
We are all curious about

252
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,840
why Xiaojin made such a choice

253
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,879
such a choice?

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,759
Xiaojin seems very anxious.

255
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Why is it me who proposed?

256
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,759
First of all,

257
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,759
the fact that I raised this issue

258
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,720
It already shows

259
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,799
you set a frame

260
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,080
for your ideas.

261
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,320
What makes you propose?

262
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,679
It has to be the man.

263
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,639
We shouldn't label men

264
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,240
being active or passive

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
active and passive.

266
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,639
I think two people together

267
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,440
they have to explore

268
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,600
an emotional mode

269
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
of their own.

270
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
They're comfortable being together.

271
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,399
To be together?

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
After all, in this era,

273
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
to meet someone

274
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,080
that wants you to propose.

275
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,919
That wants you to propose

276
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,840
to have a crush on him.

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,279
Right?

278
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,519
The shy president's brother.

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,240
Hey.

280
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Does it seem naive of me

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,399
am I too childish?

282
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,919
What Xiao Jin said is very good.

283
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,759
I really agree with you.

284
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,399
Su Jin,

285
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
your transformation

286
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
be based

287
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,679
the collapse of my image?

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,840
No way!

289
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,519
I'll show them

290
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,320
what truly

291
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
the true glamour of men.

292
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,279
How can I lose?

293
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
With Xiaojin recently.

294
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,039
We're going to

295
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,679
the real theme

296
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,679
the real theme today.

297
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,360
As the taste of

298
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,120
taste new products today,

299
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,759
the fried chicken,

300
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,200
please bring the fried chicken

301
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
please serve the fried chicken.

302
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
It seems that Xiao Jin is very happy.

303
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,559
More than talking about your boyfriend.

304
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,879
Of course. This is

305
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,399
I'm looking forward to the most today.

306
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,879
I can't wait another second.

307
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,799
What's up

308
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,039
why did my brother

309
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,360
going to Su Jin's live streaming?

310
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
Come here. Hurry up.

311
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
Come on!

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,879
Come here.

313
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Mr. Mu, what are you doing here?

314
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,759
Can rest assured.

315
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,480
Let me handle the business here.

316
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,279
Can you do that?

317
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Certainly.

318
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,399
I fried chicken for the first few rounds.

319
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,639
All seconds left.

320
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,440
You can't.

321
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,240
What do you mean?

322
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,399
Everyone, you can see this.

323
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,039
I'm as excited as you are.

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,720
Come on, Mr. Mu.

325
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,879
Hurry up and greet

326
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,559
to my family now.

327
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright.

328
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,559
Hello, everyone. I am Mu Huron.

329
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,799
The fiancé of Miss Su Jin.

330
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Hold on.

331
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
My hair is stuck.

332
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,039
That's much better.

333
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,919
What an impressive acting skill.

334
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,799
He's had a mouthful of dog food.

335
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
That's so happy!

336
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
Our fried chicken

337
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
Is ready.

338
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,120
Now, please

339
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,279
try our new products.

340
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,960
And then give our babies

341
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,000
our babies.

342
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,480
Alright.

343
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,200
Here, I can help you.

344
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,840
I heard that

345
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,639
eating fried chicken

346
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,679
with your beloved,

347
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,799
you'll be happier.

348
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,200
Come on.

349
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm coming.

350
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,240
Female artist.

351
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,919
You can't eat fried chicken like that?

352
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
Look how delicious it is.

353
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,240
Slow down.

354
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,360
I rubbed my mouth.

355
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,279
Come on.

356
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,559
Is that so greasy?

357
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,039
Brother.

358
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm gone.

359
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,879
It seems

360
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,519
unlock other new attributes

361
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,360
you unlock other new attributes.

362
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,519
Me too.

363
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,159
And I have been holding

364
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,200
for three years.

365
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,720
As an entertainer,

366
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,320
please take care of your body, okay?

367
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,039
I can't watch this live stream anymore.

368
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,559
Su Jin must have put on a lot of weight recently.

369
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,159
Why don't you feel that?

370
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
You are so fat.

371
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
He ate so much even in live stream.

372
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
I've become

373
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,519
laugh and grow fat

374
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,679
but I think that everyone should

375
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,919
don't live with the labels

376
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,159
the labels that were put on you.

377
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,159
You should never live up to

378
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,039
other people's taste.

379
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,039
If you want to eat,

380
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,200
the most important thing is to be happy.

381
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,039
Mr. Mu, do you agree

382
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,080
of Xiaojin?

383
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,639
Certainly.

384
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
You can eat whatever

385
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,919
want to eat.

386
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,320
After all, being healthy

387
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,759
a good health is the most important.

388
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,279
Right?

389
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,440
He's here again.

390
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,320
That's right.

391
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,559
He must be so strong.

392
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,000
What about us?

393
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,480
(Don't be afraid)

394
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,799
I'll get fat from eating fried chicken.

395
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,519
The right amount of fat intake

396
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,559
Is essential

397
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,399
to your health.

398
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,759
Such as fried chicken.

399
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,279
It won't gain weight,

400
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
It speeds up metabolism

401
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,679
and burns body fat.

402
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,360
I will recommend a tip

403
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
that won't get fat.

404
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,120
For example,

405
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,399
when we eat fried chicken,

406
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,919
In your mouth,

407
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,000
chew it for 30 times before swallowing.

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,039
In fact, just now everyone

409
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,039
didn't notice that.

410
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,759
I secretly

411
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,919
to swallow it

412
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,759
to swallow it, right?

413
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,679
Come, sweetheart.

414
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,000
Show us

415
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,960
the whole thing is yours

416
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,159
you can chew it for 30 times.

417
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,399
It's more disgusting.

418
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,200
Who can't?

419
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,000
You win.

420
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,159
Babies can also try

421
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,039
brother Gao Ling.

422
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,240
The novel I wrote.

423
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
How could they

424
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,320
change the script without permission?

425
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,159
Maybe we should

426
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,200
we're going to talk about your situation.

427
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,000
What happened

428
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,840
you, a little boy,

429
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,000
when do you learn

430
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
secretly dating someone?

431
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,759
I know it.

432
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
I know you lied to your brother.

433
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,600
With me?

434
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,960
You're busy with work.

435
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,480
I can't bother you

436
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,559
I won't bother you.

437
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,159
You've really grown up.

438
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,559
You know how to protect the one you love.

439
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,720
That's for sure.

440
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:33,919
To protect each other.

441
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,960
Is the first rule of love.

442
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,639
Haven't I done with the comments?

443
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,840
We're trying to add the keyword

444
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,399
to block them.

445
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
But to be honest,

446
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,960
the netizens are free to comment.

447
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,759
What's going on?

448
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,120
The fried chicken is sold out.

449
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,120
He even reserved one for next year.

450
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,399
The task has been completed.

451
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,519
Goodness.

452
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,000
Babies, you just can't believe it.

453
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
An anonymous user

454
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,320
already bought all our fried chicken

455
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,799
our fried chicken.

456
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,279
This fan said

457
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,960
he likes Little Jin very much.

458
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,919
He is a fan of Xiao Jin

459
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,120
and very supportive of you.

460
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,919
He said it was hard for Xiao Jin to do the live broadcast.

461
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
Let's all

462
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,799
thank you, Xiao Jin.

463
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,200
Thank you this fan.

464
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,679
We sold out the fried chicken

465
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,519
sold out in advance.

466
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,559
We have to end

467
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,080
ends early.

468
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Have you not had enough?

469
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,279
Then Xiao Jin should

470
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,399
would like to say a few words.

471
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,559
First of all,

472
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,120
thank you, my friend.

473
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,720
However,

474
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,759
I must tell you this.

475
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,200
"Consume sensibly."

476
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,519
Don't waste food.

477
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,960
Don't do that next time.

478
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,919
Stop eating.

479
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Stop eating.

480
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
Stop eating.

481
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,679
Thank you, Mr. Mu

482
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,639
for taking time out of your busy schedule to come here.

483
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,120
The live data

484
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
will be perfect.

485
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,639
There is still one month left.

486
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,440
How to manage Su Jin well.

487
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,559
I hope you know about this.

488
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,559
That's right.

489
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,639
Brother Fang!

490
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Little Su is missing.

491
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,559
I've looked for her everywhere.

492
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,279
Yes

493
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,919
with the fried chicken?

494
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,559
Go find her.

495
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,240
One piece of fried chicken weighs three kilograms.

496
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,159
Hurry up.

497
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,960
Go for it.

498
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
We won't win.

499
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
Turn the tables.

500
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,039
Little Su.

501
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,279
Sister Su.

502
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,279
Ancestor.

503
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,920
Where are you?

504
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,559
You can't stop eating fried chicken.

505
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Mu Xiaoman,

506
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,440
come here.

507
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,160
Brother.

508
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,519
Calm down.

509
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm a university graduate.

510
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,720
You can't expect me to follow your lead

511
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
the same as you.

512
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:36,839
I...

513
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,039
You mentioned that

514
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,319
the sudden change in style

515
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,359
probably because she likes me.

516
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,200
You have a fever.

517
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,599
You actually know how to use

518
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,640
maybe the word

519
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,720
In the form of questions.

520
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
To prove that a girl

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
If she likes herself.

522
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,119
Su Jin can reach

523
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,720
reach such a level.

524
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,400
Tell me what

525
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
what happened?

526
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,519
Otherwise you are really hopeless.

527
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
It seems she's really something.

528
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,440
She's very beautiful.

529
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,200
Then I suggest you

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,960
find another boyfriend.

531
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,599
I'll just follow your advice.

532
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,839
She suddenly changed her appearance

533
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,319
and faced me with a new style.

534
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,359
He probably just wanted

535
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,240
to attract my attention.

536
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,640
There are so many ways to change your image.

537
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,039
And he chose

538
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,279
and the weirdest one.

539
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,240
It's not strange.

540
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
It's not good to see a girl who is too thin.

541
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,440
It's okay for her to be like this.

542
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,720
Aesthetic problem?

543
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,440
Doesn't mean I will...

544
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,000
Have any feelings

545
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,480
that kind of girl.

546
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,920
Get to the point.

547
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,640
In order to

548
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,599
to attract my attention.

549
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,920
She started to break my rules.

550
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,359
She won't let go.

551
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,960
Then propose to you

552
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,119
and marry you in public.

553
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,000
She's too scheming.

554
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,240
Is not that cheap.

555
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,640
What she's using now

556
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,839
It should be psychological

557
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,839
drawbridge effect.

558
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,720
My brain mistook fright

559
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,200
as affection for a woman.

560
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,240
Your heart was beating so fast.

561
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,039
How could it be possible

562
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,319
see that I wasn't hooked?

563
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,279
She decided to

564
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,359
all her previous actions

565
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,359
transform and make the most of

566
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,480
develop their commercial value.

567
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
The comments

568
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
to arouse my desire for victory.

569
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,920
Led me to the scene,

570
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,559
then she...

571
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:15,880
And then?

572
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,440
What happened after the live stream?

573
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,200
Nothing.

574
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,359
Brother.

575
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
It's obvious.

576
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,319
Su Jin is really

577
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,640
has fallen in love with you.

578
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,400
She's doing everything

579
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,160
to attract your attention.

580
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,039
Whether it's to draw my attention

581
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,920
I'll find out the truth

582
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,880
to find out the truth.

583
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Why does it feel

584
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,920
my brother is acting weird today?

585
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,319
At this time,

586
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,559
your face is too sideways.

587
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
We have to pay attention

588
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
keep in relationship with the camera.

589
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,960
She's the best at 30 degrees.

590
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,759
Do you know

591
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:56,720
the netizens are

592
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,880
a brainiac.

593
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,119
The look in my eyes

594
00:19:59,119 --> 00:19:59,599
was clearly

595
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,359
to tell Mu Huron

596
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,599
brother, stop acting.

597
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,359
Why did it become

598
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,880
to a show of affection?

599
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,519
Are you really

600
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,799
attentively?

601
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,039
What I said just now

602
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,519
you'll need these

603
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,240
to work.

604
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,200
Although this live streaming

605
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,920
Is really good,

606
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,559
we can't become

607
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,640
we must not become arrogant.

608
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,839
OK, got it.

609
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,799
Next,

610
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
It's time for serious business.

611
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,759
What business?

612
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,000
Settle Mu Huron.

613
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
And continue to work with him.

614
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,400
Mr. Mu,

615
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,000
I wonder if you are busy.

616
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,680
Little Jin.

617
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,640
And wants to see you.

618
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,240
The sooner the better

619
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,519
you want to see me?

620
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,440
I'm there to renew our contract.

621
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,279
Business cooperation.

622
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,599
Why are you trying to

623
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,400
dressing me like this?

624
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,079
What the heck is that fuzzy?

625
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,839
Even if it's a private trip,

626
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,559
your current

627
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,640
with the public.

628
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,240
Everywhere

629
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,519
wherever you go.

630
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,920
Watch your manners.

631
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,480
This is not show business at all.

632
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
This is clearly

633
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,400
the Truman Show.

634
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,039
Miss Su,

635
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,759
I put this lipstick

636
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,920
In your bag.

637
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,599
Remember to eat

638
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,400
eat it.

639
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,400
Replenish your energy.

640
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,920
Eat more.

641
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,240
What are you talking about?

642
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
This...

643
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,319
What's this?

644
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,480
Give it to me.

645
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,519
Dress like this.

646
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,960
Why wouldn't I bring my boyfriend

647
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,160
to protect you.

648
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,720
Your boyfriend?

649
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll keep it carefully.

650
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,799
Miss Su, have a nice date.

651
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,519
Don't be impulsive!

652
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,359
Humph!

653
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,400
Do you think

654
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
only a hammer?

655
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,039
Miss Su.

656
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,319
Mr. Mu will be here soon.

657
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
He told me to take an order for you.

658
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,279
Alright.

659
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,319
What shall we order?

660
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,200
Australian lobster transported by air.

661
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,759
Give me the best

662
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,079
a dozen Iceland oysters.

663
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
Two Norwegian salmon.

664
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
King crab, deep-sea shrimp.

665
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,240
I think

666
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,119
you'll find a match.

667
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,880
Mr. Mu is rich.

668
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,559
Okay. One moment, please.

669
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,839
Mr. Mu is here.

670
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,680
To the point.

671
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,599
It was Mr. Mu

672
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,599
agreed to attend the appointment.

673
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
It's within the rules, right?

674
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,759
Compliance is the foundation.

675
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,039
But that doesn't mean it's valuable.

676
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,480
Tell me what you want.

677
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,200
Alright.

678
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,839
Then let's talk about

679
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,279
something valuable

680
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,480
look, our cooperation

681
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,279
for three years.

682
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,839
Has been going smoothly.

683
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,799
Is there still

684
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,880
one month is due.

685
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,119
You should consider

686
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,319
the continued collaboration?

687
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,039
Miss Su made such a big noise

688
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,880
made such a big noise before.

689
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,400
It's fine that I didn't hold her accountable.

690
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,240
You still want to carry on?

691
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,279
Are you kidding me?

692
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,440
I can talk with confidence

693
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,599
because I'm irreplaceable.

694
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,480
Tell me about it.

695
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,559
Your Mu's Group

696
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,359
all these years,

697
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,720
because of our cooperative relationship,

698
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,279
to our cooperation.

699
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,599
Especially this one.

700
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,960
Of your company.

701
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,359
How good

702
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,279
Is presented directly.

703
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:04,880
Mr. Mu, you read it.

704
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,359
More clearly than me.

705
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,079
Judging from your words,

706
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,039
I could

707
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:10,599
any of

708
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,160
any other celebrity

709
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,279
to cooperate with us.

710
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,480
Female stars are many,

711
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,720
but look at people from

712
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
your age and background,

713
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,079
you can't find anyone better than me.

714
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,000
I can also find

715
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,440
other outstanding women

716
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
to cooperate with me in dealing with my family.

717
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,079
Why should Miss Su tell me

718
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,920
you're the best fit.

719
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
You got to the point.

720
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,720
Our cooperation

721
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,000
Is only one month left.

722
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,720
At this moment,

723
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,640
you suddenly arrange to

724
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
the proposal.

725
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,079
There must be a reason

726
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,279
to do this.

727
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,279
For example,

728
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,079
to cope with the urging of your parents to get married.

729
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,079
If we stop

730
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,960
stop working with them,

731
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,720
mr. Mu will have to face

732
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,359
the troublesome scene

733
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,440
another troublesome scene.

734
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,559
You two.

735
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,519
Because your dad passed away early,

736
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,519
and bullied me.

737
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,720
Son,

738
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,559
you are the most devoted and filial child.

739
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,759
I only know

740
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,559
to threaten me?

741
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,720
Objective analysis of advantages and disadvantages

742
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,279
In summary,

743
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,599
and continue to cooperate.

744
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:02,839
It's good

745
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,680
and me.

746
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,680
Of course, this time

747
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,200
I offered to cooperate with you.

748
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,920
I will take the work

749
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,359
I will definitely take it seriously.

750
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,319
Miss Su. Miss

751
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,640
It must be three years

752
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,839
for three years.

753
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,359
But I feel that

754
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,960
It seems that

755
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
to know the real you.

756
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,160
She said

757
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,000
that's my work image.

758
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,519
What do you want?

759
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,519
I hope that we can make some adjustments

760
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,000
to the contract extension.

761
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,559
Except for the resources,

762
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,480
I want the company's shares.

763
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,720
The way of dividend should be discussed by both parties.

764
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,720
I have already worked out

765
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,359
the detailed rules.

766
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,119
Fang Jie will send it

767
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,920
secretary Gao to read it?

768
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,319
But you need money.

769
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,079
Right.

770
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,920
That's all.

771
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,079
As much money as I can.

772
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,079
It'll be easy as long as there's money.

773
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,039
As for the cooperation,

774
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
I've considered that.

775
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,519
So you have long prepared

776
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,440
a new agreement.

777
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,440
In which some new

778
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,319
to them.

779
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,119
In order not to waste this date,

780
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,160
have a look.

781
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,200
This guy is actually

782
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,119
come prepared

783
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,480
If he dares to add

784
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,759
strange terms,

785
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,599
don't blame me for touching the hammer.

786
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,759
The rules

787
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
about dating,

788
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,359
and the number of dates

789
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,279
why not?

790
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,880
We pretended to be a couple.

791
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,279
Things that waste

792
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,240
that wasted your time.

793
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,279
You should be happy.

794
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,079
As for the dividends

795
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,200
you've mentioned,

796
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
after I read

797
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,519
when I read the specific terms

798
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,200
will draw up

799
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,359
a new agreement for you.

800
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,400
Alright.

801
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Mr. Mu, that's very generous.

802
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,519
Since...

803
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,039
We're done here.

804
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,720
After we talk about it.

805
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,720
I'm starving.

806
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,599
Cook for me every day.

807
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,680
I haven't eaten meat for a long time.

808
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,000
By the way, Mr. Mu,

809
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:04,960
I recently changed

810
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,799
my contact information a while ago.

811
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,759
Let's friend each other on WeChat.

812
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,279
I'll add you as my friend.

813
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,000
Alright.

814
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Doctor Su.

815
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,400
That's only because

816
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,599
I love that.

817
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,759
As the saying goes,

818
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,599
an apple a day.

819
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
An apple a day.

820
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
The doctor stays away.

821
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,680
I like apples very much.

822
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,400
That's why I called Dr. Su.

823
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,000
Everyone should eat more apples.

824
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,039
You should eat one too.

825
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,000
You're welcome. Here.

826
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,519
Healthy.

827
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,400
Healthy.

828
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,319
Let's go then.

829
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,839
There are reporters outside.

830
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,319
Let me send you off.

831
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,599
Well, how long

832
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,920
how long will they follow us?

833
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
On a reality show,

834
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,559
miss Su Jin should be

835
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,759
should be more abundant than me.

836
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,319
It's not impossible.

837
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:24,759
Mr. Mu.

838
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
Pull over ahead.

839
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,599
Brother.

840
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,160
Is Su Jin

841
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,319
coming towards us?

842
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,000
How could it be?

843
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Since when does she

844
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
directly communicate with me?

845
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,559
Well, Ling Xiao, look.

846
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,039
She is coming.

847
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,000
Sister Su Jin.

848
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,200
What a coincidence.

849
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,920
What a coincidence.

850
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,519
You followed me.

851
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,400
This...

852
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,759
How is it possible?

853
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,839
Take it easy.

854
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,000
Today, I am here

855
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
to tell you

856
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,319
an exclusive.

857
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,680
My boyfriend and I will

858
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,240
will drive to a field.

859
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Let's see if we can take it.

860
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:21,839
To see

861
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,759
whether you can catch up with me.

862
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,640
What are you doing?

863
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,440
Mr. Mu, sit over there.

864
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
I'll drive the rest.

865
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,799
According to the file,

866
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,839
you don't know how to drive?

867
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,839
That's really character setting.

868
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,599
Mr. Mu, rest assured.

869
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,319
Leave it to me.

870
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,119
I'm a grown man.

871
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,599
I still need you.

872
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,240
Protect what?

873
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,960
Cut the crap.

874
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,200
What are you doing?

875
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,279
Hey.

876
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:50,599
Hey.

877
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,720
Get in the car.

878
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,680
Don't stand there.

879
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,920
Sit still.

880
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Brother, did we lose him?

881
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,440
Oh no. Where is this place?

882
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,799
All right

883
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
we've lost them.

884
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
You can drive on.

885
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,880
Alright.

886
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,759
I told you many times

887
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,000
I hate accidents the most

888
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,640
the most.

889
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,720
Wow.

890
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,640
Mr. Mu, come and take a look.

891
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
It's so beautiful.

892
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,599
Meteorite.

893
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,759
Most people call it a meteor.

894
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,279
I know.

895
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,839
But I like them

896
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,799
not because they...

897
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,400
About the wish wish.

898
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,079
But the meteorite.

899
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,400
Once it falls to the ground,

900
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,680
It will bring

901
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,240
to the Earth.

902
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,400
What do you mean?

903
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,319
Do you know what a meteorite is?

904
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,519
It's like glass.

905
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,039
There are blue and green.

906
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,000
How does she know these?

907
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,440
It's the one

908
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,359
the hot temperature of the meteorite

909
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,920
the hot temperature of the meteorite

910
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,079
melted the target on the ground

911
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,519
and then cooled and solidified to form

912
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,480
he even studied geology

913
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,960
he even studied geology.

914
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,880
Fang Xie,

915
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,640
gave me

916
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,319
about geology.

917
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,200
In the play,

918
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,480
say yes and mean no

919
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,599
stop acting.

920
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,759
Luckily, I'm smart enough

921
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,759
I almost got caught.

922
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,759
Are you referring to

923
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,720
was first found in the Modawi River

924
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,079
In the Czech Republic.

925
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,839
So it is also called

926
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,640
the Modawi Stone.

927
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:56,920
Because each one

928
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,039
of each one

929
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,440
that's why they have

930
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,079
are different.

931
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,480
But no one knows.

932
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,720
What kind of meteorite

933
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,079
the next meteorite will bring?

934
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,680
Well

935
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,200
they are

936
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,680
that's unique to us.

937
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,519
There's no rush anyway.

938
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,680
We'll watch the stars before going back.

939
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I knew you had ulterior motives.

940
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,079
It's really too cold.

941
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,160
Get in the car.

942
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,079
Brother,

943
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,159
let's have a good meal tonight...

944
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,400
Find our way back?

945
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,400
Shut up.

946
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,280
Shut up.

947
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:31,760
Where's my hammer?

948
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,920
Here it is.

949
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,079
There are no paparazzi now.

950
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,360
I won't walk you upstairs.

951
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,519
Mr. Mu.

952
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
The draft

953
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,039
our new contract.

954
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,119
Next time, can we

955
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,800
at home?

956
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
At home

957
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,639
more private.

958
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,320
In case you tell me

959
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,840
no need.

960
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,800
I think our cooperation

961
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,599
to continue.

962
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,440
What?

963
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,639
I don't usually say it the second time.

964
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,840
But considering your feeling now,

965
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
this is the last time.

966
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,679
Our cooperation is over.

967
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,239
Gao Ling will ask you

968
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,199
gao Ling will ask to see you.

969
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,360
It's one month and three days left.

970
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Next,

971
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,440
I need Miss Su's cooperation.

972
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,719
Merry meet, merry part

973
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,480
In that case,

974
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,920
what else do I have

975
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:11,880
that need your cooperation.

976
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,199
For example, you rejected a proposal

977
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,119
and then counter-proposed.

978
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,239
The consequence that

979
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,199
caused by

980
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,639
I hope you and your team

981
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,119
to give me

982
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,280
the perfect solution.

983
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,519
Otherwise,

984
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,079
what compensation?

985
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,440
You should have known that

986
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:25,599
also,

987
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,840
I hope that

988
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,880
Is a person who believes

989
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,519
that doesn't affect

990
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,480
our company.

991
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,159
To this problem.

992
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,320
The atmosphere is always good.

993
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,079
Where is the problem?

994
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,159
Congratulations to Miss Su.

995
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,199
Congratulations to Miss Su.

996
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,199
To show

997
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,320
the highest-level celebration.

998
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,559
Tell me what you want to eat tomorrow.

999
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,320
I'll go and buy it for you.

1000
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,159
He refused.

1001
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,400
Seriously?

1002
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
I can't be more serious.

1003
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:01,960
Come on.

1004
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,679
Why not?

1005
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,679
Didn't you just say that...

1006
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,159
The atmosphere is good.

1007
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:04,840
We can win her.

1008
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,719
To get a raise?

1009
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,559
I don't know.

1010
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,480
Working in such an atmosphere

1011
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,639
are problems.

1012
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,360
Miss Su,

1013
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,360
tell us the truth.

1014
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,400
If something happened

1015
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,039
Is there any reason

1016
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,719
that we don't know?

1017
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,480
It's personal.

1018
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,239
I don't understand

1019
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,239
why you can't renew your contract.

1020
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,239
First,

1021
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,400
she repeatedly violates our agreement.

1022
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,280
Second,

1023
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,039
the matter of opposing the proposal

1024
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,079
caused a series of

1025
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,960
a series of troubles.

1026
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,199
The third and most important part is

1027
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,840
work is work.

1028
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,159
There's no emotion whatsoever.

1029
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,280
Otherwise, it will become

1030
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,079
uncontrollable variables.

1031
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
I never work with

1032
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,719
with a woman who likes me.

1033
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,159
Why are you sighing?

1034
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:44,800
You don't agree with me?

1035
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,920
I agree with you.

1036
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,960
Right. See?

1037
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,960
That's a great partner.

1038
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,360
But it's just gone.

1039
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,840
What to tell mom?

1040
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,960
To her?

1041
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,320
How to answer my questions?

1042
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,599
In your relationship?

1043
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,440
Please tell me.

1044
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,320
What to do.

1045
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:06,960
What to do?

1046
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,039
Cold scrambled egg.

1047
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,400
I'm about to start now.

1048
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,280
Right away.

1049
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,239
What should we do now?

1050
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,519
About...

1051
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
To renew it.

1052
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,199
But I want Murhurun to continue.

1053
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,360
He begged me to renew it.

1054
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,119
Let me hear

1055
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,519
what is the plan of the perfect student?

1056
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
Since I was little,

1057
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,960
I have never dropped the ball

1058
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,440
at all times.

1059
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,280
Do you know the last person

1060
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
who doesn't want to work with me

1061
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,760
the consequence?

1062
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,119
Of your

1063
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,199
of your geological hammer.

1064
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,960
And suffer more.

1065
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,280
Than to die.

1066
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,519
She's five years senior to me,

1067
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,920
and he hasn't graduated yet.

1068
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,559
Everyone is here.

1069
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,400
Then let's

1070
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,800
and get straight to the point.

1071
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,320
Next season,

1072
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
our top priority

1073
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,079
to promote

1074
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,079
the largest

1075
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,960
the largest porphyry Copper Mine in the country.

1076
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,840
The M & A of Qiduo Copper Mine

1077
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,199
If the acquisition is successful,

1078
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,000
this will mean

1079
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,920
mu's Group will

1080
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,320
will take an absolute lead

1081
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,400
In the mining industry.

1082
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,440
At that time,

1083
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
the other business of the group

1084
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,679
must make way for the acquisition.

1085
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,400
I think other than M & A,

1086
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,360
we have to maintain

1087
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,320
our existing business domain,

1088
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,039
we can also

1089
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,159
to the new energy field.

1090
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,199
The civilian market

1091
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
high-nickel batteries

1092
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,760
Is the limelight

1093
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,719
the coolest new energy source.

1094
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Is like the fuel car.

1095
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,599
The electric vehicle can't live without fuel.

1096
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,840
Electric vehicles need electricity.

1097
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,199
The amount of Ni in the battery

1098
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,400
determines the capacity of the battery.

1099
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,199
Mr. Mu,

1100
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,360
for the storage battery area.

1101
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,480
Don't welcome

1102
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,679
the involvement of private capital.

1103
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,800
We can take a step forward

1104
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
before we can do it.

1105
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,119
To produce intermediate nickel products,

1106
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,000
which are electrolytic nickel and nickel sulfate.

1107
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,400
Huron?

1108
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,119
To launch a new business.

1109
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,880
Is not as simple

1110
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,480
as you think.

1111
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,559
First of all,

1112
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,480
It needs to introduce new equipment and talents.

1113
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,559
Second,

1114
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,159
the company's existing businesses

1115
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,159
needs to be adjusted and restructured.

1116
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,840
Third,

1117
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,519
just as Mr. Ma said just now,

1118
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,119
the problem of nickel ore resources

1119
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,199
Is full of high risks.

1120
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,000
But high risks

1121
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,280
represents a high return.

1122
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,920
Over ten years ago,

1123
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,719
state E was trying to revive its industry

1124
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,760
the export of laterite

1125
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,039
of laterite nickel ore.

1126
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,320
In recent years,

1127
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,599
the window was reopened.

1128
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,079
To allow some companies

1129
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,000
to invest in E State.

1130
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
With very strict conditions.

1131
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
And recently,

1132
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,920
I have taken down a few mines

1133
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,239
and bought a few factories.

1134
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,320
I object.

1135
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,840
If the company advances rashly,

1136
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,039
we may lose the territory we once had.

1137
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,119
That's too risky.

1138
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,280
I also disagree.

1139
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,280
The development of the company

1140
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
to develop

1141
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,559
to get where you are today.

1142
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:53,920
Enough.

1143
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,519
Everyone's attitude

1144
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,599
Is clear.

1145
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,159
As for Mr. Mu,

1146
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,480
he's still young.

1147
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:00,639
They still need

1148
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,519
to know more about the company.

1149
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,199
When it comes to new business,

1150
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,519
let's not rush to

1151
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,719
to make a conclusion now.

1152
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,679
We need to wait

1153
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
the detailed report

1154
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,719
of Mr. Xiao Mu's team.

1155
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,440
I have

1156
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,599
I have a dinner to attend.

1157
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,679
To have a dinner together.

1158
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,480
Together.

1159
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,719
Huron.

1160
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,360
Come to my office

1161
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,199
come to my office and talk privately.

1162
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:18,679
Alright.

1163
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,119
These old fogies

1164
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,480
and only do things conservatively.

1165
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,760
New-type enterprises

1166
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,440
Is developing so quickly.

1167
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,440
The project is already

1168
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,360
this project.

1169
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,400
It's just a technical method

1170
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,599
can't be solved.

1171
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,159
We've prepared

1172
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,639
the food is ready.

1173
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,719
The food is on their lips.

1174
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,119
They didn't know.

1175
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:36,719
Open your mouth.

1176
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,920
A new project

1177
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,719
In the new project.

1178
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,719
Since the parent company won't allow it,

1179
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,119
we should invest in

1180
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,039
to start new companies.

1181
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,599
Right.

1182
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,559
Don't be envious of us

1183
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,760
jealous of our making money.

1184
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,440
Now,

1185
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,679
you should make more choices

1186
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,079
that are suitable to invest in

1187
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,239
to invest in and acquire.

1188
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,320
Alright.

1189
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,119
Got it.

1190
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,920
I have something else to do.

1191
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,079
Recently, the company's directors

1192
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:58,920
are not satisfied with you.

1193
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,880
Seeing Second Uncle's look.

1194
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,679
Going on like this

1195
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,480
to keep going like this.

1196
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,199
No rush.

1197
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,360
One day,

1198
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,320
I will prove my ability to everyone

1199
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,440
with the results.

1200
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,559
Is it that message of Xiaojin?

1201
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,440
Call her back at once.

1202
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,599
She wants to rest.

1203
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,519
Let her rest.

1204
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
I know her.

1205
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,199
After she adjusts herself,

1206
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,400
she'll come back.

1207
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,440
That's right.

1208
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,760
You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink

1209
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,400
those who force to stay can't stay long.

1210
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,079
Come on.

1211
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,079
This is it?

1212
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:52,960
The information

1213
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
since his childhood.

1214
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,320
From his upbringing

1215
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,000
to hobbies,

1216
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,000
to company information,

1217
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,679
It's all here.

1218
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,559
Great.

1219
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
If there's anything you don't know,

1220
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,480
and I

1221
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,599
the dictionary?

1222
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:02,679
The words won't be found.

1223
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,800
Welcome to me.

1224
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,639
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you

1225
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,480
what made the opportunity

1226
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,159
that prompted

1227
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,440
the collaboration between Jinqing and Mu Hurun

1228
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
It was his sister Mu Xiaoman

1229
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,480
was actually his sister, Mu Xiaoman.

1230
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,480
Where's Mu Huron?

1231
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,880
Her company is getting better.

1232
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,719
She needs a companion

1233
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,760
to various occasions.

1234
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,960
That's why I found Jin Qing

1235
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,400
when I arrived at her house,

1236
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,320
I realized that

1237
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,199
the reason was partly

1238
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,280
he wants to promote

1239
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,920
his popularity.

1240
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,920
The other half

1241
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,079
was Mr. Mu's mother.

1242
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,880
Forced him to find a girlfriend.

1243
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,800
All these years,

1244
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,360
mu's Group

1245
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,960
aside from its

1246
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,079
Its own established businesses,

1247
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,079
It has also invested

1248
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,199
many other industries,

1249
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,840
like the entertainment industry,

1250
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,039
the internet industry,

1251
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,920
because of Su Jin,

1252
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,679
brought more people

1253
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,039
know about Mu's Group.

1254
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:52,920
It is also more convenient for me to do so.

1255
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,320
To break into the young market.

1256
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,719
The more outstanding your sister is,

1257
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,000
the greater the benefits

1258
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,079
to Mu's Group.

1259
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,760
So for coal bosses

1260
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,840
to him,

1261
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
presenting the data is the most intuitive.
