1
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,719
Miss Ningxia.

2
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,760
Call me Ningxia.

3
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
You're more beautiful than I thought.

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,560
You're lovely too.

5
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,519
What brings you here?

6
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,240
Because I want to see you.

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
You bought a new car?

8
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,360
Try it.

9
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,960
Open the door!

10
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,759
This one.

11
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,560
Will take you for a ride.

12
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,639
Do you remember the last time

13
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,599
we rode together?

14
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
The date with Secretary Gao.

15
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,000
But the weather that day

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,159
was better than today.

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,319
Hold on tight. I'm going to speed up.

18
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,960
Mu Huron, slow down.

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,719
Look at yourself.

20
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,439
You almost made me fall again.

21
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,199
What's wrong?

22
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,120
Why are you so angry?

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,120
Fine, I'm sorry.

24
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,639
My father is really upset

25
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,479
you taught him that, right?

26
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,960
I haven't punished you for that.

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
How dare you trick me!

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Sorry, sorry.

29
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,000
I apologize first.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Alright?

31
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,240
Like this.

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,840
I'll buy you a candy.

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

34
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,840
You're only three in my heart.

35
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,840
And you're a lollipop.

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,919
This is for yourself!

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
I don't want that.

38
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,360
Childish.

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,840
This one

40
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,319
Is same as

41
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,720
as your previous one.

42
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,399
Where did you get this?

43
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,399
I looked it up online.

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,480
There is one in Bincheng,

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,360
so I bought it?

46
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,560
Doraemon?

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,759
Where is Doraemon?

48
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,959
I just hope this stone

49
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,920
can ease your sorrow.

50
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,040
I also know

51
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,720
actually

52
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,160
the only thing

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,800
just because of the stone.

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,480
Right?

55
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,439
You think

56
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,680
I don't even know

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
even the most basic hobby of yours.

58
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,959
He's always

59
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,480
hasn't he always been that way?

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't have any expectation

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
for him.

62
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,160
At least he's made the first step

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,920
that he took the first step towards you.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
He got closer to you.

65
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,360
Maybe you should

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,000
shouldn't you follow his example

67
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,519
and make some advances to him?

68
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,800
I know.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,079
At this moment,

70
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,040
you two

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
for you two to get along

72
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,560
to get along in this way.

73
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,439
It's fine.

74
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,319
Take your time. Don't worry.

75
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,879
I accept your gift.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,920
Let's forget about it.

77
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,720
Come on.

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
Didn't you say you wanted to take me for a ride?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,839
Please get on the carriage.

81
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,639
Sorry.

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,759
I read your story

83
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
on the internet.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
But I was curious.

85
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,319
Why you two broke up.

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,319
Of course, it's fine

87
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,399
If you don't want to.

88
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,720
I have nothing to say.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,279
Our relationship

90
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,160
eight years ago.

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,839
We are still young.

92
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,120
We have the same

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
hobby

94
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,120
Is sweet

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Is sweet.

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,199
What's wrong with your hand?

97
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,800
Nothing.

98
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Are you injured?

99
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,079
So you won't feel cold.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Let me watch it with you.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
You see this?

102
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
I think

103
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,160
yes. This is all too wonderful.

104
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,720
And even the God.

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,439
This makes me

106
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,600
In my life

107
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,879
and the hardest hit,

108
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,439
so,

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,120
that's when you got sick.

110
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,480
I was diagnosed with lupus.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
I know Gao Ling.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
If he finds out about this,

113
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,000
he won't let go.

114
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,120
But the more so,

115
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,319
the more sure I am that

116
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,199
that I couldn't be a burden to him.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
So I lied to him.

118
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,399
I accused him of being poor.

119
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,639
I blamed him for having nothing.

120
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,959
I always find fault with him.

121
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,879
In the end,

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
we finally succeeded

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,480
we ended in discord.

124
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,079
But what you did

125
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,959
didn't make him forget you.

126
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,519
Instead, you became the knot

127
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,040
In his heart.

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,360
All these years,

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,519
he never had another

130
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,759
In a serious relationship.

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
No one was truly

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,839
with all our heart.

133
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
Actually, I've seen you before.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
And all your posts.

135
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,519
And you still love him.

136
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,279
In that case,

137
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,079
why didn't you choose

138
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,600
to make it clear?

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,240
He loves you so much.

140
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,279
At least you should give him

141
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,839
the right to choose.

142
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,480
Xiaoman.

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,959
Don't you love Gao Ling?

144
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,480
Why did you tell me this?

145
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,240
Just because I love him,

146
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,199
so I wanted him to know

147
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
Instead of being kept in the dark

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,319
and ended a relationship...

149
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,120
With no reason.

150
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,960
That's not fair to Gao Ling.

151
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,360
Aren't you afraid that...

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,519
That he'll choose me again

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,159
he chose me again.

154
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,000
He turned off his phone and went to work.

155
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,919
Is he really sick?

156
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,240
I can't.

157
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,840
I need to check what happened.

158
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,799
I need to talk to you.

159
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,799
-You first. -You first.

160
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,919
You first.

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,440
Xiaoman.

162
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,559
I found that I seem to fall in love with you.

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,039
This may come out of the blue.

164
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,320
In the past,

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,480
I treated you like my sister.

166
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,200
You are

167
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,720
that little girl

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,799
who never grows up.

169
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,600
But I don't know

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
when I couldn't

171
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,799
I could never

172
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,039
treat you as I used to.

173
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,919
I need to face my heart.

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,679
Mu Xiaoman,

175
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,159
you can't play sick.

176
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,279
Just disappear.

177
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,600
I won't buy it.

178
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,320
I won't leave you alone.

179
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,039
But I'm not sick.

180
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,279
I know everything.

181
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,919
Stop acting.

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,799
It's not you?

183
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,240
What did you know?

184
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,759
Don't you know

185
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,919
they told me everything.

186
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,799
I'm willing to accompany you for the treatment.

187
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,840
Me too.

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,759
I'm not the one who gets lupus.

189
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,519
It's Ningxia.

190
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,320
Ningxia?

191
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,559
That's right.

192
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,919
First girlfriend, Ningxia.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,879
What's going on?

194
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,639
This is what happened.

195
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,879
I used to like a blogger.

196
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,120
And the stories she wrote.

197
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,840
Then

198
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,759
I found out

199
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,120
she is your ex-girlfriend.

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
After I broke up with you,

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
she's been receiving treatment all the time.

202
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,840
I went to see her.

203
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,960
That's why

204
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
she left me

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,559
because of illness.

206
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,960
She has never despised you.

207
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,639
And she never

208
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,159
hurt you on purpose.

209
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,159
Those things you once thought...

210
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
Are non-existent.

211
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,799
No matter who you're with in the future,

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,399
you won't have to take the past

213
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,360
take sth. to heart

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,519
gao Ling, you should spare yourself.

215
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,919
Which hospital is she in?

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Oh, my poor memory.

217
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,919
I'll send you the address.

218
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,600
Xiaoman.

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you for telling me.

220
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,480
Sorry.

221
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,559
Don't say sorry to me.

222
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,519
I know you misunderstood that

223
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,799
misunderstood that I was ill,

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
on purpose.

225
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,039
You don't have to apologize.

226
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,840
Okay, I've sent you the address.

227
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,679
Go to the hospital to see her.

228
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,919
My mom is waiting for me to have lunch.

229
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll go in now.

230
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,600
Mom, I'm back.

231
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Isn't that Secretary Gao's car?

232
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,360
Why don't you come in and sit for a while?

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Something urgent must happen to him.

234
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,039
Mom, what are we going to eat tonight?

235
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm so hungry.

236
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,159
All you know is to eat.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Who wants to lose weight?

238
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:07,960
Oh, right.

239
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,600
My mom knew Uncle was here,

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
she asked him to meet her at home.

241
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,639
What do you think?

242
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,120
I will think about it.

243
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,120
Alright.

244
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,440
You're the boss.

245
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,000
Is this the right way to cook chicken soup?

246
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,679
But you're doing this now.

247
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,080
What do you think we should do?

248
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
What about

249
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,279
you cook a meal for her.

250
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,200
No, she can't.

251
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,879
She will dislike it.

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,159
I almost ruined the kitchen

253
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,360
I almost destroyed the kitchen.

254
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,399
Only she didn't kick me out.

255
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,799
Uncle, here is the thing.

256
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,120
Actually, I once

257
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,279
ji Shi mentioned that

258
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,519
she never ate your cooking

259
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,039
she has never eaten the food you cooked.

260
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,960
I think

261
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,159
she might be looking forward to it.

262
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,960
How about

263
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
please try again.

264
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,440
Really?

265
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm sure she'll be happy.

266
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
Why is it so sour?

267
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,320
Look at my eyes.

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,840
You mistook vinegar for rice wine.

269
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
You ruined this chicken in vain.

270
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
You are back

271
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,000
what are you doing in the kitchen again?

272
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Nothing.

273
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,879
I just ordered takeout,

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
I wanted to get some plates

275
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,120
and replate them.

276
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Are you hungry?

277
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,320
Food will be ready soon.

278
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,240
Hold on a second.

279
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,320
Almost done

280
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,039
no rush.

281
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,120
OK.

282
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,840
But at least,

283
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,039
he's made the first step.

284
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,320
He got closer to you.

285
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Maybe you should

286
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,120
shouldn't you follow his example

287
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,480
and make some advances to him?

288
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,879
Oh, I forgot it.

289
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,919
I'll call the flower shop

290
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,399
call the flower shop below

291
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,559
and ask them to move them away.

292
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,240
No need.

293
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,080
My home is empty already.

294
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,480
It's good to put it here.

295
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,080
Really?

296
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah, I think it's good.

297
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,679
Hour.

298
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
Where are you working tomorrow?

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,240
Are you in the city?

300
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,200
Where?

301
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,879
What's up

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,840
nothing, I just ask.

303
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,759
I can just ask.

304
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
We have a variety show at Binhai Theater.

305
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
The show is drawing to an end.

306
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
We have the last part

307
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,879
of the game.

308
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,960
See you later.

309
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,000
Cut. Rest.

310
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Circle around. Circle.

311
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
Circle it! Circle!

312
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,639
You've behaved well today.

313
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,519
I have some water.

314
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,279
Give it to me.

315
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,080
Get out of my way.

316
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,840
That's --

317
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,879
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,360
Why did you take my camera?

319
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
Not only do I want your camera,

320
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm also going to

321
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,480
even the camera is fixed.

322
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,879
Miss Su,

323
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,279
look, isn't that uncle?

324
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:48,440
You

325
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,919
that's enough.

326
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,120
Mr. Su, it's you.

327
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,399
You know each other?

328
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,000
Return the camera to her.

329
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,080
I won't give it to him.

330
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,000
You haven't caused a fuss at home.

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,919
Now you're making a scene here,

332
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,279
su Jianguo, what are you doing?

333
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,599
It's him.

334
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,359
That's enough.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,480
Everyone, the show is about to begin.

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,519
You return it to me.

337
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,759
Give it back to me!

338
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,799
Fang Xie,

339
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,279
bring him back.

340
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

341
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,200
Uncle, are you hurt?

342
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,400
Xiao Xia,

343
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,319
ask Fang Jie to take my dad

344
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,799
to the hospital for a body check-up.

345
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,960
If there's anything else,

346
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,839
let me know right away.

347
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,720
Alright.

348
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,079
Uncle,

349
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,200
please don't blame Little Su.

350
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,839
This studio is a work place.

351
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,200
No wonder she is so angry.

352
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,279
This...

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,799
Uncle.

354
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,160
Shall we take you

355
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
to the hospital?

356
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,440
No need.

357
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,200
I won't bother you.

358
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,039
Go back to your work.

359
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,240
That uncle must be

360
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,519
of Mr. Su, right?

361
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,440
Really?

362
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,400
I don't actually blame him.

363
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,839
The photographer just now

364
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,119
keeps following the actresses

365
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,119
being sneaky.

366
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,920
He squatted down to take photos.

367
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,519
I don't know what he took.

368
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,440
Right?

369
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,519
Stop. Stop.

370
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,480
What's wrong again?

371
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,119
Miss Su.

372
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,960
Xia, call the police.

373
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,359
You

374
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,599
contact the on-site producer.

375
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,160
Dad, I feel so sick.

376
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,240
Hang in there, child.

377
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,559
We will reach the hospital in a while.

378
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,039
Are you alright, child?

379
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,599
You smashed into such a big car.

380
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
Do you have eyes?

381
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm a grown-up. Why did you bump into her?

382
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,599
Are you blind?

383
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,759
It's fine that you hit me,

384
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,799
you hurt the baby?

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Father.

386
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,039
Father.

387
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,400
I was little

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,640
dad, is it because

389
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,960
cause you trouble again?

390
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,960
I misunderstood.

391
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
It was all my fault.

392
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,400
That's good to know.

393
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,920
You haven't said it.

394
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,119
Why did you come to me on the studio?

395
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,680
At first, I wanted to

396
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,519
to give you chicken soup to nourish you.

397
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,039
I didn't expect that

398
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,400
also,

399
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,279
during this period,

400
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,519
dad has brought you a lot of trouble.

401
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
So I made up my mind.

402
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,759
I've bought it.

403
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,240
The train ticket for tonight

404
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,519
I'll go back to my hometown in Jiaxing.

405
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,359
Your grandpa has been

406
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,920
wants me to go back and keep him company.

407
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,839
The director wants to see you.

408
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,640
It's time to record.

409
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, I'll be right there.

410
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,319
Alright.

411
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,759
Then go quickly.

412
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,839
I don't want to delay work.

413
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:24,279
Dad.

414
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,559
That's

415
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,880
huron's mother

416
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,680
Is inviting you to her house for a gathering

417
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,799
why don't you stay a few more days?

418
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,799
Really?

419
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,359
That's great.

420
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll stay a few more days.

421
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
Hurry up.

422
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,160
Sorry

423
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
xiaoqi, that's right.

424
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,319
They are clean.

425
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,599
The same color?

426
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,799
Isn't he the in-law?

427
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,599
You're really on a roll

428
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,079
you won all afternoon.

429
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,960
It's not a big deal.

430
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,960
That year

431
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,480
back then,

432
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,960
kill all directions?

433
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,400
Then?

434
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,920
After that,

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
then we stopped playing.

436
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,680
I won't play anymore.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,279
Now my hand is in labor.

438
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
All of them were just giving in to me.

439
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,759
I'll give in to you.

440
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,720
You only beat me?

441
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,759
Xiaoman, it's your turn to draw.

442
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,279
Do you want to go up?

443
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,160
To play with me?

444
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,720
I don't want to play anymore.

445
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,519
I'll look after you.

446
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,039
Lun,

447
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,519
you two

448
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,759
don't just focus on falling in love.

449
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Xiaoman isn't likely to

450
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,759
gao Ling is not here.

451
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,200
If you don't play well,

452
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
the three of us

453
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,119
will be destroyed this afternoon.

454
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,240
That's impossible.

455
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,519
Brother.

456
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,960
Did Gao Ling say when

457
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,319
when he'd be back?

458
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,079
Not really.

459
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,440
Gao Ling asked for leave.

460
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,839
For several days.

461
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
This guy hates salary deduction.

462
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,079
For the whole year,

463
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,240
he can't take a leave.

464
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,079
What's the matter?

465
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,200
For several days.

466
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
They are young people.

467
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,599
She must be dating.

468
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,839
That's possible.

469
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,079
He's with me.

470
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,240
I fired two guns at once

471
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
I didn't see that.

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
What's your card?

473
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,240
What happened to you?

474
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,720
Did you not sleep well last night?

475
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,720
Sister-in-law, I'm fine.

476
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,079
How about you play for me?

477
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,279
I'm going to the bathroom.

478
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,119
What's wrong? You seem absent-minded.

479
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,839
Come on, Xiao Jin.

480
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,519
You hit the same.

481
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:37,839
Come on.

482
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,079
Alright.

483
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,440
Come on.

484
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,319
This is for you.

485
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,079
What do you mean?

486
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,319
I'm here to tell you

487
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,680
that what I said last time

488
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,359
was not because of misunderstanding

489
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,279
or sympathy.

490
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,079
I mean every word

491
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,119
every word I say.

492
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,839
But you and Ningxia

493
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,759
we've already discussed this.

494
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,559
Sorry.

495
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,359
If it wasn't for Xiaoman,

496
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,359
I still don't know

497
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,000
suffered all these years.

498
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,160
I should be the one who apologize.

499
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,720
Xiaoman is right.

500
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,480
I shouldn't have kept it from you these years.

501
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,119
Because of me.

502
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
But after I met Xiaoman,

503
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,079
I was quite relieved.

504
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,480
At least you have

505
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
there's a good girl like her

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,119
like her.

507
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,559
What about you?

508
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
How's the situation now?

509
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,880
Although I'm

510
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,119
In the hospital now.

511
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,799
Her situation is actually very optimistic.

512
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,200
I can be discharged in a few days.

513
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,920
As long as you take medicine on time after that,

514
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,319
he was no different from normal people.

515
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,039
You lied to me again?

516
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,720
I really didn't cheat you this time.

517
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,640
You can go and ask

518
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,759
If you don't believe me.

519
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,880
Sure, I'll ask him about it.

520
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,119
Gao Ling,

521
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,680
can we still be friends in the future?

522
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,079
Certainly.

523
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,160
If you need anything in the future,

524
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,160
let me know.

525
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,839
I only hope

526
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,200
that you won't hold back

527
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
because of my immaturity back then

528
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,599
because of my immaturity.

529
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,160
Xiaoman is a good girl.

530
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,279
You have to cherish her.

531
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,359
That's how it is.

532
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,839
I have forgotten what you said

533
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,960
what you said last time.

534
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,319
Say it one more time.

535
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,200
Xiaoman.

536
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
I really like you.

537
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,559
Be my girlfriend.

538
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,759
Xiaoman.

539
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,279
Xiaoman.

540
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,759
Xiaoman.

541
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,039
Huron?

542
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,240
Where, where are you going?

543
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,680
I just saw something

544
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
something is wrong.

545
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,559
I'll check on her.

546
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
She wasn't acting strange.

547
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,079
Don't bother her.

548
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,720
I know my sister the best.

549
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,079
I've acted so strangely recently.

550
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
If you leave, we only need one more player.

551
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,799
Your mother-in-law.

552
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,079
For more trouble these days.

553
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,160
Don't be shy.

554
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,160
The 6 p.m. train should leave.

555
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Uncle Su, stay here for a few more days.

556
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,319
To keep my sister-in-law company.

557
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,720
Little Jin is busy with work.

558
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,279
I can't help her here.

559
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,400
She's your mother-in-law.

560
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,400
Please take good care

561
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,519
please take care of her.

562
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,359
Don't worry. I'll be your daughter.

563
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll go get the car.

564
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,839
No need.

565
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,640
I've called a taxi.

566
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
The taxi has arrived.

567
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
Please stay.

568
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,839
Alright.

569
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,079
Take care. I'm leaving.

570
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,799
I'll load the car for you.

571
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,960
Alright.

572
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:10,680
Goodbye then.

573
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,480
Yes, yes, Mr. In-laws.

574
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,319
Take care.

575
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,880
Okay. Bye.

576
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,000
Uncle Su, take care.

577
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,160
- Goodbye. - Bye.

578
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you were leaving?

579
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,440
Aren't there many plans to stay for a few days?

580
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,880
He bought the tickets yesterday.

581
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,559
I was not

582
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I wasn't a decent father.

583
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,960
I can't help you much.

584
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,559
Now that you're working for Jin Qing,

585
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
you're working for Qin Qing.

586
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,440
It's not an easy feat.

587
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,680
I was worried that I would

588
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,279
If any stupid idea

589
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,000
pop up again

590
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,440
and cause you trouble again.

591
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,200
I was worried

592
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,519
that your rich mother-in-law

593
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,559
and doesn't get along with her sister-in-law.

594
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,200
So I came here

595
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,240
and meet them

596
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,799
and support you.

597
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,640
Now I'm at ease.

598
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,400
Huron.

599
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,039
Come over and talk to me.

600
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,039
Huron.

601
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,599
I leave my daughter to you.

602
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,039
Rest assured, Uncle.

603
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,079
Daughter, take care.

604
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,599
Go back to your hometown if you miss me.

605
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,680
Huron.

606
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,480
If you want me to know

607
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,880
you've treated her badly,

608
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,359
I will be back

609
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,039
as soon as possible.

610
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,920
Got it.

611
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,319
Alright, I'm leaving.

612
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,920
Remember to send a message when you get home.

613
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,359
Come back. Go back.

614
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
Why are you upset?

615
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,920
Like this.

616
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,839
In the future,

617
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,240
If you want to,

618
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,920
I can go with you anytime.

619
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,559
Alright?

620
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,599
I'm not upset.

621
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,240
Have one's own way of doing things

622
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
come and go as you please.

623
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,880
And never thinks about others.

624
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,200
I won't worry if I leave.

625
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
So stubborn.

626
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Alright, don't be sad.

627
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's go home too, okay?

628
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,160
Come on.

629
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,599
When did you move the luggage in?

630
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,599
I've prepared a backup key.

631
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,799
You're going to officially move in?

632
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,480
Why isn't the owner happy about it?

633
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,880
Or are you afraid that when my dad leaves,

634
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,799
and I'll be too lonely.

635
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,880
Wrong. I was afraid I'd be too lonely.

636
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,000
That's why

637
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,319
I want you to spend more time with me.

638
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,119
Change your shoes.

639
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,559
See what else you have in your bag.

640
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
That's you?

641
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,759
That's you.

642
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,279
This is not me.

643
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,519
What are these red circles?

644
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,519
That's right.

645
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,400
What are these red circles?

646
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,079
It's not your birthday,

647
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,400
It's not mine, either.

648
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
That's right.

649
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,440
What is not yours is also not mine.

650
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,480
Could it be...

651
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,079
It's our 100th day anniversary

652
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,960
since we met each other.

653
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,559
You don't know, right?

654
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,559
Stop acting.

655
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,240
Is your acting that bad?

656
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
100 days?

657
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,200
100 days are not an anniversary.

658
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
How come 100 days are not?

659
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I think these 100 days

660
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
Is very important to us.

661
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:00,720
Mu Huron.

662
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,599
Thank you for everything.

663
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,720
You have no schedule today.

664
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,920
Have a good rest at home.

665
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,759
Su Jin has no announcements.

666
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,440
But Su Jishi is busy.

667
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,720
My tutor sent an email yesterday.

668
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,559
I have to focus on

669
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,599
my study.

670
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,759
Doctor Su, you may be busy with your work.

671
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,839
I have to go to a meeting now.

672
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,400
See you later.

673
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,200
That cold?

674
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,880
I'll be back after work.

675
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,319
New mineral research report of Yiliangshan.

676
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,039
Hello, Little Su.

677
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,759
Hello, Miss Mo.

678
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,440
You are saying that

679
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,200
the mineral content detected

680
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
In the ore sample of Yiliang Mountain

681
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,519
Is very likely to be new mineral.

682
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,640
We conducted

683
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,160
the mineral samples

684
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,240
and powder crystal.

685
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,319
Physical properties evaluation,

686
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,640
chemical composition determination

687
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,440
the crystal structure test

688
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,160
that it belongs to a new mineral

689
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,759
Is very high.

690
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,079
If it's really a new Mineral,

691
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:46,839
It will be a very

692
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,799
meaningful discovery.

693
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,079
That's right.

694
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,960
But I already have

695
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
was acquired by another enterprise

696
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,559
was acquired by an enterprise.

697
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,039
If they don't care about

698
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,880
the research and protection of new minerals,

699
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,480
that'll be bad.

700
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,359
Do you know which company it is?

701
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,680
I can contact them.

702
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,599
I think so.

703
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,480
We are Mu.

704
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,000
We are the Mu family.

705
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
The length of service

706
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,760
of several mines of our company

707
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,760
Is almost coming,

708
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,559
If there's no new mines

709
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,480
for mining,

710
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,079
the next few years,

711
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,000
the Group's entire production capacity

712
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,039
will decline steeply.

713
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,320
So the board and I

714
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,079
we hope to launch the project as soon as possible.

715
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,079
The production capacity

716
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,119
the production capacity in Yiliangshan mine.

717
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,159
Don't worry too much.

718
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,519
The Group acquired

719
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,760
a few mining areas will be ready

720
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,440
will be put into production right away.

721
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,320
That's great!

722
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,679
However,

723
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,719
the Yiliang Mountain

724
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,400
the Yiliang Mountain can't be sealed forever.

725
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,920
Right.

726
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,280
They said new minerals

727
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
In Yiliangshan mine.

728
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,199
Conservation research is needed.

729
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,440
But this protection has lasted for over two years.

730
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,360
Of this kind of protection

731
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
with no result.

732
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
That's a lot of money.

733
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,599
Even if you throw it into the water,

734
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,639
It should make some noise.

735
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Right?

736
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,679
That's right.

737
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,639
Huron, I know.

738
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,639
You're just as passionate

739
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,440
you're passionate about geology.

740
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,239
However, we Mu Clan...

741
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,719
We have so many people.

742
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,840
You have a family to support.

743
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,920
We can't be there for you all the time.

744
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,719
Let them waste your time.

745
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:21,920
Don't worry.

746
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm the head of Mu's Group.

747
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,000
I will be responsible

748
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,920
and the shareholders.

749
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,119
The research institute

750
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,239
will arrive soon

751
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,519
a new batch of ore samples

752
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,119
when the test results are out,

753
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,840
once it is found that it has no value for scientific research,

754
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,480
I'll announce that I will return to work.

755
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,559
Alright.

756
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,079
All right, Mr. Mu.

757
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,840
Please sign

758
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,079
the authorization document.

759
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
If there is no new mineral,

760
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,519
authorize Mr. Mu Min Guang to

761
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,639
to take full responsibility

762
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,679
the mining in Yiliangshan Mine.

763
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,480
That is,

764
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,400
It can reassure everyone.

765
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,960
Right?

766
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,559
Right.

767
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,920
If a rare mineral

768
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,400
In Yiliangshan Mine,

769
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,679
we will definitely

770
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,840
fully support Mr. Mu

771
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,920
for further research.

772
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:03,840
Right?

773
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,000
Yes

774
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,239
alright.

775
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,519
Miss Su.

776
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,199
Mr. Mu, your lunch is here.

777
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,559
Put it here.

778
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,639
You don't want to eat?

779
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,400
What brings you here?

780
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,119
Why did you come to see me today?

781
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,639
To bring you lunch.

782
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,719
I washed and cut it by myself.

783
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,760
And I personally pack them.

784
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Let me have a look.

785
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,960
Washed and cut by hand.

786
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,599
So many dishes.

787
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,599
I don't think so.

788
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,320
I don't think so.

789
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,639
I mean that

790
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,840
It looks delicious.

791
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,480
Are you scared?

792
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,679
I'll cook other things for you.

793
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,840
Why would I be?

794
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,920
Why would you be?

795
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,360
What I mean is

796
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,039
your hands

797
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:03,519
they will be used

798
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,840
or to dig rocks.

799
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,159
Cooking is not a big deal.

800
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,280
Leave it to me.

801
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,280
I have something serious to tell you today.

802
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,400
What business?

803
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,800
The Mu family has a mine in Yiliang Mountain, right?

804
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,800
Look at this.

805
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
This was the last time

806
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,840
that my mentor took

807
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,280
when he inspected China,

808
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,719
he has found suspected new mineral

809
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,199
the existence of some new minerals.

810
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:28,960
Are you sure about that?

811
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
There are not enough samples.

812
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,280
So we can't be

813
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,360
a hundred percent sure about it.

814
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,920
I want to know

815
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,679
have you mined that mine?

816
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,400
The research department of Mu's

817
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,239
they did find

818
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,599
In the Yellow River.

819
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,480
So they stopped mining

820
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,559
the mining stopped.

821
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,320
But all the research results

822
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
of the research results

823
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,760
are not ideal.

824
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,360
So this report of yours

825
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,800
really important to us.

826
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,199
Because it could

827
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
that it proves that

828
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
our persistence and hard work

829
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,559
to be true.

830
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
My mentor is worried that

831
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,760
that your company

832
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,000
to pursue economic efficiency,

833
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,480
so they didn't care about scientific research at all.

834
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,599
But now I know that

835
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,679
you're also studying

836
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,199
we're relieved.

837
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,880
But there's something

838
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,559
I need to tell you in advance.

839
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:09,760
What is it?

840
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,599
If Yiliang Mountain is found

841
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,840
and suspect a new mineral,

842
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,239
then the result and declaration

843
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,360
must be of China.

844
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,440
So, before getting the authentication,

845
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
I can't give you the samples

846
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
to you for research.

847
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,280
I don't mean anything else.

848
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,760
You also know that

849
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,199
the discovery of a new mineral

850
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,559
are the most important things

851
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,159
the level of research

852
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,239
of mineral research

853
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,159
of mineral research

854
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,559
and modern analysis technology.

855
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,760
That's why

856
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
this result.

857
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,320
Don't worry. I know the rules.

858
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,400
As long as I can guarantee

859
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,360
the new minerals

860
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,960
are protected

861
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,079
and studied.

862
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,599
Thank you.

863
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,639
When are you going to

864
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,039
tell your brother about it?

865
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,400
You said that

866
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,360
because of work recently,

867
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,800
for work recently?

868
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,280
When he's in a better mood,

869
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,440
when he's in a good mood.

870
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,239
I don't want you

871
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,639
to bump into him

872
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,000
and put you in an awkward situation.

873
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
If we don't take the initiative,

874
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,320
It will be more trouble if he breaks it.

875
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,679
He didn't notice it for a long time.

876
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,039
That I have a thing for you.

877
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,480
It's even more impossible to know now.

878
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,280
That's right.

879
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,519
After all, he is an emotional idiot.

880
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,719
It's cold?

881
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,280
A little.

882
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,159
Do you feel better now?

883
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,559
No, I'm fine.

884
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,880
Then let's get in the car.

885
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,920
Gao Ling, I think you're the idiot.

886
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,440
Don't pick up.

887
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,559
This is your brother's exclusive ring tone.

888
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,519
You two have your own ringtone?

889
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,760
I don't even have one.

890
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,000
I was worried that

891
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
so that he'd keep calling me.

892
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,679
I don't care.

893
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,000
Set a good example

894
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:22,880
alright.

895
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,639
I want this.

896
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,360
Are you satisfied?

897
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,800
I'll give you a girly kiss as your reward.

898
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,960
He's in a hurry.

899
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,320
Don't pick it up.

900
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,119
What are you doing, brother?

901
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,639
Hey, ask Gao Ling

902
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,840
to go back to the company.

903
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,239
How did you know

904
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,239
when we are together,

905
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,280
after work,

906
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,440
and saw you two leave together.

907
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,840
It must be you who took him to play.

908
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,679
Hurry. It's urgent.

909
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,480
That annoying Muhuron

910
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,480
always competing with me for the best.

911
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,440
And I was left

912
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,119
on my own.

913
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,480
Ask your wife what she's doing.

914
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,880
That's right. He's fighting for her.

915
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,039
I'll go for her.

916
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,320
Hello, Xiaoman.

917
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,039
Xiaoqin.

918
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,559
What's the matter?

919
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,360
She is a young girl.

920
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,639
Her brother

921
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,320
who lost her boyfriend.

922
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Is this debasement of morality

923
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,320
or a distortion of human nature?

924
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,639
I feel like I'm in a relationship

925
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,400
In a lonely relationship

926
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,239
gao Ling is good to you, right?

927
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,599
As good as before?

928
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,199
I don't have

929
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,760
of falling in love.

930
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,280
After he finishes his work,

931
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,760
he can work for a while.

932
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:31,800
Alright.

933
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:34,679
Sister-in-law, where are you?

934
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,119
I'll go find you.

935
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,719
I have something to do now.

936
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,039
At an event.

937
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,800
Something happened.

938
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,480
What activity?
