1
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:50,879
Calm down.

2
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,120
We said we'd face it together.

3
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,280
If you're not allowed to return from State S

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,159
to replace Jing,

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,599
wouldn't have ended up like this.

6
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560
You have your own responsibilities.

7
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,519
Jinqing, please leave.

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,200
I chose to come back.

9
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,400
That was our choice.

10
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,319
But now

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,719
only we can

12
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,919
give everyone an answer.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,159
I'm going to announce something today.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,960
Su Jin will

15
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,599
will leave the entertainment circle indefinitely.

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Everyone.

17
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,319
This is Su Jin.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,479
But I'm not just Su Jin.

19
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,759
What's going on?

20
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,639
Why do they look the same?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
They look so alike.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,960
Hello everyone, this is Su Jin.

23
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,199
I admit that

24
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,400
my sister and I

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,599
as twins,

26
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,280
I've deceived the audience

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,199
fellow film fans.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
I lied to you.

29
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,159
Sorry.

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,759
This is only the plan

31
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,719
of our sisters' plan.

32
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,800
Mr. Mu knew nothing about it.

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,879
Once again, I sincerely apologize

34
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,080
from the bottom of my heart.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
The Substitute Su Jin Incident

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
that has caused a lot of confusion recently.

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
The truth is out today.

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,319
Sisters Su

39
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,599
on the same stage.

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
She apologized on the spot.

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,000
She announced that she would quit

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,960
from the entertainment circle

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,120
to devote herself to public service.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
To take the place of her sister

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,319
It is revealed that

46
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,960
holds a doctor of geology.

47
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,080
The two sisters announced that

48
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,800
It'll be easier for you.

49
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,159
Me too.

50
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,560
The two could face huge compensation.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
Mu Heulun's Group...

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,599
Are suspected to be the victims.

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,319
The business has picked up again.

54
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,600
Have a good rest. Don't be stressed.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
Just do what you want to do.

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,319
We are here.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
We will always

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,839
are your supporters!

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Child,

60
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,519
I've watched the press conference.

61
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,279
Come home with Huron.

62
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,040
I will prepare

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,319
for the first time.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Xiaoqin, where are you?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
My brother has been looking for you like crazy.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,959
From Ji Shi

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
mr. Muthurun.

68
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,279
Sorry.

69
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,879
When you see this letter,

70
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,160
I've already returned to some

71
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
without signal.

72
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,800
My advisor said the project is urgent,

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
and lack of personnel.

74
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,040
I don't know how long

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,240
how long and far this trip will take.

76
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,000
I also know

77
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,800
this isn't an excuse

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,319
to leave now.

79
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,959
But sorry,

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,959
please forgive my

81
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,240
this selfish decision.

82
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,920
And everything you went through in the past six months,

83
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,240
I still remember

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
Is still vivid.

85
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,720
Every moment I spent with you

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,319
Is always unforgettable.

87
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,720
I've never been so infatuated

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,560
the feeling of being with someone.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,879
But this incident

90
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,720
calmed me down.

91
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,920
If I didn't leave,

92
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,000
the clarifications that Qin and I have made

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,160
would be futile.

94
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,800
If I continue to be with you,

95
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,639
the public opinions will plunge Mu Clan

96
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,319
a worse reputation crisis.

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
This relationship

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,839
needs you and your

99
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,160
for your career.

100
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,879
I'd rather it ended here.

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Mu Huron.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,639
Thank you for bringing me

103
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,040
a wonderful journey with me.

104
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,000
There's still a long way to go.

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,959
I wish your future

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,959
a bright future.

107
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,879
Mr. Mu,

108
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,800
you may have cavities because

109
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,360
you may have cavities.

110
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
Congratulations, Mr. Mu.

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,519
Congratulations.

112
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,000
Congratulations.

113
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
A cheerful person is refreshed.

114
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,919
Excuse me for a moment.

115
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,559
Alright.

116
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,879
Mom.

117
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,559
Why are you crying?

118
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,519
Huron.

119
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,960
I've waited too long

120
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
for too long.

121
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,759
If your father was alive,

122
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,720
how happy he must be

123
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
to see all these.

124
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,159
We've heard

125
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,559
mr. Gao Ling's oath.

126
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,200
Next,

127
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,879
to ask Miss Mu Xiao Man

128
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,799
I thought Xiaoman would come back

129
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,120
will bring her back.

130
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,200
That's Huron.

131
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,559
It's yours.

132
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,399
She won't get away.

133
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,039
You won't let her get away,

134
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,960
right?

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Ms. Mu Xiaoman,

136
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,399
are you willing to

137
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,960
In sickness and in health,

138
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,279
In sickness and in health,

139
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
to Mr. Gao Ling...

140
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,279
Till the end of time?

141
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,840
Yes, I would.

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,639
All right.

143
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,240
Couple please exchange rings.

144
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,440
I didn't expect that

145
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,720
xiaoman has arrived earlier than you.

146
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,679
Will you marry me?

147
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,840
Yes, I will.

148
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,159
Groom, please kiss

149
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,080
your beautiful and lovely bride.

150
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,000
Alright.

151
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,240
This paper is good.

152
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,759
Passed.

153
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
I revised it 20 times.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
Finally passed.

155
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,639
I can finally understand

156
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,679
I can feel that screenwriters

157
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,200
how they would feel

158
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,159
after hearing this song.

159
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,639
To keep him company.

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,039
Your metaphor is...

161
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,039
Interesting.

162
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,960
At least you're willing to bring up

163
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
talk about showbiz.

164
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
This year,

165
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,159
exploration this year.

166
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,960
This is considered as a contribution

167
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,840
for the vacancy you left

168
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,679
to make up for it.

169
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
Get ready.

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,519
Invite your family and friends

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
to attend

172
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
doctor graduation ceremony!

173
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,200
Miss Su.

174
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,519
I'm waiting for your postcard.

175
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Sister Su, it's hard to lead a rookie.

176
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,159
I miss you and Jin Qing so much.

177
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:27,799
Sweetheart.

178
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,559
Guess who am I doing makeup for?

179
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,759
Sister-in-law, I am married.

180
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,759
My brother will be envious

181
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,600
my brother would envy me so much.

182
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,720
Xiaoman and Gao Ling wanted to hold the wedding

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
to hold the wedding after you came back.

184
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
But now they have the baby.

185
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,759
They can't wait any longer.

186
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,039
It seems

187
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,519
I feel a little impatient again.

188
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,039
The company's report for this year

189
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,799
came out today.

190
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,759
And achieved good results.

191
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,440
After that, I can steadily develop

192
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,679
the development of new energy.

193
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,879
Where there is loss, there is gain.

194
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,279
It can fulfill the wish

195
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,559
my father and I realized.

196
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,919
The power of time is amazing.

197
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,679
Everything will pass.

198
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,399
Although spring is blossoming,

199
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,960
It's windy outside.

200
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,480
Wear more.

201
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,240
Are you watching this?

202
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,840
I was talking to Professor Zhang today.

203
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,399
He said that to a geologist,

204
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,320
10,000 years is just a blink of an eye.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,519
Maybe this is the reason

206
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,240
you left me suddenly

207
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,399
all these years.

208
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
But I can't have this life for ten thousand years.

209
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,799
I only have a short life.

210
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,679
Ji Shi, if you want to come back,

211
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
the rest of my life

212
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
are all yours.

213
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Hello, Professor?

214
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Su.

215
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,360
In the next few days,

216
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,080
there's a young entrepreneur

217
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,159
from the new mineral and energy fields

218
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,480
to give a lecture on industry.

219
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,960
Something has come up and I can't make it.

220
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,440
Please attend it for me.

221
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,399
New energy.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
The first scene is at 4: 30 p.m.

223
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
You can't be late.

224
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,000
It's already four o'clock.

225
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,799
Thank you.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Alright.

227
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,399
Do you know

228
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,720
who's giving a speech this time?

229
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
I heard that she's very pretty.

230
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,279
He is a young entrepreneur

231
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,600
In the new energy field.

232
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Major in geology.

233
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,000
To join the business circle

234
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,840
sorry.

235
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,559
Do you know

236
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,559
who is the speaker today?

237
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,120
I think the surname is Mu.

238
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,080
What's his name?

239
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
Is that him?

240
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,240
Hi, everyone.

241
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,600
My family name is Mo. I'm from China.

242
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,480
In China,

243
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,440
new energy has been a cutting edge field.

244
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,159
From 2000 to 2018,

245
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,000
what are you doing?

246
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,759
How could it be him?

247
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,960
From Ji Shi,

248
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,599
was the earthquake there?

249
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,319
Currently, from the energy supply

250
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,880
the safety and clean use

251
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
and clean use.

252
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,559
Many countries

253
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,839
are turning to the commercialization

254
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,920
the commercialization of solar energy

255
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,759
as an important development direction.

256
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,200
The signing of the Kyoto Protocol,

257
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,279
the environmental protection policy.

258
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,119
The adoption of environmental policies

259
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,720
(will bring an opportunity)

260
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,680
To our solar energy industry.

261
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,400
The development of the western region

262
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,680
(to provide a huge domestic market)

263
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,119
To provide a huge domestic market.

264
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,880
The adjustment of our energy strategy

265
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,640
has led the government to increase

266
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,839
to increase its support

267
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,440
the development of renewable resources.

268
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,319
All these

269
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,559
are for the utilization of solar energy in our country.

270
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,160
Your boyfriend?

271
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,400
What?

272
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,920
I was thinking that after Xiaoman got married,

273
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,519
you can stay with us

274
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,839
with us for a few more days.

275
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,119
The company just got started.

276
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,359
There are still a lot of things to deal with.

277
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,960
Brother.

278
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,359
Don't go.

279
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,480
Watch it progress.

280
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,359
Slow down.

281
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,920
The sister-in-law's mentor

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
about her project

283
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,160
the project in Africa

284
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,119
has ended.

285
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,960
Go to get her back.

286
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,039
Son!

287
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,359
Alright, my two young ladies

288
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,599
you two

289
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,839
don't worry about that.

290
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,039
I know what I'm doing.

291
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,319
I need to deal with something.

292
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,079
I've got to settle something.

293
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,640
Hurry up! Let me see what is it?

294
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,200
Translate it for me.

295
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,440
This is the letter

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
demanding your resignation.

297
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,559
I, Mu Min Guang,

298
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,799
In the past few decades.

299
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,640
I think

300
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,880
I did not disappoint my brother and his wife

301
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
and the Mu family.

302
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,240
I admit I have done something

303
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,319
cheat you.

304
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,519
Because I still don't want to.

305
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,079
I'm not willing to take the world

306
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,160
from us decades ago

307
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,200
to an outsider like you.

308
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,799
We've been fighting for years.

309
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,319
We are all thinking

310
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,319
are thinking the same thing.

311
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,240
Is to protect our family.

312
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,359
I know that

313
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,079
maybe you won't recognize me

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,759
to be a member of the Mu family in this life.

315
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,880
It doesn't matter.

316
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,000
In my heart,

317
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,240
you'll always be my second uncle.

318
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,200
You can come

319
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,200
don't always bring

320
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
every time.

321
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,200
They might think I took bribes.

322
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Aunty Sun.

323
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,359
I grew up here.

324
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,119
It's my job to take care of the children.

325
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,640
Alright.

326
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,519
Thank you, Auntie Sun.

327
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,759
Brother Huron.

328
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,720
Brother Huron.

329
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,960
Brother Huron.

330
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,359
You haven't come to see us for a long time.

331
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,160
I have been busy lately.

332
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,759
Alright.

333
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,440
Honey, I need to pick up the phone.

334
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,160
Come here.

335
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,480
Stop quarreling.

336
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,599
Zihao is answering the phone.

337
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
Be good and wait for him.

338
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
And give you gifts.

339
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,960
It's ready.

340
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
We can set out any time.

341
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,160
Great!

342
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,079
I really admire you.

343
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,680
That you could take a plane

344
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
like a subway.

345
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,839
Can't I wait for one day?

346
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,960
I've waited for a whole year!

347
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,720
But now,

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,799
to calm down for one more day.

349
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,759
Even it's a waste.

350
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,880
In addition,

351
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,160
we have a lot of preparation to do.

352
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,880
Alright. It's up to you.

353
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,079
She hung up.

354
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,359
Sister, I know.

355
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,920
I will definitely come to the graduation ceremony.

356
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,640
But I heard that

357
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
usually, the couple

358
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
their date there.

359
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,440
Stop it.

360
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,680
In the past year,

361
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,039
a lot of wild elephants in Africa this year.

362
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,079
Do you have a partner?

363
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,759
Sis, do you regret it sometimes?

364
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
I shouldn't have left.

365
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
I have nothing to regret.

366
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,240
He and I weren't meant

367
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,359
we weren't meant to be together.

368
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Sis,

369
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,920
to meet someone who loves you,

370
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,839
who loves you.

371
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,160
I think

372
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,000
mu Huren is serious to you.

373
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
Alright, I got it.

374
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,799
I'll make my own decision.

375
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,240
Forget about it.

376
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,359
Is about to start.

377
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,839
Hi, everyone.

378
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,160
This is our last meeting today.

379
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,359
I invited

380
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,400
from China to share

381
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,160
to share information with you.

382
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,279
Welcome Mr. Muhuelun,

383
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,039
the President of Binhai New Energy Company.

384
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,279
Hi, everyone.

385
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm the guest sharing today.

386
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,079
My name is

387
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,240
mu Huron.

388
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,880
In recent years,

389
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,559
china has invested a lot of resources

390
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,880
to promote the development of new energy industry.

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Nationwide,

392
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,400
all kinds of large-scale

393
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,319
all kinds of large-scale

394
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,519
doctor Su.

395
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,240
There are aftershocks too. Be careful.

396
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,079
Doctor Su.

397
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,599
Su Jishi.

398
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,759
Hello. He's calling you.

399
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,319
Long time no see

400
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,319
long time no see

401
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,880
I never thought we could meet here.

402
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,079
Really?

403
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,759
By the way, I heard that

404
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,200
your cooperation

405
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
of our university

406
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,000
to open

407
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,039
of geology together.

408
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,160
Congratulations

409
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,200
your business is bigger.

410
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:11,880
It's because of you?

411
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,240
I came here

412
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,640
to...

413
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,680
Sorry

414
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,119
hey.

415
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,200
Alright.

416
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,799
I'll be right there.

417
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,400
The reason isn't important.

418
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,680
We now

419
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,640
nothing to do with me now.

420
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,799
Hello, Miss Mo.

421
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:48,960
Alright.

422
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,839
I have to go now.

423
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,079
Mr. Mu,

424
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,160
my student

425
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
can act as your

426
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,960
your museum project.

427
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,759
I hope you'll have a good cooperation.

428
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,160
What about

429
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,599
can you complete the task?

430
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,119
Mr Qu.

431
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,319
Why does it have to be me?

432
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,160
Who makes you so outstanding?

433
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,799
You have finalized the manuscript in advance

434
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,000
before we submitted the thesis.

435
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,319
You are the best fit

436
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,279
you're the most suitable one.

437
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,319
And...

438
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,839
Both of you are from Chinese.

439
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,200
And it's convenient for you to communicate.

440
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,079
Luckily, Mr. Mu

441
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,519
mr. Mu invested in

442
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,559
an exhibition

443
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,079
with new minerals as the theme,

444
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,720
your research direction

445
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,759
what about

446
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
It's the right choice

447
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
to be the exhibit advisor.

448
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,720
Professor.

449
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Thank you for your support to the museum.

450
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,680
And I hope Dr. Su

451
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,000
your kind assistance in the future.

452
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
You're welcome, Mr. Mu.

453
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,359
To have a talented young man like you

454
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,400
and an excellent entrepreneur

455
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,279
to be able to follow

456
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:06,880
our geological cause,

457
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,599
Is very important

458
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,640
to our researcher,

459
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,400
you're very pleased.

460
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm glad to be of any help

461
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,000
that you can help.

462
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,519
Next, I'll leave my good student

463
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,440
to you.

464
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,039
Alright.

465
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,319
Good cooperation!

466
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,200
Have a good cooperation.

467
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,839
I'll leave now.

468
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,720
Goodbye, Mr. Qu.

469
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,480
I'm going to cooperate with you again.

470
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,759
I suddenly feel that

471
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,960
this is a good start.

472
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,240
If you need anything,

473
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
you can come to me anytime.

474
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,519
If you have nothing to do now,

475
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,440
I'll leave now.

476
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,680
This is my work report

477
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,440
for the past year.

478
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,119
Please have a look, Dr. Su.

479
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,200
Alright.

480
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,160
The kids of Sun Village

481
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,160
all missed you.

482
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,160
After that incident,

483
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,799
It took me a year

484
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
on all the projects and contracts

485
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,519
of Mu's Group

486
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,960
and merged.

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,799
It was originally a mining company

488
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,720
from a traditional mining company

489
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
Into a new mining company

490
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,880
new energy development and research.

491
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,759
I will lead

492
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,519
of the new energy.

493
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,440
I have the final say.

494
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,079
Congratulations.

495
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,839
After the company stabilized,

496
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,240
I've also looked for

497
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
the professional media

498
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,759
clarified and explained

499
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,720
the matter between us.

500
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,519
The public

501
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,359
about that matter

502
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,279
has calmed down a lot.

503
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,079
That's Ji Shi.

504
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,440
Don't you still understand, Mu Hurun?

505
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,160
You thought it was all over.

506
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,559
But what has happened

507
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,640
will never pass.

508
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,759
As long as we're still in touch.

509
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,480
The speculation and gossip

510
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
will never be gone.

511
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,519
And I will never stop

512
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,440
In the future.

513
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,160
If we are together,

514
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
will only bring trouble.

515
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,079
I don't care about that.

516
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,079
You only care about

517
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,920
you care about

518
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,119
If I have any troubles.

519
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,480
But I only care about

520
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,440
Is my life.

521
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,319
I really don't know what I would do

522
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,839
without you.

523
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,640
It's not as simple

524
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,400
as you think.

525
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,599
It's been a year.

526
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,119
I've finished

527
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,000
everything.

528
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,480
There's only one thing

529
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,839
that's still affecting my plans.

530
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,799
The one.

531
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,400
I know you're tired

532
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,279
waiting for me.

533
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,799
So this time,

534
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,559
I won't listen to you anymore.

535
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I will come to you.

536
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
One year is too long.

537
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm in case you forget.

538
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,839
I have to remind you.

539
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,319
He is the man

540
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,319
to your proposal.

541
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,119
I proposed for Su Jin at that time,

542
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,440
not for myself.

543
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,319
I know you will tell me.

544
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,160
At that time, you were still Su Jin.

545
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,440
But I must tell you that

546
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,640
I've always known that

547
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,519
that the person you like

548
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,480
that's Su Jishi.

549
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,640
A bold

550
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
a doctor of geology

551
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,680
and not

552
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,960
the hottest girl in showbiz, Su Jin.

553
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,720
You said back then that

554
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,559
but the water in the lake

555
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,119
for the water on the lake.

556
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,920
To the direction desired.

557
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,000
I want to tell you that

558
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,519
no matter how big the world is,

559
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,400
I will always be behind you.

560
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Follow you closely

561
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,279
If you are willing to,

562
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,440
to give me one more chance,

563
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,440
come here to find me.

564
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,920
Modawi Geological Museum.

565
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,759
I'll be waiting for you here.

566
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,759
Maybe it's great that we don't see you.

567
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,759
I don't think that much.

568
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,119
Hello, Su.

569
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:20,800
What's up

570
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,960
mentor, the thing is

571
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,480
It's about the consultant of the museum.

572
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,639
I think

573
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,719
you'd better find someone

574
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,559
to replace me.

575
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,400
It's so sudden.

576
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,519
What happened?

577
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,920
It's a long story

578
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,599
mentor, was there an aftershock?

579
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,599
That's right.

580
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,599
You weren't in the museum, were you?

581
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,519
No. Why?

582
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,679
That's good.

583
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,559
The museum has just been rebuilt.

584
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,519
He doesn't know about fire and safety.

585
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:49,960
What?

586
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,840
Finish the project.

587
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,159
I'm responsible for

588
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,800
for your safety.

589
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,679
Mu Huron.

590
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,599
Muhuron.

591
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:08,719
Muhuron.

592
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,199
Mu Huron.

593
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,440
Are you alright?

594
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,360
The exhibits are fine.

595
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,480
I'm asking if you're okay.

596
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,360
You are worried about me?

597
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,360
As long as the exhibits are fine.

598
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,039
I'm off.

599
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
You're obviously worried about me,

600
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:36,679
why are you hiding?

601
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,760
Now that you're here,

602
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,239
please give me some time.

603
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:47,920
What do you want?

604
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,519
A newly opened mineral museum

605
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,639
It's a success in our country.

606
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,199
He also brought these minerals

607
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,360
to show overseas.

608
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,400
This is a new mineral

609
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,360
our company discovered.

610
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,119
Because of your persistence,

611
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:07,559
I've fulfilled the promise

612
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,800
my promise with my father.

613
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,400
Can protect this scientific research data.

614
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,039
The new energy company

615
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,320
Is on track.

616
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,159
Thank you.

617
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,840
Congratulations.

618
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,159
Sorry for

619
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,599
I'm really sorry.

620
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,960
I didn't know at all

621
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,440
you must be very upset.

622
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,639
But I was not by your side.

623
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,199
I'm sorry.

624
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm really sorry.

625
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,440
As a consultant of the museum,

626
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,519
shouldn't you answer

627
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,519
all the questions I asked.

628
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,320
OK.

629
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,039
That's nice, Mr. Gao.

630
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,519
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gao.

631
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,599
Ms. Gao has a meeting at ten o'clock.

632
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,519
Got it.

633
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,280
Please.

634
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,400
You can help us with that time.

635
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,559
Run a string, okay?

636
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,320
In this way,

637
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,239
we can give you

638
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,119
20 minutes more.

639
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,000
You can take one more outfit

640
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
one more set.

641
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,000
All right.

642
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Thanks, honey.

643
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,360
Hey, honey.

644
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,039
Right.

645
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,800
Of the script,

646
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,239
the script needs to be revised.

647
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,239
The condition is

648
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,320
we really can't pick up

649
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,960
could you please talk to

650
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,199
with the script writer.

651
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,039
Xia,

652
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,199
she's overweight again this month.

653
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,760
If that's the case,

654
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,880
focus on her this month.

655
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,559
To make her reach the standard weight.

656
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,039
But I can't stop her

657
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,119
I can't stop her.

658
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,599
If she wants this role,

659
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,599
she must match

660
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,039
to fit the character.

661
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,039
This is the basic respect

662
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:16,920
for the role.

663
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,159
As her assistant,

664
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,079
you should help her

665
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,320
do her job better.

666
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,000
Nothing could stop her.

667
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,920
What do you have to do?

668
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
Okay, Xia. I'll go now.

669
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,920
Just go.

670
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,360
Shan is waiting for us.

671
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Let's wait a little longer.

672
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,199
Let me confirm it again.

673
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,119
You've finished

674
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,960
for these two days.

675
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,199
If you're done, you can send them to one click.

676
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,400
We won't delay your progress.

677
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,440
Your suit is ironed. Change it in the car.

678
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,440
That's nice.

679
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,519
My Xiaoxia

680
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,360
has become

681
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,000
to become an independent Mr. Wu.

682
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,960
But in front of Fang Jie,

683
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
xiao Xia was always that girl.

684
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,480
That sweet talker.

685
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,360
Come on.

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,719
Next is the most important

687
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,800
the most important schedule.

688
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,239
Okay, let's first welcome

689
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,559
the members of the Mu family

690
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,239
to our wedding.

691
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,039
They are

692
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,000
the former president of Mu's Group

693
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,159
and his mother,

694
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,679
and the new president of Mu's Group

695
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,760
and his wife.

696
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,039
We noticed that

697
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,880
a very important guest

698
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,599
on the red carpet.

699
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,480
Who is that?

700
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,000
Let's look forward to the performance

701
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,639
we've already seen

702
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,679
the main character tonight

703
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,480
miss Su

704
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,440
on the red carpet.

705
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,000
Su Jishi,

706
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,519
I'll keep you company today.

707
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,480
Until you're in love.

708
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,719
Did you really love each other?

709
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,440
Would you

710
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,480
marry each other?

711
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Really

712
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,320
please answer.

713
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,199
Please answer directly.

714
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,400
Miss Su Jin and I

715
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,880
no matter what will happen

716
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,000
or encounter in the future,

717
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,199
our relationship

718
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
will never change.

719
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Everyone has something

720
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,039
something to protect.

721
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,360
But at the same time,

722
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,519
you'll have to pay the price.

723
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,400
Whether it's to friends

724
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,599
to our relatives,

725
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,719
or

726
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,559
you should be honest

727
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,880
with the one you like.

728
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,960
Cheating won't solve anything.

729
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I told you,

730
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,079
If there's anything,

731
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,400
I'll face it together with you.

732
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,719
I'm your boyfriend.

733
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,480
I'm not an outsider.

734
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,360
From today on,

735
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm your man.

736
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,719
So no matter

737
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,679
no matter where you go,

738
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,000
you can't leave me behind.

739
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,039
As you all know,

740
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,599
It's really hard for the two of you

741
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,760
to be together.

742
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,360
They've gone through

743
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,440
the twists and turns in a movie.

744
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,639
As the two newlyweds said,

745
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,920
for the universe,

746
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,519
ten thousand years is just a blink of an eye

747
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,679
two people finally

748
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,400
their happy ending.

749
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,840
It's your idea, isn't it?

750
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,800
This evening

751
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,639
not only our group banquet,

752
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,239
what about

753
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,000
with the show?

754
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,880
Is also a wedding celebration

755
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,159
wedding ceremony

756
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,119
tonight, we'll witness

757
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,360
a very happy moment.

758
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,360
Great!

759
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,960
With great excitement,

760
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,000
and look forward to it.

761
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,239
Tonight's ceremony officially begins.

762
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,119
What about

763
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,119
have you thought it out?

764
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,280
Certainly.

765
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,079
So your answer is?

766
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
Let's end it here.

767
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,639
Let's start over again.

768
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,440
To me,

769
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:15,679
you've wandered through

770
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,159
In Murmansk.

771
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,880
To me,

772
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,400
you are the fullness

773
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,559
the long river of Amazon depression.

774
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,760
We're attracted to each other.

775
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,519
And explore more.

776
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,719
At this moment,

777
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,119
I'm very sure

778
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,239
I am willing to.
