1
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,239
Mu Huron.

2
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,840
You are distorting the terms of the contract.

3
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,799
You can have doubts on the contract,

4
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,640
you can also hire a lawyer

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
and have it revised by a lawyer.

6
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,560
But before we modify it,

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,480
you have to strictly execute

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
the terms in front of you.

9
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,799
Of course,

10
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,000
you can also directly breach the contract.

11
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,480
That's going too far

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,400
forget about it.

13
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,200
I'll tolerate it.

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
One week? No way.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Two days.

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
There is a chance.

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,879
Six days.

18
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,879
Three days.

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,360
Five days.

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,159
Done.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
Perfect.

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
Miss Su, and then?

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,319
I feel guilty if you keep silent.

24
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,599
How's Mr. Mu?

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,479
Everything is fine.

26
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,159
He has also taken

27
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,960
the wardrobe

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't think our contract mentioned

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,639
we can't kick out the first party,

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,479
right?

31
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,439
Please,

32
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,199
please spare my life.

33
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,560
If you kick Mr. Mu out,

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,319
this will be the news

35
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,479
on the internet tomorrow.

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,159
Our whole team

37
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,400
has to make a living.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,199
Mr. Mu,

39
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,560
stay here for a few days.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
In these few days,

41
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,439
can you end things peacefully?

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,479
Please.

43
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,479
Come on.

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,280
There are traces of life

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
of Su Jin and me.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,599
If he finds it out,

47
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,199
we won't be able to

48
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,879
as simple as that.

49
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,879
Will bring lawsuits.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
Alright, I'll hang up now.

51
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,439
This Muhurun...

52
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,039
Be more annoying?

53
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,800
You've got so many geology books at home,

54
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,439
but you still don't admit that you care about me.

55
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,159
This row of books is my collection.

56
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,879
Don't touch them.

57
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,000
Not this one either.

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,120
Su Jin,

59
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,080
I'm really curious.

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,439
Why you were so interested

61
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,960
In geology?

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,039
Shoot.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,080
I don't want you to find any excuse

64
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,080
there is a special hobby

65
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,400
that doesn't need a reason at all.

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Or is it Mr. Mu?

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,879
You're just like the others.

68
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,159
As the others.

69
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,479
That female entertainers like me

70
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,879
should have a blank brain

71
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,400
and only interested in shopping.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
That's not what I mean.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
I just want to say

74
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,759
you haven't mentioned it before.

75
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,159
You are interested in geology.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
You can even say it's a study.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,759
Also,

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
you didn't dare to

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
to look at me like that before.

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
I would even

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,079
and dare not get so close to me.

82
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,759
Since Mr. Mu

83
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,240
also asked the same question,

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
I want to ask you.

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,759
When did you become

86
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,879
so concerned about me?

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,399
No, I didn't.

88
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,240
Three years ago,

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
of Parasol's brand

90
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,240
I just helped you

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,160
while I was smoothing your tie.

92
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,199
You shied away from me.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,399
When you held the press conference two years ago,

94
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,399
you couldn't even arm in arm.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Also,

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,360
you didn't dare

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,199
to get so close to me before.

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,360
Your ears would not be

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,879
as red as these.

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Mr. Mu,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,279
those who have changed

102
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,879
who has changed

103
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,639
Is it me or you?

104
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,199
I'm not!

105
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
What is this?

106
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,439
What have I done?

107
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
Don't blush.

108
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,279
I am not blushing.

109
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,519
Anyone home?

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,399
The door was open.

111
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,279
I just...

112
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,759
By myself.

113
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,920
Mom, you are here.

114
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,199
Little Jin.

115
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:13,959
You two

116
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,199
are so close.

117
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm just relieved.

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
We won't talk about the fight.

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,959
How could it be?

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Huron and I

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,959
are really close.

122
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,600
So,

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,959
you don't have to waste your precious time

124
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,279
on us.

125
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,600
You're right.

126
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,920
I think

127
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
I really don't need

128
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,079
waste more time.

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,079
That's why

130
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,040
I've decided

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll stay here with you

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,079
let's stay here for a week.

133
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,360
One week?

134
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
Let me check the house.

135
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,839
Great.

136
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,839
That's what a actress looks like.

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,439
This house is so arty.

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
You've lived here for so long.

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
It's really good.

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,079
Let your mom go back.

141
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,519
I can't handle it.

142
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,279
Do you want to expose yourself?

143
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,040
Muhuron.

144
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,000
Mom, let me show you around the back.

145
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,000
Alright.

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,959
How about I leave?

147
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,920
What should I do?

148
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,560
Please save me.

149
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,639
That stingy boy!

150
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
He always meddles in my relationship.

151
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
Let me never meet him.

152
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,680
Are you still angry?

153
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,319
Nothing.

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Nothing.

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
You ran away when you saw me.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,759
Are you afraid that I will eat you?

157
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,399
Get off!

158
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,800
I don't want to talk to you.

159
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,000
Girl has quite a temper.

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,399
What's for lunch today?

161
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,839
There's a new hot pot restaurant.

162
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,199
How about we try it?

163
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,000
Alright.

164
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,000
How about

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,079
no. I'm not hungry.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,079
I didn't talk about the meal.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
I have an official inspection this afternoon.

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,120
Get ready

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,079
and come out with me.

170
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm not going. Take others with you.

171
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,680
Mu Xiaoman,

172
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,240
this is business.

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
You're the employee. I'm the boss.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,839
You should listen to the leader.

175
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,800
Also,

176
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,600
these are hidden projects

177
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,839
that the company has never announced.

178
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,439
Bring others there.

179
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,360
What if the confidential information is leaked?

180
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,879
This is the hidden project you mentioned?

181
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,799
That's right.

182
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,279
The theme park will be a new starting point

183
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
for the company to expand its business.

184
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,879
After our on-the-spot investigation,

185
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,399
the Development Department will talk to the acquisition.

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,799
Really?

187
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,240
Don't try to fool me.

188
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,759
Don't worry.

189
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,639
It's true.

190
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,600
Alright.

191
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,919
Please don't regret.

192
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,600
He's so lame.

193
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,519
I dare you again.

194
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,399
Mind your own business.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,600
It's done?

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,039
Die so soon?

197
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,840
So many inspection projects?

198
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
According to your procedure,

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
finish this process?

200
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,360
Mu Xiaoman,

201
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,720
you are giving me a hard time deliberately.

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Am I giving you a hard time

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
or you want to fool me?

204
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,039
How can I

205
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,759
you still think

206
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,879
you're taking me out

207
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,600
In the name of inspection,

208
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
that you can make me happy?

209
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,120
Xiaoman.

210
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,679
Do I look

211
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,480
Is it that easy to fool?

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,000
Xiaoman, I didn't mean that.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Gao Ling, I have grown up.

214
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
I have my own ideas and judgment.

215
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
I don't need you

216
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
to make any decision for me.

217
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,919
You don't need to coax me

218
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,200
a three-year-old child.

219
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,120
It's really...

220
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,080
Xiaoman.

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,639
And acting tough.

222
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,240
Now you've suffered.

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're still here?

224
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
I would have left earlier

225
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
I would have gone.

226
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,759
Are you all right?

227
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
As long as you're not angry,

228
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,480
you can torture me however you want.

229
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,519
You thought I would forgive you easily?

230
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
You know what?

231
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
If you dare to interfere

232
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,679
Interfere with my feelings,

233
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,600
see, I'd ignore you.

234
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,840
Alright then.

235
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,759
Let's go. I'll send you home.

236
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
What's up

237
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
you can't have fun since you're here.

238
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,840
Alright.

239
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,840
Have fun with you today

240
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,679
I want to play merry-go-round

241
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,200
great.

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,279
You need to grab dolls.

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
I'll catch all of them!

244
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
I'll follow your words.

245
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Come on.

246
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,200
Come on.

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
Catching dolls is like doing business.

248
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,159
You must find the right direction

249
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,080
and wait for the right time.

250
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,600
And act decisively.

251
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,080
Have a seat.

252
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,240
What a nice community.

253
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,519
Aunt Hua.

254
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,480
The rooms are very small.

255
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,799
Don't worry.

256
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,879
I don't mind.

257
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
I can sleep in that guest room.

258
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
That's too kind of you.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,399
I'm afraid you won't be used to staying here.

260
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,200
He said it's fine.

261
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,200
No, Xiaojin.

262
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,039
Do you not welcome Aunt Hua

263
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,360
to stay here?

264
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,759
Come on.

265
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,600
If you think I'm

266
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
your relationship.

267
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,080
How can I?

268
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,840
Mom.

269
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,919
You know

270
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,000
xiao Jin is very sensible

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
Is very sensible.

272
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
She is eager to let you stay.

273
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Am I right, Xiao Jin?

274
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,279
Well

275
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,559
I wish Aunt Hua could stay longer.

276
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,399
Alright.

277
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,399
I'll stay then.

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
All right.

279
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,840
It's getting late.

280
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Go to bed.

281
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,799
Sleep.

282
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

283
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,519
Oh no. I'm overreaching myself.

284
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,919
Something's wrong with the atmosphere.

285
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
Slowly.

286
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Not slow enough.

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,000
My legs really hurt.

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,559
I can't walk.

289
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
How about I wait for you here?

290
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,240
Go to the parking lot

291
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
go get the car.

292
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,399
I told you not to go far. Listen to me!

293
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,600
I know you're tired.

294
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
Here, take this.

295
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,679
Are you doing this?

296
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,320
I can't even walk. How dare you give me

297
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,039
negative.

298
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,440
Come on!

299
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
Don't just stand there.

300
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,279
Oh,

301
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,679
mu Xiaoman.

302
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,759
You are really not light.

303
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,240
I have so many dolls on me.

304
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,399
How can I not be heavy?

305
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,639
Right?

306
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,120
You bullied me.

307
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
Do you feel better now?

308
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,159
Because you bullied me.

309
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,279
Xiaoman.

310
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,879
Sorry.

311
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be so serious all of a sudden.

312
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,759
Your brother and I

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,639
Is for your own good.

314
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,759
Maybe I did it in the wrong way.

315
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
I do owe you an apology.

316
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,360
But I've watched you

317
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,759
since your childhood.

318
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,759
How could I?

319
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,840
Hurt you?

320
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Because a playboy hurts you?

321
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
I know.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,159
I don't blame you anymore.

323
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,000
However,

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,759
I still hope that in the future,

325
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,399
to make my own choice.

326
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,440
Life is a long journey.

327
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,039
You can't always

328
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,600
be with me forever, right?

329
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,759
I still have to grow up.

330
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,600
I got it.

331
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,120
From now on, you won't interfere

332
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,600
you would stop caring about me?

333
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,279
That's impossible.

334
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,279
I will still

335
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,879
and consider your feelings.

336
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,360
Gao Ling! You bastard!

337
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,440
Put me down! Hurry!

338
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,039
You want to go down again?

339
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,759
Gao Ling, I'm going to fall.

340
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,320
Are we still falling?

341
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,879
Isn't it fun than the roller coaster?

342
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,399
A little dizzy.

343
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,600
Xiaoman.

344
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,840
When you grow up,

345
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,480
and know how to protect yourself,

346
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,799
then I'll really leave you alone.

347
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:37,840
Go home.

348
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,519
Good night, Mum.

349
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,559
Alright, good night.

350
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:57,679
What are you thinking?

351
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,799
How could you bump into it?

352
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Nothing.

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,519
It's late.

354
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,600
I will sleep on the bed, you will sleep.

355
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,599
Good night.

356
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm sleeping on the floor.

357
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,880
How can I sleep like this?

358
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,640
Mu Huron?

359
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,400
These are not included in the terms of our cooperation.

360
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,000
The terms don't include

361
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,000
you can abuse her

362
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,279
what do you mean?

363
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,160
You let others sleep on the floor.

364
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,279
I didn't even give him a blanket. I wanted to freeze to death.

365
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,799
The quilt was in the second sleeping place.

366
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,920
I mean, who knew

367
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,319
that you would come with Ms. Hua.

368
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,519
In addition,

369
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,880
with so many luggage,

370
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,519
but you didn't even

371
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,319
without telling you.

372
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,359
It's late at night.

373
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,160
What if a man and a woman lie on a bed together?

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
Domestic trouble and foreign invasion

375
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,160
I have to think of a way.

376
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,480
Luckily, I have my protective bear.

377
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,640
Hey.

378
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,519
Isn't your bear a little

379
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,160
a little too big?

380
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,359
Don't move.

381
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,599
I am doing this to avoid...

382
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,799
To avoid any unnecessary accidents.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,359
You don't have to be afraid.

384
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,680
I won't do anything to you.

385
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,799
Mr. Mu, don't worry.

386
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,519
I won't have

387
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,160
have improper thoughts about you.

388
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,079
Su Jin,

389
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,839
that you have no improper feelings for me.

390
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,640
You do have improper thoughts about me.

391
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,720
I just regarded you as it.

392
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,559
Alright, I'll go and wash up.

393
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,160
And you said you have no feelings for me.

394
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,599
Stop pretending.

395
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,200
Su Jishi, what's wrong with you?

396
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,519
You've become so strange.

397
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,079
Why did you touch her?

398
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,880
Why don't you

399
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
look him in the eye?

400
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,279
My heart is beating so fast.

401
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:26,839
What's going on?

402
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,920
Are you out of your mind?

403
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,440
Alright.

404
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Get yourself together.

405
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,119
Right now,

406
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,799
and clear your mind!

407
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,799
Alright?

408
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,759
Do you want to go with me?

409
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,599
Calm down.

410
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,799
You've seen all kinds of scenes.

411
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,839
Fang Xie will come to pick me up.

412
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,920
Leave first.

413
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,640
Alright.

414
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,119
I'll leave first then.

415
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Xiaoman.

416
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,039
Is this the breakfast for me?

417
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,759
Secretary Gao, good morning.

418
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,519
Good morning.

419
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,359
High altitude.

420
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,359
Sorry.

421
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,000
This breakfast is for Secretary Gao.

422
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,039
Oh, right.

423
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,000
You asked me out for lunch?

424
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,720
I think we'll pass.

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
Why?

426
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,359
From now on,

427
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
I've decided to work hard

428
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,279
men only influence me

429
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,559
my progress.

430
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
So in the future,

431
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,240
I will refuse all

432
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,799
any unnecessary date.

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
Alright.

434
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,119
Here you are.

435
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,759
Very pleased.

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,799
You've grown up.

437
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,440
That's two different things.

438
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,559
I really want to work hard.

439
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,720
Thanks.

440
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,279
What should I do

441
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,599
to drive him out?

442
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,759
I can't stand that

443
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,640
I suddenly have a man in my family

444
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,839
a man in my family.

445
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,759
Isn't Mr. Mu's mother

446
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,400
mr. Mu's mother is good to you?

447
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,359
Just take it as an experience

448
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,599
family life.

449
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,240
No, Fang Xie.

450
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,079
Hold on.

451
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,960
Let me answer a call.

452
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,599
It's the magazine again.

453
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,400
Hey.

454
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Hello

455
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,519
yes, that's right. I am...

456
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,400
Please go ahead.

457
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,119
Sis,

458
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,000
can I request

459
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,440
to bring food to you every day?

460
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,759
Do you want to bring food?

461
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,839
Do you want to eat candy?

462
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,839
He caught me.

463
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,039
Silly girl.

464
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,920
How should I tell her

465
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
that she loves is a fake couple?

466
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,000
Sis, what did you say?

467
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,759
Nothing.

468
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,000
Send a message.

469
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,839
I heard that Mr. Mu cut off

470
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,480
with Tian Group for Su Jin.

471
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,039
With Tian Group without permission.

472
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,319
Has badly affected

473
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,720
on our business.

474
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
So the company decided

475
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,039
to elect the president again.

476
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,799
The company is going to be in big trouble.

477
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,880
I heard that the one likely to be elected

478
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,960
went against Mr. Mu.

479
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Vice President Mu Min Guang

480
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
to re-elect the president.

481
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,559
The denunciation meeting is finally over.

482
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,400
You Second Uncle

483
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,200
will never let go of any chance

484
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,599
to step on you.

485
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,799
Just get used to it.

486
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,880
Don't forget what I've told you to do.

487
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
In the next meeting,

488
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,359
the lower the spring is stepped on,

489
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,599
the higher it can be.

490
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
Since he wants to do it,

491
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,039
the Board of Directors, important tasks, the President,

492
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,559
then let him fire it.

493
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,400
Understood.

494
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,839
Mr. Mu,

495
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,759
It's really inconvenient for me to stay here.

496
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,039
For five days.

497
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,160
So please get Mrs. Hua

498
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
as soon as possible.

499
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,279
Thank you for your cooperation.

500
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,119
Why hasn't she replied?

501
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Hello, Xiaoman.

502
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,960
Sister.

503
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,839
If you see my brother tonight,

504
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,880
please comfort him.

505
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,799
Comfort him?

506
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,960
What's wrong with him?

507
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
Here is the thing.

508
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,200
Today, he had another conflict

509
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
had another conflict today.

510
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,880
I heard that it's because he stopped

511
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
between our company and Tian Group.

512
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,200
Now the shareholders are

513
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
are against him.

514
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,920
To re-elect the president.

515
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,559
Do you think

516
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,400
your brother cut off

517
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,119
with Tian Group.

518
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,480
Well

519
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,880
they said my brother

520
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
to love.

521
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,160
Where is your brother now?

522
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,640
In the company, I think.

523
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,440
But I can't

524
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
him now.

525
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,000
Don't worry.

526
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
I'll see him now.

527
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,240
Mr. Mu cut off the cooperation

528
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
with Tian Group for you.

529
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,359
Next time you beat a dog,

530
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,559
you don't have to play hardball.

531
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,319
You could

532
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,400
use some outside power

533
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm going to see him now.

534
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,640
Call me if you need anything.

535
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,079
Alright.

536
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,480
I'll ask Shan to send you back.

537
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,400
Come in.

538
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,400
Xiaoman told me that

539
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,400
you stopped

540
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,759
with Tian Group.

541
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,680
I really should

542
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,799
seal her mouth.

543
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,480
I also heard that your group

544
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,720
to re-elect the president.

545
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Are you all right

546
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,839
I'm alright.

547
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,319
Although Xiaoman says

548
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,000
you stopped the collaboration

549
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,559
because of me?

550
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,359
I think

551
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,519
you're not the kind of person

552
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,359
who will act rashly for women.

553
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:22,799
And you were definitely

554
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,200
leaving yourself a backup plan.

555
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,160
You have faith in me?

556
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,359
Well

557
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,519
over the years,

558
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,640
there were many times

559
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,200
I thought

560
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,519
they couldn't hold on anymore.

561
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,279
From the first day

562
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,200
to the company,

563
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,200
I was meticulous

564
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,359
In everything I do.

565
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,359
One step at a time,

566
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,359
every step

567
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
every step they take.

568
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,799
Just one wrong step

569
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,799
the ice will break.

570
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,359
And everything would be over.

571
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,559
It seems that you have more tiring

572
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,559
more tired than female artist.

573
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,599
Yes

574
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,240
you're right.

575
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,000
That's why

576
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,640
when I was little.

577
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,160
In front of everyone,

578
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,440
In front of so many cameras,

579
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,400
and gossip about you,

580
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,920
and be yourself happily.

581
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,400
It takes courage to be yourself.

582
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,880
That's why you're stronger than me.

583
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,599
It's true.

584
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,240
If you're tired,

585
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:50,640
I can lend you my shoulder

586
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,759
my shoulder to lean on.

587
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,279
As

588
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,119
Is to thank you.

589
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,759
Are you thanking me?

590
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,960
You're being too perfunctory.

591
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,759
What do you want then?

592
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,559
Before that thing you did to me

593
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,400
I was quite puzzled.

594
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,680
Do you still remember

595
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,799
do you remember anything from that night?

596
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Nothing.

597
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,359
No.

598
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,960
I didn't think of the night.

599
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,640
Did you take the initiative?

600
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,680
Then I'll help you recall.

601
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,519
Su Jishi, what are you doing now?

602
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,720
Do you remember now?

603
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,839
Mu Hurun, you...

604
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
It's a breach of cooperation.

605
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,880
I just did what

606
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
what you did to me.

607
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,079
I was drunk.

608
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,759
But you're sober now.

609
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
And 98.5 percent of your

610
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,839
the promiscuous feeling after drinking is for boldness.

611
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,640
What is that?

612
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,039
I'm talking about personality.

613
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,000
Why are you nervous?

614
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,240
I've figured out

615
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,559
It's getting late.

616
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,759
Come on.

617
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,480
He should be asleep.

618
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,920
Don't be frightened.

619
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,839
It suddenly occurred to me that

620
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,200
I have a contract to handle.

621
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,200
I just wanted to drink some water.

622
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,559
What?

623
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,839
I just took my phone.

624
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,319
Go to bed first.

625
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,519
You were just taking your phone?

626
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,440
Don't make people misunderstand me.

627
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,680
Here she comes.

628
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,599
What's wrong?

629
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,960
I didn't sleep well last night.

630
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,640
It's not that.

631
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,000
You didn't sleep well at all.

632
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
The last time I stayed up so late

633
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,240
when I was writing my thesis.

634
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
The paper?

635
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,519
Little Su, when did you

636
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,000
you wrote a thesis?

637
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,799
I wrote it in my dream.

638
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
You're so humorous.

639
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
You seem to be

640
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,839
not so well today.

641
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,680
How about after today's announcement

642
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,160
to get back to work.

643
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,119
I will turn down some for you

644
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:25,839
so you can go home and rest.

645
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,400
I can't.

646
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,680
You can't push me. I can't go home.

647
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm in great spirits.

648
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,720
I've given a job

649
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,839
work at all?

650
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,119
What happened last night

651
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,400
that was unbelievable.

652
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,039
What?

653
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,279
Mr. Mu, what kind of beast is that?

654
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,720
That you dare not go home?

655
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,279
Almost.

656
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,079
Sure enough, living together is

657
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,799
the situation affects your rest.

658
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,839
Wearing a new suit today.

659
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,880
It's not bad. Where did you buy it?

660
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Turn around and let me have a look.

661
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,119
Is it there?

662
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,640
I've worn it before.

663
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
You have nothing to do?

664
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,880
Have you done what I asked you to do?

665
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,920
I've handed the press release

666
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,160
the press release.

667
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,200
It should be out

668
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,079
In half an hour.

669
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:26,880
Right now,

670
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,519
the board meeting should have started.

671
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
Now, let's start

672
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,039
to vote by a show of hands.

673
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,519
I abstained.

674
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,720
President Chen didn't raise his hand.

675
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,839
You don't want to

676
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,839
to choose the president again?

677
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,400
As Huron's second uncle,

678
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
I'll revoke his appointment,

679
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,279
I also feel sorry for him.

680
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,720
But I had to.

681
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,240
The child is too young

682
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,599
be a law onto oneself

683
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,519
and caused the company

684
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,839
to the company.

685
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,039
Such a huge loss.

686
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,319
I believe everyone here

687
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,759
you all put the group's interest

688
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,359
first.

689
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,640
The interests of the shareholders.

690
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,839
What do you think, President Chen?

691
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,640
It's the highest.

692
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,000
The shareholders' meeting is about to begin.

693
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,480
Why is Ling Xiao still not attending?

694
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,920
It's not the time yet.

695
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,519
It's not the right time?

696
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,480
We'll lose our position if we don't move.

697
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
That's impossible.

698
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,839
The President?

699
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,359
Unless your brother doesn't want it anymore,

700
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,640
or no one can take it away from him.

701
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,759
But isn't the relationship

702
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,559
are very close.

703
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,559
How did this happen?

704
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,720
You wouldn't understand

705
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,240
you won't understand even if I tell you.

706
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,079
Is being mysterious.

707
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:45,960
Secretary Gao.

708
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,400
The press release is out.

709
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,839
Got it.

710
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,519
Alright.

711
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:58,640
President Chen.

712
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
The shareholders have voted

713
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,920
over half of it.

714
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,480
I announce that

715
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,039
from tomorrow,

716
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,079
hold on.

717
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
Please take out your phones

718
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,039
and check out the financial news.

719
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,119
With the latest news

720
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,920
It is about Tianche.

721
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
What are you doing this time?

722
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,480
There's a scandal about the car.

723
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,159
Any product problems.

724
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,079
More than 20,000 cars have been recalled.

725
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,360
As for Tianche,

726
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,920
has always been a very important

727
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,360
for Mu's Group in the past two years

728
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,960
for the past two years.

729
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,000
So the outsiders

730
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,119
cares about our cooperation

731
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,679
our cooperation with each other.

732
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,519
Therefore, the scandal

733
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,440
will definitely affect the reputation of the group

734
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,079
and affect our stock price.

735
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,679
So I terminated

736
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,360
I terminated the cooperation with them.

737
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,480
I want to

738
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,840
to minimize our loss.

739
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,039
I mentioned

740
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,599
I proposed at the meeting

741
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,840
that I proposed

742
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
of the Sun Village project.

743
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,400
I always believed in that

744
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,400
based on the personality of Mr. Mu,

745
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
that I would never harm the interests of shareholders

746
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,639
because of my personal affairs.

747
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,719
You were right about him.

748
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:15,719
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

749
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,920
Everyone,

750
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,480
I think

751
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,360
the vote can be canceled.

752
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,719
Is everyone okay with this?

753
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,280
Since all the shareholders are here,

754
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
I happen to have a question

755
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,159
that I want to ask you.

756
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,960
What is it?

757
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,840
You were the one

758
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,280
dealing with Hetian Auto Group.

759
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,119
They had such a big problem.

760
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,000
Don't you know that?

761
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,639
I just cooperate with them.

762
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
How can I know

763
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,800
of their company.

764
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,400
It's really hard for Second Uncle.

765
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,840
He has so many

766
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,960
with so many projects.

767
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,239
It's hard to avoid being distracted.

768
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,079
It's normal.

769
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,039
How about this?

770
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,920
I will reconsider

771
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
I'll reconsider it.

772
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,320
To the greatest extent...

773
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,840
To the greatest extent,

774
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,280
to ease Second Uncle's burden.

775
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,039
What are you watching?

776
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,760
Let's go then.

777
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,159
Congratulations on your complete victory.

778
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,519
Look at the look on your Second Uncle's face.

779
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,000
It's so refreshing!

780
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,000
Book a table for me.

781
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,239
Treating someone to a meal is good.

782
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,440
I know a newly-opened

783
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,199
a newly-opened restaurant recently.

784
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,360
It's said that the environment is romantic.

785
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,599
It's a perfect dining setting for couples.

786
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,719
You talked too much today.

787
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,599
Quickly.

788
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,599
Mr. Mu,

789
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,440
this is Fang Xie.

790
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,400
Little Su is rushing for an announcement.

791
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,840
I'll reply to you on her behalf.

792
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,119
She doesn't have time today.

793
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,360
To have dinner with you.

794
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Not only that,

795
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,000
the time Little Su

796
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,599
Is full.

797
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,599
So...

798
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,599
Mr. Mu.

799
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,480
The restaurant is booked.

800
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,599
Cancel it.

801
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
I confirmed with Fang Jie last week.

802
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
Their schedule isn't that full.

803
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,079
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

804
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,840
Actually, having a relationship

805
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,320
talking about a relationship is like negotiating a business.

806
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
You can't push too hard.

807
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,719
If you push too hard,

808
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,719
you may scare the other party away.

809
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,840
The best solution

810
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,079
one step back today for two steps forward tomorrow

811
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,559
I pushed too hard.

812
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,079
It's not true.

813
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,000
Come on.

814
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,000
What on earth

815
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
with the two of you now?

816
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,000
Why do you have to turn to me

817
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,400
to refuse a meal?

818
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,239
I remember you promised me

819
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,559
you promised me

820
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,559
you would help me

821
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,079
all kinds of troubles for me.

822
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,000
You two

823
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,400
something is fishy.

824
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,079
Tell me the truth.

825
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,119
What's your relationship

826
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,119
between you two now?

827
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,239
Never mind

828
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,880
It won't be related anymore.

829
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,199
Then this is nothing.

830
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,719
Since you've been living with Mr. Mu,

831
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,119
this is getting weird

832
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,480
It's getting weirder by the day.

833
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,039
You can fall asleep right away.

834
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,599
You can't sleep for several days straight.

835
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,920
You're an eagle.

836
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,079
Your skin will become

837
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,960
your skin will deteriorate.

838
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,280
When it's on camera,

839
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,400
on camera.

840
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,159
It will be another mess

841
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,760
of nonsense.

842
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,559
Hearsay

843
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,840
that's right.

844
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
You are actually right.

845
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,199
We can't keep doing this.

846
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,360
Tonight, I'm going to

847
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,639
tonight.

848
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,280
About what?

849
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,440
I'll ask him to move out tomorrow.

850
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,159
That's not possible.

851
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,039
Little Su.

852
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,840
Ask Mr. Mu to move out

853
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
tomorrow.

854
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,800
What does that mean?

855
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,039
Are there anything

856
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,159
hiding something from me?

857
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,360
That Xiao Xia

858
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,639
actually,

859
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,679
I know.

860
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,440
You must be arguing with Mr. Mu.

861
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,079
That's why you said those harsh words.

862
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,159
Are you two

863
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,119
breaking up now?

864
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,159
That's right.

865
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:00,960
We're really

866
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
we're fighting.

867
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:02,760
However,

868
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,719
I haven't had the relationship

869
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,800
to break up.

870
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,840
Weren't I still

871
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,039
with Fang Jie just now?

872
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm going to talk to him

873
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,239
tonight.

874
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,440
Don't worry.

875
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,079
Don't worry.

876
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,719
I have to deal with the first party

877
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,280
and comfort Xia.

878
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
When can we finish this?

879
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,159
Whatever I do, I push too hard.

880
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,480
Are you sleeping, Aunt Hua?

881
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,400
Hey.

882
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,639
I have something to tell you.

883
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
You first.

884
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,400
You first.

885
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,519
Are you

886
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,880
are you avoiding me on purpose?

887
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,480
Did you do that?

888
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,880
Because of the kiss,

889
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,000
what if it is?

890
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,920
You don't have to be so nervous.

891
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,440
The recent invitations

892
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,000
are just normal business days.

893
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,119
No offense.

894
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,400
It's great to cooperate with you.

895
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
A kiss will not

896
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:31,920
break our current

897
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,119
from now on.

898
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,480
Since that's Mr. Mu's idea,

899
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,760
that will be great.

900
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,880
We are both adults.

901
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,800
Yes, it was just a kiss.

902
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
Don't bother about it.

903
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,000
Then we're even.

904
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,000
You really think so?

905
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,440
Certainly.

906
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,239
Everyone is happy.

907
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,159
Therefore,

908
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:58,760
mr. Mu, when are you

909
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,559
move out?

910
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
You're tired today.

911
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,440
Let's talk another day.

912
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,119
It's just a kiss.

913
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,679
There's no need to rest assured.

914
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,719
You still chase me away?

915
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,519
Xiaojin, I'm going back.

916
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,480
Breakfast is on the table.

917
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,639
Remember to eat them.

918
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,519
And the salty soy milk

919
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,440
that you like.

920
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,559
I put it in the refrigerator.

921
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,199
Don't listen to Fang Xie and the others.

922
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:16,199
It only eats those unhealthy vegetables.

923
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,800
Your work is more important.

924
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,000
But our health

925
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,800
more important.

926
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,559
Come on.

927
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,159
Just go.

928
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,199
Isn't it good?

929
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,280
You are at ease again.
