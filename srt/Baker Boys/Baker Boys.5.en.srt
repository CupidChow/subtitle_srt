00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,600
I am looking great today.

2
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,359
Krating, you are such a…

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,740
Young Master, are you okay?

4
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,140
Are you okay, Young Master?

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,479
I’m not okay because of you.

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,340
Why the hell does he look so happy?

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,579
Good morning, Boss.

8
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,460
Morning.

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,060
But you need to do the hand gesture.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,359
Young Master,

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,359
Weir made fried eggs for us.

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,719
So we don’t have to worry about setting a fire.

13
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,120
Bon appetite.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,000
I made this with my heart.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
I knew that. Your gesture made it very obvious.

16
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,640
Let me go.

17
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,180
This is the price for kissing me on the cheek.

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,540
What?! Why did you do that, Boss?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,599
You are driving crazy.

20
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,659
You are crazy and weird. Don’t you know that?

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,959
Do you want to have my kick as your breakfast?

22
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,000
Young Master, please calm down.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,840
Krating, please stop it.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,099
Young Master, calm down.

25
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,879
Let me go.

26
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,500
You can’t kick me.

27
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,879
Boss, stop fighting.

28
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,480
Krating, please stop it.

SWEETNESS THAT IS NOT SO SWEET.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,780
Uncle, what’s going on?

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,360
Why are there so many people?

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,039
It must be because of this.

40
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,840
They come to the café because of us.

41
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,180
Weir,

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,860
if you win the competition, more people will come to our café.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,800
In the future, we can expand our business by selling the franchise.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,500
Our brand will be available across the country.

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,500
Our café will be famous. I’ll be famous.

46
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,960
Girls from across the country will know me.

47
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,599
You will become famous.

48
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,759
There he is.

49
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,500
Krating, this is for you.

50
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,460
Me? Thank you.

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,000
Krating, can you give me an autograph?

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,599
I’ve been your fan for many years.

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,639
An autograph? What should I do, Uncle?

54
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,379
Just write your name down.

55
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,379
Sure.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,080
Krating, can you take a photo with me?

57
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,680
Sure.

58
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,300
Are you Chef Weir?

59
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,039
Can you give me your autograph?

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,620
Please give me your autograph.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,740
Can you take a photo with me?

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,180
Please, I’m begging you.

63
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,500
Weir.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,100
Wait.

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,019
Chef!

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,300
Stop! You can’t go in.

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,540
Hello, I’m from the Today Topic website.

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,779
I want to interview you about the story that you’ve hired Krating,

69
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,959
a former boxer, as a chef assistant.

70
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,759
How did you know that?

71
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,000
Phueak Nae page published Krating’s story a few days ago.

72
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,819
Did you talk about me in the interview?

73
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,459
You didn’t mention the café’s owner?

74
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,120
No.

75
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,899
It’s unbelievable that Mone and Phueak Nae page can make our café become wildly known this fast.

76
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,139
If I know this, I wouldn’t have said no to her.

77
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,279
This is good but I think it’s too much.

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,420
I can’t take it anymore.

79
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,579
What is wrong with you two?

80
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,860
I don’t like that girls are staring at me.

81
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,160
Please wait a moment.

82
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes.

83
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:41,959
Check, please.

84
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,399
We have a special promotion.

85
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,100
If you take a photo with me and check in our café on social media, you will get a 10% discount.

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,060
That’s okay. I’ll pay the bill.

87
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:53,720
Sure.

88
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,199
Everyone,

89
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,839
don’t forget to tune into Sweetest Shop.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,139
Our Sweet Day café has advanced to the final round.

91
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,339
I would like to invite you to go to the show and cheer on us.

92
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,339
If you do so, I’ll offer you a 50% discount.

93
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,500
Please enjoy your dessert.

94
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,339
But don’t forget to take a photo and check into our café.

95
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,160
Please take a look at our menu.

96
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,040
You need to wait a bit. Today, we have many customers.

97
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,660
I want to visit the café but there are so many customers.

98
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,660
I guess we won’t be able to get a table.

99
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,319
We usually did news covers to expose scandals.

100
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,019
It’s nice to do a news cover to help people. Don’t you think, honey?

101
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,579
I agree.

102
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,980
What’s going on? Why are you smiling so brightly?

103
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:07,120
Tell me,

104
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,740
do you like the chef or the chef assistant?

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,439
Dad! Why would I like the chef assistant?

106
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,839
No way!

107
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,100
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,240
From your high voice, it’s definitely true.

109
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,100
If you lowered your pitch a bit, we would have believed you.

110
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,240
I’m here for work, to investigate the crime.

111
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,600
Here is the menu.

112
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,699
Is this your first visit?

113
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,759
Someone who is as pretty as you,

114
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,399
I would have remembered.

115
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,720
I visited the café once when I was young.

116
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,379
At the time, it was run by the old owner.

117
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,240
I think it was around 20 years ago.

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,579
Really?

119
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,800
20 years ago,

120
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,420
did you meet a boy named Punn at this café?

121
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,699
No. Why?

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,339
Nothing.

123
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,080
Pooh,

124
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,279
did something happen to Boss?

125
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,159
Why is he looking stressed?

126
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,080
Is it because of the female customer he met earlier?

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,440
What is going on?

128
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:18,799
He decided to buy this café because he wants to search for his first love whom he met here 20 years ago.

129
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,000
His first love?

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,419
If it was 20 years ago,

131
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,940
he was around 10 years old.

132
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,480
So he was in Grade 5?

133
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,460
Boss is a romantic person.

134
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,460
After that, he has never met his first love again?

135
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,980
What happened?

136
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,340
He lost his first love,

137
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,340
because,

138
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,159
he was abducted by a psychopath.

139
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,080
I’ll have these two.

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
Alright. Please wait a moment.

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Sure.

142
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,019
Here it is.

143
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,019
Hi, honey.

144
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,639
Strawberry cake already sold out?

145
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
The other day, you told me that you would save some for me?

146
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,519
I’m sorry. Next time, I’ll save two pieces for you.

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,259
Here, I’ll give it to you.

148
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,259
Don’t you want to eat it?

149
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,039
I can eat it next time.

150
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,480
Thank you.

151
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,179
I’m Punn. What’s your name?

152
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,960
You’ve told me yet.

153
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,460
Come to meet me here tomorrow.

154
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,100
Then, I’ll tell you my name.

155
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,960
I’ll buy you the cake. Okay?

156
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,000
Aunt, do you see the girl in the pink dress who came in yesterday?

157
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
I haven’t seen her coming in today.

158
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,460
Young Master, should we go out and play while waiting for her?

159
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,580
Sure.

160
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:22,620
Let’s go.

161
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,740
Here you go.

162
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
I lost, Pooh.

163
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,240
I’m sorry.

164
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,919
I need to go to the restroom. Can you wait for me here?

165
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,919
I’ll be right back.

166
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,379
I’m sorry. I thought you’re someone else.

167
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,980
Why is she here yet?

168
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,059
Help me!

169
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,039
Help me!

170
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,519
Help me!

171
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,259
Young Master, I’m here.

172
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,320
Help me! Please help me.

173
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Young Master, please calm down.

174
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,500
No! Don’t!

175
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,840
I’m here, Young Master.

176
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,299
Breathe.

177
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,259
I’m not okay.

178
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,179
It happened when he was 10.

179
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,000
He was abducted.

180
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,879
Luckily, he returned safely.

181
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,879
But ever since,

182
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,059
he has been suffering from nightmares and he can’t eat dessert anymore.

183
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,320
Why?

184
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,340
During the five days that he was abducted,

185
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,940
his abductor forced him to eat cakes

186
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:44,399
every day.

187
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,259
So he was afraid of dessert ever since.

188
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,759
That’s why he can’t eat desserts.

189
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,259
I can’t believe something like that had happened to him.

190
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:01,360
Until today,

191
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,539
he still can’t remember what happened on that day.

192
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,679
He can’t tell who his abductor was or if he was still at large.

193
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,179
It was all my fault.

194
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,899
If I didn’t leave him alone that day,

195
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,419
it wouldn’t have happened.

196
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,419
From that day,

197
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,659
I’d promised myself that I would never let him be alone again.

198
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,379
Uncle, it was not your fault.

199
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,980
You just went to a restroom.

200
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,159
It was his abductor’s fault.

201
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,100
That’s right, Pooh. Don’t blame yourself for it.

202
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,779
If he knows, he must be sad.

203
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,440
Really?

204
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,039
I didn’t mean to.

205
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,399
I just want to protect him.

206
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,899
Uncle, calm down. Chef just wanted to comfort you.

207
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,000
He is lucky to have you as his bodyguard.

208
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,100
No,

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,820
I’m the one who is lucky to have a chance to be his bodyguard.

210
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,059
You must really love him.

211
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,759
Yes.

212
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
But I want to be able to help him more.

213
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,480
For all these times, I can barely help him.

214
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,399
That’s alright. I’ll find a way to help him too.

215
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,559
I believe if we work together,

216
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,940
we can help him get better.

217
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,759
Thank you.

218
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,940
Let’s work together.

219
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,500
Me too?

220
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,180
Sure.

221
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,019
Yeah!

222
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,799
Boss, your breakfast is ready.

223
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,140
Why are you eating rice but my breakfast is porridge?

224
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,539
When I had a nightmare,

225
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,460
I usually had porridge with ginger for breakfast.

226
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,400
It helps comfort me. So I want to make you one.

227
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,579
I thought I might help you feel better.

228
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,339
Did you tell them?

229
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,799
I’m sorry.

230
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,579
It’s good that they know.

231
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,759
So they will stop forcing me to eat desserts.

232
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,000
Uncle, can I ask you something?

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,059
Do you really open the café to find your first love?

234
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,539
I don’t believe it.

235
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,799
You punk!

236
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,400
How can you do that?

237
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I also want to know what your face is made from.

238
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,259
Are you scolding me that my face is clear, smooth, and soft?

239
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,259
Is that considering a scold?

240
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,599
What can I do? I was born perfect and handsome.

241
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,940
Today, I’ll post my photo and check into our café again.

242
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,680
How is it? I’m copying you.

243
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,019
No. My action looks more tasteful.

244
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,019
The taste that girls run away from?

245
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,019
Stop it. Stop fighting.

246
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:50,339
Can you tell us if it’s true that you open the café to find your first love?

247
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,660
I just want to meet her one more time.

248
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,119
If our café is popular,

249
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,480
I may have that chance.

250
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,480
One more thing,

251
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,460
I want to overcome my fear and be able to enjoy desserts like others once again.

252
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,140
But I haven’t been able to do either of them.

253
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,779
That’s so romantic.

254
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,599
I’ll help you.

255
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,039
I’ll lead the Sweet Day to win the Sweetest Shop contest.

256
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:28,079
So one day, your first love will come to see you.

257
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,200
Weir, you are such a good person.

258
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,960
Please help him.

259
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,079
Krating, hurry have your breakfast. So we can go practice.

260
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,819
Yes, Chef. If it’s about winning the contest, I’ll do my best.

261
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,460
If you win the contest,

262
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,819
I’ll give you a 12-month bonus.

263
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,119
But right now,

264
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,079
I’m cutting your salary for 12 months.

265
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,319
Let’s eat.

266
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,960
Did you find new information about the children murders that you are investigating?

267
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,259
No at all.

268
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,240
There is no evidence nor the suspect.

269
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,480
Police also do not pay much attention to the case.

270
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,839
Should we do a cover story about the police’s slow investigation?

271
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:42,980
I think it’s not the time to pressure police who are working on this case yet.

272
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,960
We need to admit that these are tough cases since they have no evidence.

273
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,240
Most of the victims are children that the public pays no attention to.

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,240
We have no evidence or clue to link these cases to other child missing cases.

275
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,900
The culprit was very thorough.

276
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:08,099
What should we do next?

277
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,000
I think we should focus on this.

278
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,799
My future son-in-law is competing in the Sweetest Shop contest,

279
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,380
we should go there and cheer him on.

280
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,359
Mom, I told you not to tease me too much about it.

281
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,940
Don’t you want to go and cheer him on?

282
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:31,440
Yes.

283
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,680
He has advanced into the final round, I should go to cheer him on.

284
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,079
Take it easy.

285
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Chef Weir’s competitor looks familiar. It’s like I have met her before.

286
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,720
It’s Chef Roong from the Old Butter. Don’t you remember her?

287
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:00,700
The Old Butter? It sounds familiar.

288
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,640
The Old Butter? It sounds familiar.

289
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,220
The Old Butter is owned by Nim.

290
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,599
She was the only one who escaped from being prosecuted for selling facial cream with mercury.

291
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,619
It was the case that we investigated last year.

292
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,259
We had concrete evidence to link her to the case but she still escaped from being prosecuted.

293
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,960
This country, if you have money and power, you will escape from prison.

294
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,240
Our country’s law is weak.

295
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,880
I brought this up is not because I want to tease you.

296
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,319
But I think…

297
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,099
You think that this competition is fishy, isn’t it?

298
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,720
Isn’t this a bit too much?

299
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,160
What do you mean?

300
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,799
I close the café today to cheer you on. Isn’t it a good thing?

301
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,880
This is the final round.

302
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,559
I’m here to cheer Weir and Krating on.

303
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,539
I mean this is too much, don’t you think?

304
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:20,500
This?

305
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,720
I ordered it especially for you.

306
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Initially, I want it to be brighter but this is brightest as it can be.

307
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,759
If you want it to be brighter, you will need spotlight bulbs.

308
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:42,500
Please go standby at your position.

309
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,319
Yes.

310
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,000
Fight on.

311
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,400
I promise that I’ll win the championship so that our Sweet Day café becomes famous.

312
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,920
So your first love will find you.

313
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,619
Fight on.

314
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,500
I’ll be right back.

315
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,380
Producer,

316
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:31,259
Nim is worried about what we have discussed earlier.

317
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,400
It’s not easy for me to do what you have told me.

318
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,460
The other team is quite good.

319
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:43,480
The topic is the same one we have agreed on?

320
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,779
Yes, it’s what we have agreed on.

321
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,200
It’s the dessert that the Old Butter is famous for.

322
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,700
We have arranged all the ingredients you need.

323
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,039
Thank you.

324
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,720
This is the special bonus that Nim gives to you.

325
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,640
It’s time to reveal the topic for the final round.

326
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,460
Today’s topic is…

327
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,559
A non-sweet cake.

328
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:34,160
In other words, a cake that did not use sugar as an ingredient.

329
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,920
Young Master, what is a non-sweet cake?

330
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,220
I don’t know but Weir looks surprised.

331
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:49,960
The contestants need to adapt their recipe to create a no-sugar cake that tastes like a regular cake.

332
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,619
The team with the best result will win the title of this year’s Sweetest Shop.

333
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,779
Now both teams have known the topic.

334
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,500
I think they both are ready.

335
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,299
Start.

336
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,380
Chef, what cake should we make?

337
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,200
Krating,

338
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,420
why would someone want to eat a non-sweet cake?

339
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,099
Isn’t it because they don’t want to gain weight?

340
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,319
I have an idea what cake should we make.

341
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,019
I will make a cake that does not use flour and sugar as ingredients.

342
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,700
If we don’t use flour, how can we make a cake?

343
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,839
Will Weir be able to make it?

344
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,140
He can. He is talented.

345
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,680
The other team is also talented.

346
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,440
Weir is talented too.

347
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,559
We will make a honey cream cheese coconut cake that has coconut as its main ingredient.

348
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,920
The most important thing about a healthy cake is that it should contain low carbohydrates and sugar.

349
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,200
So we will use coconut and almond flours instead of cake flour,

350
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,420
Use coconut milk instead of cow milk which has high carbohydrates.

351
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Use honey as a source of sweetness instead of sugar.

352
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,240
Fight on!

353
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:25,380
Only three minutes left for both teams.

354
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,140
They need to hurry up.

355
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,140
What is the Sweet Day team doing?

356
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,039
The Old Butter is also speeding up.

357
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,779
Will they make it in time?

358
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,119
They will.

359
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,500
Only two minutes left.

360
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,880
The Old Butter is done.

361
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,420
Let see if the Sweet Day will make it in time.

362
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,799
Why does the other team finish so fast?

363
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,160
I don’t know.

364
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Weir, will you make it in time?

365
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,339
Chef, we are running out of time.

366
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,960
Only one minute left.

367
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Please hurry up.

368
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,200
Three

369
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,200
Two

370
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,720
One. Time’s up. Please stop.

371
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,720
I really like your strawberry banana cake.

372
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,359
Its taste and quality are good even though you didn’t use any sugar.

373
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,160
Thank you the staff for preparing great ingredients for us.

374
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,119
So we can make a tasty cake without using any sugar.

375
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,039
The decoration is interesting. It makes the cake look tasty.

376
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,599
Although you didn’t use any sugar, it still looks sweet and yummy.

377
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,519
I think this is a famous cake of the Old Butter, isn’t it?

378
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,200
Yes, I had tried it at the café. It was really good.

379
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,460
We have upgraded the decoration a bit today.

380
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,279
We are lucky that today’s topic matches our famous recipe.

381
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Let’s taste the next cake.

382
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,220
Did you use coconut flour?

383
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,680
Yes, we used coconut flour mixed with almond flour.

384
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,259
The ingredients are those used for making a diet cake.

385
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,180
But today’s topic is no-sugar cake.

386
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,559
Didn’t you go too far from the topic?

387
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,279
We decided to make the honey cream cheese coconut cake for those who want to eat cake but don’t want to consume sugar.

388
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:43,599
They might have health issues such as trying to lose weight or diabetes.

389
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,900
So they cannot consume sugar like normal.

390
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:54,220
We make this no-sugar cake so that they can enjoy cake and sweetness in a different way.

391
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,920
This is non-sweet sweetness, just like the topic we have received.

392
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:01,339
Not only the taste is good but it’s also good for health.

393
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,339
I like your idea.

394
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,900
Your priority is your customer’s need.

395
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,900
The decoration look as good as the Old Butter’s.

396
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,380
This is going to be a tough decision.

397
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,980
They both have their own charms.

398
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:26,079
Now is time for the judges to decide who will be the winner of this year’s Sweetest Shop contest.

399
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,079
Will it be the Old Butter?

400
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,880
Or will it be the Sweet Day?

401
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,240
Chef, do you think we will win this?

402
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,779
Yes, I think we will win. I’m confident.

403
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,980
Now is the time we all are waiting for.

404
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:57,019
The winner of the Sweetest Day Season 3 is…

405
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,880
Chef Roong from the Old Butter. Congratulations!

406
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,799
Thank you.

407
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,579
Phueak Nae team, I got something.

408
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,400
Pooh.

409
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:25,900
Yes, Young Master.

410
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:27,860
What’s going on?

411
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,500
I don’t know.

412
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,760
I saw them sitting here for a while. So I joined them.

413
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,179
We lost.

414
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,940
This is the first time that I lost.

415
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,239
I’m sorry that I couldn’t win the contest as I’d promised.

416
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,159
Look at me.

417
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,880
Do you see any anger or resentment on my face?

418
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,219
So why are you sad?

419
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:20,800
But…what about the café?

420
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,360
The one who will judge our café is the customers.

421
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:28,639
If our café is good,

422
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,940
they will visit our café although we didn’t join the contest.

423
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,840
What are we going to do about the problem that we don’t have many customers?

424
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,039
Just let it go.

425
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,480
There’s nothing we can do.

426
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:44,940
Is it that simple?

427
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,940
We did our best.

428
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,360
Let wait for the fruit of our effort.

429
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:00,280
Good talk. I like it.

430
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,760
I have an idea for our café’s new dessert.

431
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:11,920
The recipe that you made in the show. We should sell it in a form of a cupcake.

432
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,199
What do you think?

433
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:17,199
What about your first love?

434
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:22,420
I was on television. If she sees me, she will recognize me.

435
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,579
But if she didn’t see or recognize me,

436
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,199
there’s nothing I can do about it.

437
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,500
There are things beyond our control.

438
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,739
But they always have their way out.

439
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,519
Why does he look so handsome today?

440
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,980
I’m always like this.

441
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,980
Handsome but weird.

442
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,119
I’m not surprised why girls always run away from you.

443
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,239
What should I do about the 12-month bonus?

444
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:01,800
The girls who don’t choose you, it is their loss.

445
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,059
Tell me if any girl refuses your love, I’ll accept the love myself.

446
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,039
Give me a kiss.

447
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,099
Stay away from me.

448
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,099
What’s wrong with you?

449
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,460
Uncle, we have a problem at the café.

450
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,880
What’s going on?

451
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,099
Young Master, what’s wrong?

452
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,099
Did you get hurt? Are you okay?

453
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,059
What’s wrong with him?

454
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,119
Krating, what’s wrong?

455
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,179
Phueak Nae page exposed that the Old butter gave a bribe to the producer.

456
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,320
They won because they knew the topic of the final round in advance and the result was predetermined.

457
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,500
This means that the winner is…

458
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,860
Our Sweet Day café. We won.

459
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,940
I’ve told you to let things be.

460
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,639
The fruit of our effort would show.

461
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,179
See? My way of thinking was great, wasn’t it?

462
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,860
Amazing.

463
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,340
But I think you should stop looking cool.

464
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,500
Why?

465
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,900
You are topless. That makes my heart race.

466
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,320
Why did you have to bite your lip?

467
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:43,900
We are the winner. Aren’t we going to celebrate it?

468
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,619
Chef Weir, can we interview you?

469
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,679
How do you feel that the Old Butter unfairly stole your victory?

470
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:15,159
Chef Weir, what will you do with the Old Butter and the show?

471
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,579
I am…

472
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,079
I don’t know.

473
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,820
Excuse me.

474
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,800
As the café’s owner, I will answer the questions.

475
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,480
Whether we win the contest or not,

476
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,119
we are always determined to make tasty and quality cakes to make our customers happy.

477
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,039
We don’t need any prize or championship to guarantee that.

478
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,840
For the two female reporters, our café has a new dessert.

479
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,920
This is honey cream cheese coconut cake.

480
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,280
I want you to try it.

481
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,239
But I have one condition, you must take a photo with me and check into our café on social media.

482
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,659
They said that if you visit Osaka, you need to check into the Glico Man sign.

483
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,820
If you visit Seoul, you have to check into Namsan Tower.

484
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:12,860
If you visit our Sweet Day café, you need to check in with me.

485
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,000
What?

486
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,840
Wait here.

487
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,579
I made a non-sweet Café Liégeois for you.

488
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,579
Please try it.

489
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,079
You knew that I can’t eat desserts.

490
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,039
Think of it as a challenge that you need to overcome.

491
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,500
I know that you used to love desserts.

492
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,179
Yes, but I can’t eat it anymore.

493
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:02,679
But you haven’t given it a try.

494
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,980
I know that you can’t eat dessert because of the abduction.

495
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,320
But now you are the owner of a dessert café.

496
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,440
It’s weird if you don’t eat dessert.

497
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,659
But if I eat it and then I vomit, I feel bad for the cake.

498
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,880
That’s why I made the non-sweet cake for you.

499
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,739
Give it a try.

500
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:35,599
Maybe your effort may pay off.

501
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,519
Please.

502
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,519
Please.

503
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,420
Okay, I got it.

504
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,099
But just one bite.

505
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,119
Before you eat it, you should add this.

506
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,139
It makes the dessert tastier and adds milk fragrant which goes well with the Café Liégeois.

507
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,400
How is it? Is it edible?

508
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,559
It’s tasty.

509
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,139
It has creamy milk fragrant but it’s not too sweet. It’s delicious.

510
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,619
It’s delicious.

511
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,460
See? This is the fruit of your effort.

512
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:21,659
One day, you will be able to eat dessert again.

513
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,039
I promise.

514
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,960
But you need to put work hard together with me.

515
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:32,340
Thank you.

516
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:43,780
One day, you will no longer have nightmares but you will dream of me.

517
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,780
Crazy.

518
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Your flick is strong.

519
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:59,400
You deserve it.

520
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,320
Eat it. Eat a lot.

521
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:22,179
That’s my boy.

522
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:39,820
What?

523
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,619
You want to eat an orange cake?

524
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,119
I’ll go out to buy it tomorrow.

525
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,480
Please stop it.

526
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,320
Do you feel lonely?

527
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:00,340
I’ll bring a friend to play with you.

528
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,880
I’ll catch a new friend for you.

529
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,480
What did you say, Tert?

530
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,920
We need to find a friend for our son.

531
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,519
Eat it. Eat a lot.

532
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,639
That’s my boy.

533
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,440
The murderer must be living near the exercise ground.

534
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,500
That includes the Sweet Day café.

535
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,400
Leave me alone.

536
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,400
Our son must be happiest.

537
00:45:57,699 --> 00:46:00,920
He gave me a dessert?

538
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,940
Who gave you the dessert?

539
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:02,980
What dessert?

540
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,159
Mee Pooh.

541
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:07,800
Since when did Pooh have a girlfriend? Why didn’t I know about it?

542
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,579
A high school girl and a 35-year-old man?

543
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,219
He is dating a girl.
