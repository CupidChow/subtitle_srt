Well,

Young Master saw the guy who kidnapped him 20 years ago.

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,509
He came to the café today.

70
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,400

00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,810
I’m sorry, Young Master.

00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,750
Young Master.

75
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,920
We should do something.

76
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,720
Otherwise, Boss could get worse.

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,370

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,240

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,389
Hey,

80
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,550
I said I’m not going. I want to stay home.

81
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,970
A morning workout can make you feel better.

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,639
Exactly.

83
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,569
I want to stay home.

84
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,680
Young Master, don’t worry.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,779
We will all take care of you.

00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,839

00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,310
For what?

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,100
We should stay alert.

92
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,800
Young Master, watch out!

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,639
Stop it.

00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,250
You two, as well.

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,759
What’s wrong with you?

96
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,168
It’s good to stay alert.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,495
If something happens, I will punch him in the face.

98
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:31,696
Enough already.

99
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:34,240
It’s embarrassing for people to see us like this.

100
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:38,672
There’s no one else around here.

101
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,615

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,848

Don’t smile at meand don’t give me those eyes.

109
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,615
and don’t give me those eyes.

110
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,175
I’m not that weak.

111
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,000
Don’t pity me.

112
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,375
I’m not.

113
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,120
I’m worried about you.

114
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,855
Don’t be.

115
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,519
I can take care of myself.

116
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:13,567
Let’s go, Young Master.

117
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,759
Why did you stop, Uncle?

118
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,471
What is it, Boss?

119
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,351
Boss.

You’re okay, right?

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,735
Yeah, I’m fine.

122
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:13,959
I wasn’t asking you.

123
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,290
I was asking Chef.

124

I was asking Chef.You’re okay, right?

125
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,767
You’re okay, right?

Hey, it’s my first time seeing a body too.

128
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:24,927
I shouldn’t have told you about this incident.

129
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,144
Oh, come on, sulking boy.

Are you alright, Mr. Punn?

131
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,327
Young Master is still in shock.

132
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,048
It must be him.

133
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,779
It must be him.

134
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:40,783
It must be him.Who are you talking about?

135
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:41,728
Who are you talking about?

136
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,247
The guy who kidnapped me.

137
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:49,879
I saw him at the café yesterday.

138
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:49,887
I saw him at the café yesterday.You saw Mr. Tert?

139
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,127
You saw Mr. Tert?

140
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:53,807
You know him?

141
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,000
How did you know him?

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,759

00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,327
Now please change your pose.

160
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,139
Okay.

161
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,144
Okay.Let’s take a break here.

162
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,495
Let’s take a break here.

163
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,775
Okay.

164
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,991
How are you? Are you tired?

165
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:48,511
No.

166
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,087
Mom, I want to eat rhubarb tart again.

167
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,783
Eating too much sweets is not good for you.

168
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:06,943
You won’t look as pretty

169
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,624
and you could get cavities.

170
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,488
But I want to eat it.

171
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:13,984
You can’t.

172
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,744
Please wait here.

173
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:17,740
I’ll go get something else for you.

174
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,255
Alright.

175
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:45,296
Nana?

176
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,408
My baby.

177
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,447
A boy was found dead?

178
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes.

179
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,624
I think the murderer is nearby

180
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:12,032
and probably the same person who kidnapped Mesa.

181
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,648
This area is not safe for the kids anymore.

182
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:17,504
Not even our school.

183
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:21,327
Then we must look after them better.

184
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,799
Yes.

185
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:25,984
I guess the school can’t do much to help.

186
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:29,231
We as teachers have to protect the kids as best as we can.

187
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:33,008
I don’t want to see any more kids become a victim.

188
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:37,936
Guys,
big news!

189
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,823
What happened, Baby Pig?

190
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,399
She disappeared out of the blue while at work.

191
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,192
Nana, the kid actress?

192
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,248
Did that sweet murderer kidnap her?

193
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,279
I think we should close early today

194
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:01,135
so Pooh can send Piglet home.

195
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,792
Krating and I will go home to check on Boss.

196
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,823
Okay.

197
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,432
Any updates on the missing kid actress?

198
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,240
Not yet.

199
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,423
This time the kidnapper’s approach was very outrageous.

200
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,210
He probably wanted to make headlines by kidnapping the kid actress.

201
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:31,216
He probably wanted to make headlines by kidnapping the kid actress.It looks like the police haven't gotten anything yet.

202
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,327
It looks like the police haven't gotten anything yet.

203
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,272
They must be busy.

204
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:38,735
Look at Lieutenant Sompong.

205
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,528
I can see his frustrated face from here.

206
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:41,899
Hello, Lieutenant Sompong.

207
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:41,903
Hello, Lieutenant Sompong.Hi.

208
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:42,607
Hi.

209
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you for coming.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,008
Thank you for coming.I didn’t want to come,

211
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,495
I didn’t want to come,

212
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:51,183
but you guys kept texting me every five minutes and I couldn’t get anything done.

213
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:56,110
You’re interfering with the authority’s work.

214
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,111
You’re interfering with the authority’s work.Oh, come on.

215
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,135
Oh, come on.

216
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,129
You come every time.

217
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,200
What do you want this time?

218
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:06,847
We want to know the results of the autopsy.

219
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:08,840
Did you find anything particularly suspicious?

220
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:13,967
How many times have I told you that I can’t tell you anything?

221
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,344
It’s against the rules.

222
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,340
I could get in trouble.

223
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,039
Come on, Lieutenant.

224
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:21,168
Please help us.

225
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:22,879
It will be a win-win.

226
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:26,655
We’re just exchanging helpful information,

227
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:27,648
right?

228
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,480
This family is the worst.

229
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,984
The kid ate a sweet that contains barb or something.

230
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,631
I can’t remember the name.

231
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,129
Is it rhubarb?

232
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes, that’s the name.

233
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:49,659
We found a sweet that contains barb near the scene

234
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,039
where the kid actress went missing.

235
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,231
I don’t know.

236
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,870
I didn’t tell you anything.

237
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:57,871
I didn’t tell you anything.You didn’t.

238
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,279
You didn’t.

239
00:12:59,279 --> 00:12:59,711
You figured it out yourselves.
You didn’t.

240
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,389
You figured it out yourselves.

241
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,389
Suddenly, it came to mind.

242
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:04,576
I have to go.

243
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,864
Guys,

244
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:19,888
Sweet Day just introduced rhubarb tart as their Valentine’s special.

245
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,967
It’s the only café in this neighborhood that uses rhubarb as an ingredient.

246
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Then there’s a chance the murderer has been to Sweet Day

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,039
and it’s possible that he kidnapped Nana.

248
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,279
But I’m sure it’s not Mr. Tert.

249
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,320
Why are you sure?

250
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,080
My instinct tells me.

251
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:48,176
Anyway, I have to check on something at Sweet Day.

252
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:49,152
What is it?

253
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,176
Uncle is really going to be fine, right?

254
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,744
What happened must have triggered his wound.

255
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,111
He will need some time.

256
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:13,535
Do you think the murderer is the same guy who kidnapped Uncle?

257
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:16,831
I don’t know anything.

258
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:20,783
I think no one will until they catch the murderer.

259
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,120
I don’t want to see Young Master in pain again.

260
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,727
I feel sorry for him.

261
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,048
Hi.

262
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:37,230
Is Mr. Punn here?

263
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,416
Is something wrong, Mr. Pooh?

264
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,744
No, I’m fine.

265
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,370
Do you need anything?

266
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:49,375
Do you need anything?Young Master is off today.

267
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,591
Young Master is off today.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,759
I’d like to check your CCTV footage.

269
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:59,087
It’s possible that the murderer has come to buy cake here.

270
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,399
Why do you think so?

271
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:07,552
The autopsy results of the kid who died in the playground found rhubarb in his stomach.

272
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,104
Besides,

273
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,855
they also found rhubarb tart at the scene where Nana went missing.

274
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:19,583
No other café in this area use rhubarb as a dessert ingredient.

275
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:26,048
Let me call Young Master.

276
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,039
That’d be great, thanks.

277
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:29,711
Please have a seat.

278
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,663
How is Mr. Punn doing?

279
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,032
He’s not feeling better yet.

280
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:43,855
The police is looking for Mr. Tert.

281
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,559
Please tell Mr. Punn not to worry.

282
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:51,375
If there’s more news, I will let you know as soon as possible.

283
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,600
Alright, thank you so much.

284
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,416
Young Master said you can proceed.

285
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,312
Thank you.

286
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,192
Of course.

287
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,847
Have you found anything?

288
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,200
Not yet.

289
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,936
No one seems suspicious.

290
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:23,919
No one is wearing a red hat. Nothing seems unusual.

291
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:30,368
Why didn’t you think Mr. Tert was the sweet murderer?

292
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,351
There’s no definite proof,

293
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,888
but I believe that Mr. Tert is not the sweet murderer.

294
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:49,279
Hi, Mom?

295
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,783
Sure, I’ll be there soon.

296
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,535
I have to go.

297
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,600
May I take this file home? I’ll see if I can find something else.

298
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
Sure, I’ll let Uncle know.

299
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,728
I’m going then.

300
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,503
If the guy who killed the kid is not the same guy who kidnapped Uncle,

301
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,480
who is the real murderer?

302
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:36,400
Mr. Tert went to see Mr. Punn at the café the other day.

303
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,496
What is Tert planning to do?

304
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,423
Why did he go to see that young man again?

305
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,104
Nothing violent happened, right?

306
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,400
Did Tert do anything?

307
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,407
Did Tert do anything?Mr. Punn is safe and sound.

308
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,728
Mr. Punn is safe and sound.

309
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:51,647
Don’t worry.

310
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,663
What about the dead boy in the news?

311
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,288
Have the police caught the murderer yet?

312
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,711
No one thinks my husband did it, right?

313
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:05,920
No one knows yet because the police are still investigating

314
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,023
We don’t think Mr. Tert did it.

315
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:16,799
Oh, Tert, why did you have to disappear?

316
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,256
Mr. Tert.

317
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,503
Tert.

318
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:37,935
Where have you been?

319
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,415
What are you planning to do?

320
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,375
I saw everything.

321
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,112
I saw that boy.

322
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,248
He looked so much like our son.

323
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,711
Tert,

324
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:57,104
did you really kill that boy?

325
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,559
I was just sitting in the playground.

326
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,496
He was standing and looking at the boy.

327
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,544
You saw the murderer, right?

328
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,824
Nuan, our son is gone.

329
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,127
He’s not here anymore.

330
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,599
It’s my fault.	I’m sorry.

331
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,288
It’s my fault.

332
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,311
You went to see Mr. Punn because you wanted to apologize, right?

333
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:05,776
Yes.

334
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,175
I did him wrong.

335
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:14,016
I had to apologize to him.

336
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,336
I shouldn’t have done that to him.

337
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:22,384
But why did you run away from home?

338
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,231
I saw in the news that many kids have been kidnapped.

339
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,375
I was scared they’d be gone like our son.

340
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,592
The kids had to go home

341
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,455
but I couldn’t help them.

342
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,248
I’m useless.

343
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,144
I’m useless.

344
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,167
Don’t lose hope yet.

345
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,695
You still have a chance.

346
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,208
Please go apologize to Mr. Punn again.

347
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,152
Boss, you don’t have to help us.

348
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,039
We can take care of this.

349
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,288
You can go home, Young Master.

350
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:35,680
No, staying home is boring.

351
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,816
What are you doing here?

352
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:02,640
Please leave.

353
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,784
Young Master doesn’t want to talk to you.

354
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,807
Mr. Punn, Mr. Tert just wanted to apologize.

355
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,799
He didn’t come to hurt you.

356
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:12,496
No.

357
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:15,680
Get out.

358
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:21,023
Look, I just want to apologize about that day.

359
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,367
I shouldn’t have done it.

360
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,640
I shouldn’t have done it.

361
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:28,496
Eat.

362
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:37,167
Hey, I shouldn’t have done this.

363
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,407
Listen, you have to forget all of this.

364
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,000
I shouldn’t have done this.

365
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:51,263
Forget all of this.

366
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:52,400
Forget?

367
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,700
Yes. Forget all of this.

368
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:54,703
Yes. Forget all of this.Go home.

369
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:55,776
Go home.

370
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,935
Go!

371
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,672
Go!

372
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,847
Forget?

373
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,329
Forget all of this.

374
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,160
I shouldn’t have done it.

375
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,384
Look,

376
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,943
I’m really sorry.

377
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,650
I shouldn’t have done it.

378
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:18,655
I shouldn’t have done it.Get out!

379
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:19,789
Get out!

380
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:19,791
Get out!I’m really sorry.

381
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,650
I’m really sorry.

382
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:20,655
I’m really sorry.Get out!

383
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:21,420
Get out!

384
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,423
Get out!I said get out!

385
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:22,349
I said get out!

386
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:22,352
I said get out!I don’t want to see your face!

387
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:23,789
I don’t want to see your face!

388
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:23,791
I don’t want to see your face!Forgive me.

389
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:24,940
Forgive me.

390
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:24,943
Forgive me.Get out!

391
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,039
Get out!

392
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,048
Get out!Please.

393
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,319
Please.

394
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:27,327
Please.Tert.

395
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,048
Tert.

396
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:29,791
Get out!

397
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:30,672
Please leave.

398
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,703
I beg you.

399
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,240
Please stop, Tert.

400
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,920
Let’s go.

401
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,288
Let’s go.

402
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,632
I know what I’m going to say won’t make Mr. Tert less guilty

403
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:14,256
but I want you to know that he kidnapped you

404
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:21,215
because he thought you were his missing son.

405
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:25,407
Mr. Tert is suffering from mental illness.

406
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,847
He did what did because he’s sick.

407
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:33,632
So what?

408
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,119
Do I have to forgive a man like him?

409
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:41,455
I know it’s hard to forgive,

410
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:47,824
but do you really want to be stuck in pain for the rest of your life?

411
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,703
But he’s a child murderer.

412
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,339
Mr. Tert is not a murderer.

413
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:55,344
Mr. Tert is not a murderer.If it’s not him, then who?

414
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,655
If it’s not him, then who?

415
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,127
He kidnapped me.

416
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,855
He made me become this way.

417
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,463
I’ve been suffering for almost all my life because of him.

418
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:18,448
I’ll prove that Mr. Tert is innocent.

419
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:21,056
I’ll catch the real murderer.

420
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,064
Young Master!

421
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:35,311
Please come out.

422
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:37,311
Uncle!

423
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,839
Please come out.

424
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,935
Young Master!

425
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,296
It’s not working.

426
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:50,192
He won’t answer, come out, eat, drink or do anything.

427
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,480
I think…

428
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,488
I think…What if he has suicidal thoughts?

429
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:52,912
What if he has suicidal thoughts?

430
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:53,776
I think

431
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,309
we should break in.

432
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:55,311
we should break in.Really?	Okay.

433
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,087
Really?	Okay.

434
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,271
The door is too hard.

435
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:07,728
I can’t break in.

436
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:10,640
I can’t do anything to help him.

437
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,192
Calm down.

438
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:14,190
Don’t blame yourself.

439
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,288
Uncle is a tough guy.

440
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,632
I think maybe Boss wants to be alone right now.

441
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:27,263
Sometimes being alone can make us think of something good.

442
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:28,960
Alright.

443
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:33,728
Let’s go.

444
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:48,943
Boss,

445
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:53,183
we’re always here.

446
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:17,680
Why can’t I figure out anything?

447
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:22,463
Think, Mone, think.

448
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,968
Is there any other evidence?

449
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,864
Is anything else suspicious?

450
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,304
Do you remember what the kidnapper looked like?

451
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:38,640
White hair.

452
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,991
Old.

453
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,990
Old?

454
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,983
Yes. Someone old.

455
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:47,663
The murderer is someone old.

456
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:48,751
Okay.

457
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,319
This woman.

458
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,688
Now there’s only this woman who fits the description.

459
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,135
But could it be her?

460
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
She looks kind.

461
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,071
Let’s see.

462
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:18,031
March 7, 4:32 p.m.

463
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,920
I’ll go find out.

464
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,990
Here you are.

465
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:46,672
Hey, this place is quiet today.

466
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,175
Is it because Mr. Punn is not here?

467
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,847
You’re right. It’s unusually quiet without Boss.

468
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,528
I don’t know when he will go back to being crazy.

469
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,887
I miss Young Master so much, too.

470
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:14,640
Don’t worry, guys

471
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,983
I’m sure in the end he will figure out if he wants to live with the painful past

472
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:25,119
or live with the present in order to be happy in the future.

473
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,392
Did you remember that from a cartoon?

474
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,167
It’s from my own brain, Ting Nong Noy.

475
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,839
I better go.

476
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,455
Pooh, we have a customer.

477
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,112
The usual, please.

478
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
Two pieces of rhubarb tart and one piece of chocolate cake.

479
00:30:01,455 --> 00:30:03,056
Yes, ma’am. I have them ready.

480
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,599
It’ll be just a moment.

481
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,768
Would you like anything else?

482
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,480
Not today.

483
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:12,000
Your usual order, ma’am.

484
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:13,728
Thanks.

485
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,256
One box, right?

486
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,008
Ma’am,

487
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,359
are you alright?

488
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,119
Thanks.

489
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,799
I’m feeling dizzy,

490
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,887
probably from the long walk and this heat.

491
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:55,743
Typical of old people.

492
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:00,192
This is your house, right?

493
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,647
Yes.

494
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:03,471
Let me help.

495
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,271
After you.

496
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,440
Thanks.

497
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:25,440
It’s alright.

498
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:29,407
Can you put the cake inside?

499
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,511
Sure, no problem.

500
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:34,000
Thanks.

501
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,976
Help!

502
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:29,000
Help me get out of here!

503
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,008
Help me get out of here!Help me!

504
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,672
Help me!

505
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,728
Help me!

506
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,432
Here you are.

507
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:41,471
Thanks.

508
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:45,599
By the way, is the guy who always asks people to take a photo and check in not here?

509
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:49,135
Oh, he’s staying home today.

510
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,384
Next time you come, you can check in with him.

511
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,016
I can’t believe I’m saying this,

512
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,023
but I miss Uncle.

513
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,776
Without Young Master asking people to check in,

514
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,271
it doesn’t really feel like our café.

515
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:21,056
Both asking the girls to check in and flirting with them.

516
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:25,920
That crazy buy 1 get 2 free promotion that puts us in the red.

517
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,375
Get a photo with Young Master to get a 50% discount or not pay.

518
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,336
Let’s do something for Boss.

519
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,527
Maybe your fear can be overcome with forgiveness.

520
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:30,735
People who made a mistake in the past but own up to it and try their best to fix it

521
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,840
should be given a second chance.

522
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,496
[Would you like to come take a photo and check in with us?]

523
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,840
These guys.

524
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,152
You two can stay here.

525
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:05,264
I have a home now!

526
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,260
Can I sleep in your room?

527
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:08,269
No way.

528
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:08,271
No way.Why not?

529
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:09,360
Why not?

530
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,391
Can we swap bedrooms, Uncle?

531
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,255
Where’s your room, Boss?

532
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,423
You could’ve just told me you wanted to fight since early morning.You could’ve just told me you wanted to fight since early morning.

533
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,559
Calm down.

534
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,288
Please stop.

535
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,728
You’re a part of Sweet Day.

536
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:31,568
You’re a part of our family.

537
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:35,632
From now on,

538
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,456
you don’t have to feel bad and run anywhere.

539
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:41,744
Understand?

540
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,248
Young Master!

541
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:49,599
Krating!

542
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,311
You’re not fighting alone anymore.

543
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:39,824
You have us.

544
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,983
Boss, we’re always here.

545
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:50,960
Damn.

546
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,456
What am I doing here alone?

547
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:09,615
Young Master.

548
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:11,610
Uncle.

549
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,239
Welcome back.

550
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,416
Did you know how lonely we were without the sound of your nagging?

551
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,079
Please be talkative again.

552
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:25,199
You just gave me a backhanded compliment again.

553
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,536
No, that was a direct insult.

554
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:29,119
Don’t hug me.

555
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,367
Did you come to take a photo and check in with us?

556
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,480
That’s my sentence.

557
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:39,088
If you take a photo and check in now,

558
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:42,719

559
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:46,784
Have a seat, Uncle.

560
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:48,239
Let’s have some dessert.

561
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:49,391
Come on.

562
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,704
Here.

563
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,679
I don’t eat sweets. Why do you guys keep forcing me?

564
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:04,896
This is a very less sweet recipe I made specially for you.

565
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:10,639
Fine.

566
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:35,807
So good.

567
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:39,583
Whoa.

568
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:55,472
Everyone, smile.

569
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,664
You didn’t give me time to pose.

570
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,431
Take a new one.

571
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,807
This one is already cute.

572
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:03,456
What?

573
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:04,271
Can I see?

574
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:07,949
That’s so funny.

575
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:09,280
Post it on our café’s instagram.

576
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,088
Delete it and take a new one.

577
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:14,000
No, this one is cute.

578
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,599
You’re going to ruin my image.

579
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,744
Oh, come on.

580
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,552
Hey.

581
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:35,615
Hey.

582
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:37,983
Hey.

583
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,512
Nana?

584
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,096
You’re Nana, right?

585
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:47,887
Yes.

586
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,344
I’m scared.

587
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:55,340
I want to go home.

588
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,340
Calm down,

589
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:59,340
but you’re fine, right?

590
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:00,847
Did they hurt you?

591
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,431
No,

592
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,512
but they kept forcing me to eat sweets.

593
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:09,840
Don’t be scared.

594
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,063
I will find us a way out.
