What’s going on between you and Jean?

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,629
Are you leaving us to be with him?

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,060
I haven’t…

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,310
If I sleep with you,

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,649
will you stay?

16
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,489
Oh, Boss.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,569
You don’t have to go that far.

18
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,049
What?

19
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,780
Does this mean you’re not leaving us to be with Jean?

20
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,870
Even though I’m dating Jean,

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,840
I’m not going to leave Sweet Day.

22
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,000
I still want to be with everyone here.

23
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,000
Besides,

24
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,930
I haven’t found you your first love yet.

25
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,329
I was scared you were going to leave us.

26
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,840
Do you know how stressed out I was?

27
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,060
That’s why I would even sleep with you.

28
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,389
I mean trade my body.

29
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,740
I’m so honored that you would trade your body for me.

30
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,960
You’re the cutest, Boss.’

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,330
On second thought,

32
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,150
I should kiss you once and take my gain.

33
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,469
Go away.

34
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,039
It’s your gain but my loss.

Don’t run in the house, Baby Pig.

44
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,419
I’ll wear these later in the car.

45
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,569
Just a minute.

46
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,860
Piglet, you can share this with your friends at school.

47
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,949
Thanks, Weir.

48
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,460
Let’s go, Pooh Bear.

49
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,770
Baby Pig, you need to wear your socks.

50
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,669
I’ll put them on in the car.

51
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,669
The car key!

52
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,669
Where’s the car key?

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,530
Here it is.

54
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:13,919
Thank you so much.

55
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,120
Run, Baby Pig!

This dad and daughter started making noise since early morning.

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,779
Darling, could you pass me the salt?

58
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:28,779
Here you are.

59
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,079
What does that couple think my house is?

60
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,279
Jean, I know how to do it.

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,279
Should we, Uncle?

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,519
Good idea.

63
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,290
What do you think?

64
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,480
Still as yummy as ever.

65
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,529
Both the pasta and your feelings are still the same, right?

66
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,189
I feel the same as well.

67
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,829
You’re amazed at my skills?

68
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,060
I’m annoyed.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,730
You have your own house.

70
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,920
I don’t get why you came here.

71
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,540
I came because of this cutie.

72
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,550
Is everyone in France this lame?

73
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,199
If you want to know,

74
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,199
why don’t you go live there?

75
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,439
Actually, that’s why I invited Jean here today.

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,189
Huh?

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,189
What’s this about?

78
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,000
Why didn’t you discuss it with me first?

79
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,430
Krating is my guy.

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,029
Come on, Boss.

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,660
I’ve seen how talented Krating is at making desserts

82
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,050
and Jean agrees

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,339
that if Krating gets the opportunity to learn and practice, he’ll go far.

84
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,639
That’s why he wants to send Krating to a dessert school in France.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Don’t worry.

86
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I’ll pay for all your expenses.

87
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,870
What?

88
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,480
You really have talent.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,100
Ever since I started making desserts,

90
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,100
you’re the only person after Weir that I see potential in.

91
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,730
That won’t be necessary.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
I can pay for Krating’s expenses myself.

93
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,050
But I don’t want…
Really?

94
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,459
You’re so kind, Boss. I knew it.

95
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,560
But it will be expensive.

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,329
Are you sure it’s not unaffordable for you?

97
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,149
The word ‘unaffordable’ is not in my dictionary.

98
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,879
Then I’ll contact the school in France

99
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,769
and let you know about the expenses later.

100
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,149
Hold on.

101
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,579
Do I really have to go study abroad?

102
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,019
Krating,

103
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,430
my lessons and their lessons are very different.

104
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,279
If you go there,

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,019
I guarantee you will learn so much more.

106
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,240
But I don’t want to…

107
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,040
You said you wanted to become a good pastry chef, didn’t you?

108
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:15,870
Trust me.

109
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,720
Krating,

110
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,480
come here.

111
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,240
What’s going on, Uncle?

112
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,279
This is Mr. Pierre,

113
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,949
your French tutor.

114
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,189
Do I have to take a lesson now?

115
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:40,889
Yes.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Weir and I want you to learn the language first

117
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,930
so you won’t struggle when you get there.

118
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,009
But I don’t want to.

119
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:50,639
Bonjour.

120
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,790
My name is Pierre.

121
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,470
No, Uncle. I don’t want to learn.

122
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,379
You have to.

123
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:57,930
I’ve already paid for it.

124
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,360
Then ask for a refund.

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,079
Hey, you can’t talk like that to someone who supports your study.

126
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,579
Krating,

127
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,209
don’t be stubborn.

128
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,759
I thought you said you wanted to become the best pastry chef.

129
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,529
But I…

130
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,410
No buts.

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,550
I will support you to become a very good chef.

132
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,009
You will become even better than that golden-haired, small-eyed Jean.

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,889
Boss,

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,930
did you say that because you’re jealous?

135
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,139
I said that because I hate your boyfriend.

136
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,620
I don’t know why you keep doing this when you already have a boyfriend.

137
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,000
Boss.

138
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,009
Ah, beh, seh, deh, eh, eff, jheh.

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,799
Ah, beh, seh, deh, e, f, g.

140
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,200
No, I didn’t pronounce them that way.

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,919
Let’s try again.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,690
Ah, beh, seh, deh, eh, eff, jheh.

143
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,860
It’s difficult.

144
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,990
No one can remember them in such a short time.

145

[Saying French alphabets]

146
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,039
You can go on until Z, can’t you?

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
What’s up, Krating?

148
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,799
Is it okay if I don’t go to France?

149
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,179
Krating,

150
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,690
I told you that if you wanted to become a talented chef,

151
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,210
you have to study there

152
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,700
and you have to take it very seriously.

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,639
But I don’t…

154
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,639
Hello, Jean.

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,639
I’m home.

156
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,639
No, I haven’t eaten anything.

157
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Okay, I can leave right away.

158
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,600
Sorry.

159
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,879
It’s always hard at first, Krating.

160
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,879
Keep going.

161
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,320
I know you can do it.

162
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
If you have any problems or don’t understand something,

163
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,039
you can ask me,

164
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,480
okay?

165
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,480
Please close the door for me.

166
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:39,789
What’s up?

167
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,320
I don’t understand anything in my lessons.

168
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,629
Can I stop taking French?

169
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,440
Pay more attention.

170
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,950
I’m not smart.

171
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,100
I’m stupid.

172
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,519
Krating,

173
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,519
there are no stupid people in this world,

174
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,940
only people who don’t try.

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,080
But I…

176
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,129
You have to stop with the buts.

177
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,549
Stop with the excuses.

178
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,129
And you’ll become better than that golden-haired, small-eyed Jean.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,350
I want to see you become better than him.

180
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,350
I feel satisfied just thinking about it.

181
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,600
You only care about Jean.

182
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:22,039
What?

183
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,690
He’s not the only one I think about.

184
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,360
Hey! Krating!

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
If this is about learning French,

186
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,649
I understand.

187
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:57,360
Young Master once told me that sometimes humans can be unbelievably smart.

188
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,679
We can understand difficult things easily.

189
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,840
But for some people, it’s not always the case.

190
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:13,440
I think maybe you and I are one of those people.

191
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,220
Actually, that’s not the only thing I’m worried about.

192
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,440
I just don’t want to go anywhere anymore.

193
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,799
I could explain

194
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,009
but no one would understand.

195
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,009
No one is like me.

196
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,289
Baby Pig is calling.

197
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,220
Please excuse me.

198
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,220
Baby Pig!

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,149
I’m the only one in this house who’s never had a family.

200
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:37,740
I’m hungry.

201
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,860
Me too.

202
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,509
Hello.

203
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:41,529
Can I take your order?

204
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,120
Hey, Piglet. What are you doing here?

205
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,840
I’m helping Dad work.

206
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:49,720
Dad?

207
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,039
This is my dad.

208
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
Pooh Bear,

209
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,679
this is Ms. Im-Aim, my class teacher.

210
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,169
Hello, Ms. Im-Aim.

211
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,809
I’m Baby Pig’s parent.

212
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,620
I mean Piglet’s.

213
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,289
Hello, Piglet’s dad.

214
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,740
What would you guys like to order?

215
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
I’ll quickly get them for you.

216
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,919
Oh, okay, can I have the afternoon tea set?

217
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,659
I’d like a glass of peach tea, please.

218
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,289
Okay.

219
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,649
Let’s go get the desserts ready, Pooh Bear.

220
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,440
I didn’t know Mr. Pooh had a daughter.

221
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,440
They look so different from each other,

222
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,720
True.

223
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,200
Mr. Tinnapop.

224
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,350
Hi.

225
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,769
Sorry I’m late.

226
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,100
Have you been waiting long?

227
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,740
Not at all.	We just arrived.

228
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,190
Mone, this is Mr. Tinnapop, the new science teacher.

229
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:52,730
He’ll be helping me teach.

230
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,769
You can call me Toomtam.

231
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,629
Alright, feel free to order anything you’d like.

232
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,450
Think of this as a welcome treat.

233
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,450
Okay. These all look so good.

234
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,230
Here’s your order.

235
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,720
Wow, this looks so good.

236
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,629
This looks so good.

237
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,059
Are you okay?

238
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,450
Oh, Piglet, this is Mr. Toomtam.

239
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,789
He’s going to help me teach soon.

240
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,789
Hello, teacher.

241
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,169
Please try the canelé.

242
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,169
It’s our best seller.

243
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,840
Let’s eat, shall we?

244
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes.

245
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,639
It’s really good.

246
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,970
I’ve never had a canelé this good anywhere.

247
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,240
Did Chef Weir make this?

248
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,049
No, Krating did.

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,049
Really? Krating?

250
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,360
Wow.

251
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,769
It’s yummy.

252
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,500
It’s good, isn’t it?

253
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,009
I think Krating will go far.

254
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,049
That’s good.

255
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,529
When you return from France, you can be our other chef,

256
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,879
alright, Krating?

257
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,769
If you want to ask people what they do for work,

258
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,409
you have to say “Quelle est votre profession?”

259
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,200
Could you repeat after me?

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Quelle est votre pro…

261
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,399
pro fession?

262
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,669
Try again.

263
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,799
You have to pronounce it this way:

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
Quelle est votre profession?

265
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,190
Je suis pâtissier.

266
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,190
I’m a pastry chef.

267
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,480
Quelle… quelle est votre profession?

268
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,399
Why can’t you remember it?

269
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,429
It’s hard.

270
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,639
More like you’re not trying hard,

271
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,679
Ting Nong Noy. (silly words)

272
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,929
If you can’t even remember an easy phrase like this,

273
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,549
how are you going to learn everything else?

274
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,039
You’ll never be a pastry chef, Ting Nong Noy.

275
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,759
How much longer are you going to call me Ting Nong Noy?

276
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,059
I said my name is Krating.

277
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,059
You’re Ting Nong Noy.

278
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,759
Krating, calm down!

279
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,440
Fight me.

280
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Krating, stop!

281
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,589
Mr. Krating.

282
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,329
He won’t stop calling me Ting Nong Noy.

283
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,579
I said my name is Krating.

284
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,109
Krating!

285
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,309
Calm down.

286
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:31,900
Stop.

287
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,700
Calm down.

288
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,210
You’re supposed to be learning, not being a thug.

289
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,589
He’s right, Krating.

290
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,000
You can’t do this to other people.

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,299
He’s rude!

292
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,660
How could he say that?

293
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,019
Because you act like this,

294
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,480
he’s right to criticize you.

295
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,519
Yes! I suck!

296
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,279
I don’t have parents.

297
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,099
This has nothing to do with that, Krating.

298
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,279
Pierre is your tutor.

299
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,910
If you’re still like this, how can you go to France?

300
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,460
Why is everyone sending me away?

301
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,640
I don’t want to go to France.

302
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,190
Don’t you understand?

303
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,019
I’m not going.

304
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:12,599
Hey! Ting!

305
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,630
Calm down, Young Master.

306
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,650
What is wrong with him?

307
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,049
Where is Krating?

308
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,230
It’s late. Why isn’t he back yet?

309
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,160
Weir,

310
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,170
please call him.

311
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,119
Okay.

312
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,839
His phone is off. I can’t get hold of him.

313
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,519
I’ll go look for him.

314
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,829
I’ll drive you, Young Master.

315
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:37,900
No,

316
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,190
you stay with Weir.

317
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:42,730
Alright.

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,380
Here.

319
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,339
Did you think you’re a lead guy in a Korean series?

320
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,990
I was scared you’d be grazed by that car. By the way,

321
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,069
why won’t you go home?

322
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,759
I don’t have a home to go back to.

323
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,920
Hey, I was just asking.

324
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,200
Do you really have to be dramatic?

325
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,599
I’ve never had a home.

326
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,130
Never had a family.

327
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,859
No one wants me.

328
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,609
Don’t be sad.

329
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,109
You’re a grown man, aren’t you?

330
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,630
You can take care of yourself.

331
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,559
Besides, everyone at the café takes care of you like family.

332
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,250
But they’re not my real family, are they?

333
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,250
All my life,

334
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,950
I’ve never understood the meaning of family.

335
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,759
The closest thing to that was the boxing academy.

336
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,700
But now I can’t box anymore.

337
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,559
I couldn’t stay there forever.

338
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,880
Why not?

339
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,309
Coach Choke seems to love you.

340
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,769
But he has his real family.

341
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,970
I’m just a boxer in the academy.

342
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,490
Ever since I came to Sweet Day,

343
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,670
I feel like it’s my other home.

344
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,920
Like it’s my family.

345
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,470
But I’m probably the only one who feels that way.

346
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:44,480
In the end,

347
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,160
I’m an outsider, as always.

348
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:50,859
What makes you think that?

349
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,319
Everyone keeps trying to send me away.

350
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
They want to send me abroad to study.

351
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,720
Oh.

352
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,910
You’re so s and s.

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
What do you mean?

354
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,589
Stupid and silly.

355
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:17,420
Hey, you’re supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this,

356
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,809
not laughing at me.

357
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,599
I’m laughing at your silliness.

358
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:26,140
Look, do you really think that

359
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:31,160
people who want to get rid of you or think of you as an outsider

360
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,359
would invest in your study abroad?

361
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,599
Listen.

362
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,559
People who don’t really love or care for you wouldn’t want good things for you like they do.

363
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,190
Same with Coach Choke.

364
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,059
Everyone thinks of you as family.

365
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,029
Only you are too silly to see it.

366
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,559
You misunderstood what family is.

367
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,759
Can I help you?

368
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,980
Do you want to apply for our course? We’re closed now.

369
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,849
No, Coach.

370
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:20,940
I’m the owner of the café Krating is working at.

371
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,690
Oh.

372
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:25,950
Sweet Day?

373
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,599
Is something the matter?

374
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:29,390
Why did you come here so late?

375
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,200
Has Krating come here at all?

376
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,619
I haven’t seen him.

377
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,519
Did he stir up trouble?

378
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,519
No,

379
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,519
but we’re in a fight.

380
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,200
So Krating didn’t go home.

381
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:48,970
No.

382
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,940
I just want to send Krating to a dessert school in France

383
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
but it seems like he doesn’t want to go

384
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,720
even though this opportunity could help him become a talented pastry chef.

385
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,799
I really don’t understand him.

386
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,049
He said he wanted to become a world class chef

387
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,339
but why is he acting like this?

388
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,890
He probably thinks you want to get rid of him.

389
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,960
Get rid of him?

390
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,690
How am I getting rid of him?

391
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,670
Krating might be a fighter and a strong man,

392
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,359
but he’s a sensitive soul.

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,319
He likes to think he’s an orphan who’s loved and wanted by no one.

394
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,599
He probably thinks of you guys as family

395
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,849
and thinks you’re sending him away because you want to get rid of him.

396
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,710
Don’t worry.

397
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,279
When he comes to his senses, he will come back.

398
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,549
He’s like a son to me.

399
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,660
Please take care of him.

400
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,460
Of course.

401
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,089
Krating.

402
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,279
Guys,

403
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,519
I’m sorry.

404
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,890
I canceled your French tutoring sessions

405
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,099
and if you don’t want to study in France,

406
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,200
you don’t have to go.

407
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,920
I’m sorry for forcing you to do this without asking what you want.

408
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,740
I want you to go not because I want to get rid of you.

409
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:37,920
I just want my first and only student to become successful and get the best thing.

410
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,329
Why are you crying?

411
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,769
You’re important to us, Krating.

412
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,880
Our café can’t do without you.

413
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,470
You’re a part of Sweet Day.

414
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,470
You’re a part of our family.

415
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,529
From now on, you don’t have to feel bad

416
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,200
and run anywhere.

417
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,420
Understand?

418
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,420
Hey.

419
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,529
You don’t have to hug me.

420
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,680
Fine, just this once.

421
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,470
I’ve made my decision.

422
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,660
I’m going to study in France.

423
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,259
I will become a talented chef like you.

424
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,930
Young Master!

425
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,200
Krating!

426
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,420
Hey.What’s wrong with you?

427
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,680
Why are you crying?

428
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,619
I can’t breathe.

429
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,009
Krating, from now on, if there’s anything you feel uncomfortable with,

430
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:54,990
be honest with us.

431
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,930
We’re family now.

432
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,720
We help each other.

433
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:01,769
Got it.

434
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,809
Ouch!

435
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,809
That’s for making me worried.

436
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,140
And now I have to go to trouble to find you a new tutor.

437
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,509
You don’t have to.

438
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:11,839
I found one myself.

439
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:14,880
Who?

440
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:17,609
Okay.

441
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,529
This word, sucré, means sweet.

442
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,359
For example, le gâteau est très sucré.

443
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,549
This sentence means the cake is very sweet.

444
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,960
Repeat after me.

445
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,880
Sucré.

446
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,990
Sucré.

447
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,319
Correct.

448
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,589
Very good, Ting Nong Noy.

449
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,529
Actually, Ting Nong Noy sounds kind of cute.

450
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,829
Right? I told you so.

451
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,539
Then I’ll keep calling you that.

452
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,039
Some people just look cute no matter what they do.

453
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:13,390
But cute people are usually taken.

454
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,180
Hey, are you here to tutor me or do what?

455
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,279
Did you get it?

456
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,150
How do we pronounce that word?

457
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,660
I need your advice on something.

458
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,569
What is it?

459
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,349
It’s about	Krating.

460
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:43,900
Actually, we could pass as Krating’s parents.

461
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,279
Krating is our son. You’re the father.

462
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,000
And I’m the mother.

463
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,160
Your imagination has run wild.

464
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,960
What’s it about then?

465
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,480
I’m going to invite a special guest to our café soon.

466
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,410
Who’s this special guest?

467
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,319
You don’t have to know yet.

468
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:07,500
Just know that he really wants to try Krating’s desserts.

469
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:11,500
What do you think Krating should make him?

470
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,799
He actually makes very yummy French toast.

471
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,950
but if he has to make a special dish for a special person,

472
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,869
why don’t we make him come up with his own recipe?

473
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,740
Good idea.

474
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,470
Can you guide him then?

475
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:32,680
Sure.

476
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:44,680
Ms. Nuan.

477
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,650
Ms. Nuan.

478
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,630
Madam!

479
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,500
This way!

480
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,140
Wait a minute, Ms. Nuan.

481
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,849
You guys.

482
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,890
Can we speak to Mr. Tert?

483
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,559
No.

484
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:05,559
Why do you want to speak to him now?

485
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,559
Look,

486
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,599
we’re so sorry we abandoned your son’s case back then.

487
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:24,430
But now we just want to know if Mr. Tert kidnapped the kids 21 years ago?

488
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,299
What are you talking about?

489
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,048
The boy Mr. Tert kidnapped looked like your son.

490
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:52,039
[The Return of the Children Kidnapper, A 10-Year-Old Boy is Missing]

491
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,384
Get out!

492
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,199
Or I’ll call the police you’re trespassing in my house.

493
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,735
Leave!

494
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,423
Ms. Nuan.

495
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,327
Ms. Nuan, wait.

496
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:20,400
Ms. Nuan.

497
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,295
Tert and Nuan must be involved in the children’s kidnapping.

498
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,536
Yes. I think so too.

499
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,103
What do we do next?

500
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,487
We have to follow this to the end.

501
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:40,735
Otherwise, worse things will surely follow.

502
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:58,063
Do you remember my lesson on how to make French toast?

503
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,255
That’s the basics.

504
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:05,744
Today I want you to create your own recipe for French toast.

505
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:09,184
Why do I have to?

506
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,032
Because it’ll be a special recipe for a special guest.

507
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:18,271
I really want to know who this special guest is.

508
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:21,260
Alright, let’s not waste time.

509
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,264
Alright, let’s not waste time.We should get started.

510
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:22,496
We should get started.

511
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:23,936
Remember, Krating.

512
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:27,487
It’s good to follow the original recipe

513
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,831
but it’s also important to create a new one.

514
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:36,639
You have to be able to add your own personality to the dish.

515
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:42,704
Just like artists who have their own signatures and styles,

516
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,224
chefs like us have our own tastes and ingredients.

517
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:52,480
Okay, let’s get started.

518
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:56,143
Why are we having this crazy guy teach him?

519
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,260
Krating, hold that tight.

520
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,264
Krating, hold that tight.That’s it.

521
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:06,079
That’s it.

522
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:17,840
Focus.

523
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:29,039
Try it.

524
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,423
I think it’s still too simple.

525
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,896
That one looks burnt.

526
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:24,447
Not bad.

527
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,440
I think it could be even better.

528
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,239
So good.

529
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,000
The milk is so rich.

530
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,530
Who’s this special guest, Uncle?

531
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,335
You’ll know soon enough.

532
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:16,329
Is it a movie star?

533
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:17,536
Tell me please.

534
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:19,072
Is it a man or a woman?

535
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:22,239
There he is.

536
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,135
Coach.

537
00:39:33,775 --> 00:39:36,159
Our special guest today is Coach Choke.

538
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:37,903
Do your best, Krating.

539
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:41,248
We all want him to try your dessert

540
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:43,503
before you leave to study in France.

541
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,248
Where’s the dessert you’re making me?

542
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:50,800
I prepared my stomach for it.

543
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:52,800
I haven’t eaten anything since morning.

544
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,496
Give me a few minutes.

545
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,367
I’ll go get it ready.

546
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:07,887
This way, please.

547
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,135
Here you are.

548
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,824
Wow.

549
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,130
This is a French toast pudding.

550
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,487
Whoa.

551
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,927
I didn’t know you speak such good English.

552
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,039
It’s only normal

553
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,400
for a soon-to-be top pastry chef

554
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,407
for a soon-to-be top pastry chefto speak good English.

555
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,920
to speak good English.

556
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,856
But I think I saw you practicing in the kitchen earlier.

557
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,472
Please have a bite, Coach.

558
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:50,063
I came up with this dish myself.

559
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,512
Let me see if it’s any good.

560
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,510
What do you think, Coach?

561
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:14,911
Mm.

562
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:17,168
Mm?

563
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,639
Why are you crying?

564
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,135
Is it that bad?

565
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,976
I’m so proud.

566
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,391
Proud?

567
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:49,072
Your dessert is very much to my taste.

568
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,887
I’m really proud of you.

569
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:57,168
I believe you’re going to become the most talented pastry chef in the world.

570
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,224
I’m sure of it.

571
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,208
I have one more thing to tell you.

572
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,632
You are not alone.

573
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,840
You have people around you

574
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:14,655
who love and worry about you all the time

575
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,168
both at the boxing academy and this café.

576
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:26,768
To everyone,

577
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:30,768
you’re family.

578
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,760
And family has nothing to do with blood.

579
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,527
It has to do with bond.

580
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,576
Understand?

581
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:55,887
Coach.

582
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,807
You can do it.

583
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,423
I believe in you.

584
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,711
Why did you come here again?

585
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:43,168
Ms. Nuan, please let us speak to Mr. Tert.

586
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:44,416
You should leave.

587
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:46,032
Leave us alone.

588
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,208
But if you let this go on,

589
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:51,311
bad things could happen to the kids again.

590
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,096
How dare you talk about this again?

591
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,344
Twenty-one years ago, you were the ones who made things turn out this way.

592
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,559
You chose to sit by and do nothing.

593
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:09,295
That’s why my son is dead.

594
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:12,880
Where are you going?

595
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,570
Stay with Daddy.

596
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:14,576
Stay with Daddy.There’s a kid inside.

597
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:17,152
There’s a kid inside.

598
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,552
Stop!

599
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:23,019
I said stop!

600
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:23,023
I said stop!Get out of my house!

601
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:24,431
Get out of my house!

602
00:44:25,103 --> 00:44:26,032
Stop!

603
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:29,231
Stop!

604
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:37,230
Open your mouth, son,

605
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:39,903
so I can feed you.

606
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,976
You don’t want to eat it?

607
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,367
I’ll eat it then.

608
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:46,719
It’s good.
