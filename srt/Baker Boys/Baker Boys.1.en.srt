I know it’s your birthday today,

7
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:09,099
so I have something to confess.

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,459

Punn.

18
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,617
What’s up, my beautiful Prae?

19
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,530
Do you feel anything at all?

20
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:46,538
Do you feel anything at all?You’re so late.

21
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,628
You’re so late.

22
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:47,633
You’re so late.Do you feel guilty at all, huh?

23
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,899
Do you feel guilty at all, huh?

24
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,688
You know how Bangkok roads are, don’t you?

25
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:54,699
You know how Bangkok roads are, don’t you?Bangkok roads and you are just alike.

26
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,098
Bangkok roads and you are just alike.

27
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:58,057
How?

28
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,400
They both suck.

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,288
Traffic always gets terrible.

30
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:00,299
Traffic always gets terrible.Cars can suddenly get stuck in potholes while we’re driving.

31
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,468
Cars can suddenly get stuck in potholes while we’re driving.

32
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:01,473
Cars can suddenly get stuck in potholes while we’re driving.Some roads just keep being under construction.

33
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,620
Some roads just keep being under construction.

34
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,622
Some roads just keep being under construction.They’re never going to finish though 20 years have passed.

35
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:05,258
They’re never going to finish though 20 years have passed.

36
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,538
You’re mad at me, aren’t you?

37
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:14,650
It’s time.

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:14,656
It’s time.Alright.

39
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:15,250
Alright.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,251
Alright.You’re hungry already, right?
Let’s order then.

41
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,250
You’re hungry already, right?
Let’s order then.

42
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,258
You’re hungry already, right?
Let’s order then.It’s time for us to break up!

43
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:20,139
It’s time for us to break up!

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,538
Prae.

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,620
You can’t just break up with me because of Bangkok roads.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:25,622
You can’t just break up with me because of Bangkok roads.I’m breaking up with you

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,120
I’m breaking up with you

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,121
I’m breaking up with youbecause you never care about me.

49
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,878
because you never care about me.

50
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:30,378
When something is going on, you never tell me.

51
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:30,382
When something is going on, you never tell me.Even if you're having a nightmare every night,

52
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:31,960
Even if you're having a nightmare every night,

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:31,962
Even if you're having a nightmare every night,you never tell me what you dreamed about.

54
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,538
you never tell me what you dreamed about.

55
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,650
It’s just a nightmare, so why do you want to know about it?

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:36,657
It’s just a nightmare, so why do you want to know about it?But when you had a nightmare, you always shoved me away!

57
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,830
But when you had a nightmare, you always shoved me away!

58
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,240
That’s why I have the right to know

59
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:38,830
But when you had a nightmare, you always shoved me away!That’s why I have the right to know

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,241
That’s why I have the right to knowwhat on earth you dreamed about.

61
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,479
what on earth you dreamed about.

62
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,657
I’m breaking up with you anyway.

63
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:41,479
what on earth you dreamed about.I’m breaking up with you anyway.

64
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,650
But before we break up,

65
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,377
I have something for you.

66
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:53,878
You’ve prepared a gift for our break-up day?

67
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:53,882
You’ve prepared a gift for our break-up day?What a romantic person.

68
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,179
What a romantic person.

69
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,538
Do you know that I really love cakes,

70
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:02,859
especially strawberry cakes?

71
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,090
But since I’ve started dating you,

72
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,139
I’ve never got to eat it even once.

73
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,459
Since we’re breaking up,

74
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,778
let’s eat this cake with me, will you?

75
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,978
At least, we can have a good memory to keep.

76
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,059
Can I sit with you?

77
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,379
I’m sorry. Your shirt is stained.

78
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:05,382
I’m sorry. Your shirt is stained.Let me wash it for you.

79
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,177
Let me wash it for you.

80
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:28,778
Hey.

81
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,139
Look at your big smile, Weir.

82
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,129
That means you…

83
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,610
By the way, let me ask you something.

84
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:38,612
By the way, let me ask you something.Have you ever loved someone for real?

85
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:41,480
Have you ever loved someone for real?

86
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,670
Yes. There’s one.

87
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,673
Yes. There’s one.That was when I was still studying.

88
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:49,899
That was when I was still studying.

89
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,911
But he broke my heart.

90
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:57,098
How could a person like you get heartbroken?

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,980
It's actually not a heartbreak tho.

92
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:05,737
I’d rather call it a painful memory.

93
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,579
Wow.

94
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,019
Bomb.

95
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,019
Here’s your cake.

96
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,899
Please enjoy.

97
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,499
What’s wrong, young boy?

98
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,338
It’s nothing.

99
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,139
If you’re not feeling well,

100
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:30,141
If you’re not feeling well,I can have this cake packed for you to bring home.

101
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,098
I can have this cake packed for you to bring home.

102
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,788
It’s alright.

103
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,778
I’m just a bit dizzy.

104
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:54,218
Auntie,

105
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,579
may I ask you something?

106
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,338
Why do people enjoy eating cakes?

107
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:11,499
I think their sweetness can make us happy.

108
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,730
Our happiness starts from a little thing like this.

109
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:17,737
Our happiness starts from a little thing like this.I’ve been selling cakes for 20 years already.

110
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,579
I’ve been selling cakes for 20 years already.

111
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,899
I'm so happy to see those kids eating the cakes I make.

112
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,048
Actually, I came to buy a cake here 20 years ago.

113
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,690
Do you remember me?

114
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:35,697
Do you remember me?How can I?

115
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,889
How can I?

116
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:37,899
How can I?It’s 20 years ago.

117
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,778
It’s 20 years ago.

118
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,177
I can’t remember it.

119
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,259
Well then, how much is it in total?

120
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,538
This piece of cake is 80 baht.

121
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,899
I’m talking about your store.

122
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:03,330
How much are you selling it?

123
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:03,339
How much are you selling it?Huh?

124
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:04,129
Huh?

125
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:27,658
Baby boy, actually you don't like eating desserts, do you?

126
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,000
Why do you want to open a bakery café then?

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,139
I don't get it.

128
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:31,142
I don't get it.Mom!

129
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:33,577
Mom!

130
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,120
I told you not to call me baby boy.

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
This baby boy is…

132
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:40,567
I mean ‘I’m’ already 30.

133
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,710
Mommy is already used to calling you like this.

134
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,715
Mommy is already used to calling you like this.If you don’t want me to call you baby boy, what should mommy call you then?

135
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,528
If you don’t want me to call you baby boy, what should mommy call you then?

136
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:46,538
If you don’t want me to call you baby boy, what should mommy call you then?My name is Punn.

137
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,730
My name is Punn.

138
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:48,734
My name is Punn.Mommy named it yourself, didn’t you?

139
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,980
Mommy named it yourself, didn’t you?

140
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:50,988
Mommy named it yourself, didn’t you?Should we change your name from Punn to Baby boy,

141
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,340
Should we change your name from Punn to Baby boy,

142
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,370
so mommy can call you easily?

143
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,375
so mommy can call you easily?Mommy, that’s not the right solution.

144
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,538
Mommy, that’s not the right solution.

145
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,058
Why not?

146
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:00,062
Why not?Oh, my baby boy.

147
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,889
Oh, my baby boy.

148
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:01,899
Oh, my baby boy.Mommy’s baby boy.

149
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,298
Mommy’s baby boy.

150
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,649
Well, why do you want to open a bakery café then?

151
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:07,658
Well, why do you want to open a bakery café then?Hmm?

152
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,099
Hmm?

153
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,979
I want to open a bakery café because…

154
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,946
beautiful girls like to hang out there.

155
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,090
If we decorate our café nicely,

156
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,096
If we decorate our café nicely,tons of people will come to us.

157
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,700

and you can have one dessert for free.

163
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,817
Baby boy, do you know that the reason you just said is…

164
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:43,177
Why? You don’t approve of it?

165
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,658

168
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:55,370

Good boy.

176
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:11,019
Good boy.My dearest son.

177
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,937
My dearest son.

178
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:19,330
Mommy,

179
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:19,331
Mommy,didn't you say you would arrange a pastry chef to meet me today?

180
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:22,538
didn't you say you would arrange a pastry chef to meet me today?

181
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:25,418
Where? He's not here yet.

182
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,339
Excuse me.

183
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,610
I'm here for a job interview as previously confirmed.

184
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:32,619
I'm here for a job interview as previously confirmed.I'm applying for a pastry chef position.

185
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,538
I'm applying for a pastry chef position.

186
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:37,840
Punn.

187
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,288
I…

188
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:40,298
I…I… like you.

189
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,288
I… like you.

190
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,099
Is something wrong?

191
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,928
It seems you have invested a lot.

192
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,859
Is there something on my face?

193
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,225
Your name is Weir, right?

194
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,889
You have been a pastry chef before, right?

195
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:25,899
You have been a pastry chef before, right?Yes.

196
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:26,820
Yes.

197
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:26,826
Yes.I worked as a chef at a cafe’ in France.

198
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,360
I worked as a chef at a cafe’ in France.

199
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,658
The café’s name is…

200
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I worked as a chef at a cafe’ in France.The café’s name is…

201
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:33,577
Hmm, no.

202
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,570
Well…

203
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:42,880
L'oeuf ou la poule.

204
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,538
It’s a well-known dessert café in Paghee.

205
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,720
Paki?

206
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,009
Didn’t you say it’s in France?

207
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,041
Why Pakistan?

208
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,730
I mean Paris.

209
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:53,739
I mean Paris.In French, Paris is pronounced Paghee.

210
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,808
In French, Paris is pronounced Paghee.

211
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,979
Paghee?

212
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,099
Other stores probably hire you right away after reading your resume,

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,979
but here,

214
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:15,580
what about making me one dessert dish?

215
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,259
Can you do it?

216
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:03,330
Please taste it.

217
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,735
It’s alright.

218
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:08,139
I’m going to hire you then.

219
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,928
You can start working here as soon as our café’ opens.

220
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:13,931
You can start working here as soon as our café’ opens.Wait.

221
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,336
Wait.

222
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,769
I have a confession to make.

223
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:19,773
I have a confession to make.Maybe he remembers?

224
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:21,528
Maybe he remembers?

225
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:21,534
Maybe he remembers?That I threw a cake right into his face?

226
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:23,495
That I threw a cake right into his face?

227
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,697
I think you should know it.

228
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,979
After I came back from France,

229
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,730
in the last two years,

230
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,619
I was fired by more than 10 dessert cafés.

231
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,590
Why did they fire you?

232
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,591
Why did they fire you?What did you do?

233
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:54,517
What did you do?

234
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,509
It's because I'm gay.

235
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,528
Some didn’t fire me,

236
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,528
but I resigned myself.

237
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,697
That’s not going to be a problem.

238
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,577
I don’t care what you are.

239
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,979
I only care about your skills.

240
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,298
I’m not just an ordinary gay.

241
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:19,754
I’m the Gay Conquerer.

242
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,750
It might sound unbelievable

243
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,899
but I have a special ability of attracting everyone to like me.

244
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:28,288
Customers and staff

245
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:28,298
Customers and staffusually fight over me.

246
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,139
usually fight over me.

247
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:30,142
usually fight over me.Most recently,

248
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,168
Most recently,

249
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:31,177
Most recently,a married owner was crazy in love with me.

250
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:34,538
a married owner was crazy in love with me.

251
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,200
We won’t have that problem here.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,201
We won’t have that problem here.Come with me tonight.

253
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,210
Come with me tonight.

254
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,216
Come with me tonight.I want you to see another side of me.

255
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:41,250
I want you to see another side of me.

256
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,259
I want you to see another side of me.What?

257
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:41,740
What?

258
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,570
If you can accept the risk,

259
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,457
I will accept your job offer.

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,048
Who’s interviewing who here?

261
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,759
Why did you bring me here?

262
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,470
To show you another side of me.

263
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:02,759
Why did you bring me here?To show you another side of me.

264
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,471
To show you another side of me.But why brought me here?

265
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,739
But why brought me here?

266
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,658
I’m free tonight, Weir.

267
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,057
Let me treat you tonight, Weir.

268
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:12,457
Sorry, I’m with this one tonight.

269
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:13,418
What?

270
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,000
Is he your boyfriend?

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,158
No, I’m not his boyfriend.

272
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:18,219
Are you sure?

273
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,619
Say something.

274
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,057
Hey!

275
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:24,937
He’s really not my boyfriend.

276
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,330
I just wanted to give him an eye-opening experience.

277
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:27,339
I just wanted to give him an eye-opening experience.Let’s talk another day.

278
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,450
Let’s talk another day.

279
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,298
What the hell are you doing?

280
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:39,673
Showing you what I mean by “the Gay Conquerer”.

281
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,710
You came with Weir, right?

282
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:53,714
You came with Weir, right?You’re so lucky.

283
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,177
You’re so lucky.

284
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:58,440
Weir rarely brought a date.

285
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,445
Weir rarely brought a date.It’s not like that.

286
00:16:58,445 --> 00:16:59,979
It’s not like that.

287
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,740
We’re not together.

288
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:02,859
Really?

289
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,097
What are you then?

290
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,459
Old friends, I guess.

291
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,659
Excuse me,

292
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,038
has Weir always been like this?

293
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:22,045
has Weir always been like this?Yes,

294
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:22,940
Yes,

295
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:22,942
Yes,he’s always been handsome,

296
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,930
he’s always been handsome,

297
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:24,939
he’s always been handsome,eloquent and fun to talk to.

298
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,798
eloquent and fun to talk to.

299
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:26,799
eloquent and fun to talk to.Everyone calls him the Gay Conquerer.

300
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,210
Everyone calls him the Gay Conquerer.

301
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,219
Everyone calls him the Gay Conquerer.Why ‘conqueror’?

302
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,038
Why ‘conqueror’?

303
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:32,040
Why ‘conqueror’?Any guy Weir has his eyes on, straight or gay,

304
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,298
Any guy Weir has his eyes on, straight or gay,

305
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:35,307
Any guy Weir has his eyes on, straight or gay,falls in love with him.

306
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,808
falls in love with him.

307
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:37,813
falls in love with him.Me included.

308
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,848
Me included.

309
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:38,857
Me included.What?

310
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,298
What?

311
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:41,838
Are you kidding?

312
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:41,839
Are you kidding?Be careful.

313
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,650
Be careful.

314
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:43,659
Be careful.Luck could play a trick on you.

315
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:45,509
Luck could play a trick on you.

316
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:45,512
Luck could play a trick on you.That’s not going to happen.

317
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:46,528
That’s not going to happen.

318
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:46,538
That’s not going to happen.I would never fall for him.

319
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:48,420
I would never fall for him.

320
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,428
I would never fall for him.Oh,

321
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:49,390
Oh,

322
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,391
Oh,but who could resist his charm?

323
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,880
but who could resist his charm?

324
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:51,881
but who could resist his charm?I could.

325
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:53,739
I could.

326
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:57,577
When I was in school, I broke the Gay Conquerer’s heart.

327
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:02,377
You’re the one who broke Weir’s heart?

328
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,499
Does he really not remember me?

329
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,140
What do you think?

330
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,142
What do you think?You’ve seen another side of me.

331
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:20,130
You’ve seen another side of me.

332
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,137
You’ve seen another side of me.Can you accept it?

333
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,097
Can you accept it?

334
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,939
I already told you it’s not going to be a problem.

335
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,699
But I might cause you and your café trouble in the future.

336
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:33,577
Are you really okay with that?

337
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,459
As long as you can make desserts,

338
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,450
there will be no problems whatsoever.

339
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:40,410
And the problem you mentioned

340
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,414
And the problem you mentionedis hundred percent not going to happen.

341
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:43,179
is hundred percent not going to happen.

342
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:47,979
But I’m really dangerous.

343
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:50,759
Very dangerous.

344
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:50,767
Very dangerous.Especially when you are very much my type.

345
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:54,699
Especially when you are very much my type.

346
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:57,097
Who knows?

347
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:02,857
One day you might fall head over heels for my charm.

348
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,910
That will never happen

349
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:05,913
That will never happenbecause I like women.

350
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,179
because I like women.

351
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,170
I will never fall for your charm.

352
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,857
What makes you so sure?

353
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:16,680
What are you doing?

354
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,210
Testing your confidence.

355
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,219
Testing your confidence.Hold on.

356
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,659
Hold on.

357
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,940
I don’t like men.

358
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:21,943
I don’t like men.Give it a try.

359
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,490
Give it a try.

360
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:23,499
Give it a try.Maybe if you try it once,

361
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,857
Maybe if you try it once,

362
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:29,259
you might fall for a guy like me.

363
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,179
Hey.

364
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,257
Weir, it’s me, Punn.

365
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,250
I know your name is Punn.

366
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,817
Damn it!

367
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,219
Don’t you remember me?

368
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,970
I’m Punnapat Detrachatanan.

369
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,979
Class 6/9 of Saint Joel College.

370
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,699
You confessed your feelings to me on the rooftop.

371
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:57,890
Punn?

372
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,419
That Punn?

373
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,298
Yeah.

374
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,210
It’s me.

375
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,219
It’s me.I’m the guy who threw cake on your face.

376
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,617
I’m the guy who threw cake on your face.

377
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,979
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

378
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:28,298
You didn’t remember, so I didn’t say anything.

379
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,337
I’m sorry.

380
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,179
I was a jerk back then.

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,130
It’s been over 10 years.

382
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,133
It’s been over 10 years.I didn’t recognize you at first.

383
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,066
I didn’t recognize you at first.

384
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,179
You’re not mad at me?

385
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,057
I don’t dwell on the past.

386
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,420
On the contrary, I’m relieved.

387
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,259
Now I can stay at one place for a long time.

388
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,577
So you’ve accepted my offer?

389
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,890
As long as you don’t fall for my charm

390
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,377
or fire me,

391
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,778
there should be no problem.

392
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:22,538
I look forward to working with you, boss.

393
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,857
Then let’s team up

394
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,778
to make this café a success.

395
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,048
Deal.

396
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,769
Deal.

397
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:44,835
Hey,

398
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:46,538
don’t stand still!

399
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:48,430
Krating, don’t go to your corner!

400
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:48,435
Krating, don’t go to your corner!Go out!

401
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:49,685
Go out!

402
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:50,857
Go out!

403
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:10,250
Good!

404
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:12,940
One-two!

405
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:22,538
One-two!

406
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,298
One.

407
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:42,285
Two.

408
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,659
Three.

409
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:43,940
You just finished the fight

410
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,650
and you’re eating a dessert already?

411
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:45,651
and you’re eating a dessert already?I was punched so badly.

412
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,118
I was punched so badly.

413
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:48,125
I was punched so badly.Can’t I have my reward?

414
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,377
Can’t I have my reward?

415
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:51,337
Come on.

416
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:57,097
A reward for a boxer is a winner belt.

417
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,680
If you want to win,

418
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:01,685
If you want to win,don’t eat that kind of thing.

419
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:03,817
don’t eat that kind of thing.

420
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:07,659
I’m only one fight away until I get my winner belt.

421
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,932
For this fight, I will have my cake.

422
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:17,259
Soon, they won’t call you handsome Krating anymore.

423
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,617
They will call you handsome pig instead.

424
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:26,848
Fine,

425
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:26,857
Fine,I’ll give you another one.

426
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:29,259
I’ll give you another one.

427
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,977
Wow.

428
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:42,699
This is so good.

429
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,499
You’ve loved eating cake since you were a kid.

430
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:52,298
Apart from boxing, desserts are the only things that make me happy.

431
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,419
Hey, Krating!

432
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,291
Krating!

433
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:51,337
Krating!

434
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:52,778
Krating, what’s wrong?

435
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:54,699
Krating!

436
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:56,690
Get the doctor.

437
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,057
Krating!

438
00:25:58,483 --> 00:25:59,499
Krating!

439
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,419
Wake up, Krating!

440
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,219
Here’s Krating’s CT scan results, coach.

441
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,118
According to the results,

442
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:19,420
there's a problem with a blood vessel inside his brain,

443
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:19,424
there's a problem with a blood vessel inside his brain,which is called a cerebral aneurysm.

444
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:23,500
which is called a cerebral aneurysm.

445
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,259
What is it, doctor?

446
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,098
Is it dangerous?

447
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:31,102
Is it dangerous?You can’t take this lightly, Krating.

448
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,577
You can’t take this lightly, Krating.

449
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,419
The symptoms may be headaches.

450
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:39,817
There’s a chance your artery could tear

451
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,659
and it could cause paralysis or even death.

452
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,817
Even though this disease can be treated,

453
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:57,097
patients must change their lifestyle to reduce the risk.

454
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,900
You have to avoid smoking,

455
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:58,906
You have to avoid smoking,taking drugs

456
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:00,338
taking drugs

457
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:00,347
taking drugsand drinking all kinds of alcohol.

458
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,368
and drinking all kinds of alcohol.

459
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:02,375
and drinking all kinds of alcohol.Most importantly,

460
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,528
Most importantly,

461
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:04,537
Most importantly,you should avoid head injury.

462
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,179
you should avoid head injury.

463
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:14,377
Can I go back to boxing?

464
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,897
Is there no other way, doctor?

465
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:29,848
Even though it can be treated with surgery,

466
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:29,855
Even though it can be treated with surgery,from a medical standpoint,

467
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:31,690
from a medical standpoint,

468
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,180
I wouldn’t recommend going back to boxing

469
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,188
I wouldn’t recommend going back to boxingbecause there may be relapses in the future.

470
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:38,377
because there may be relapses in the future.

471
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,348
You have to help me, doctor.

472
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:44,355
You have to help me, doctor.Krating.

473
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,577
Krating.

474
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,828
I will do anything.

475
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:48,829
I will do anything.I will do anything you ask,

476
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,848
I will do anything you ask,

477
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:50,857
I will do anything you ask,but please don’t ask me to quit boxing.

478
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:53,739
but please don’t ask me to quit boxing.

479
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:55,659
Krating, calm down.

480
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,670
Help me talk to him, coach.

481
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:02,673
Help me talk to him, coach.Help me talk to him.

482
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:03,817
Help me talk to him.

483
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,808
Krating, calm down.

484
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:15,337
I want you to quit boxing to save your life.

485
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,699
Don’t think too much right now.

486
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,019
Calm down.

487
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,777
According to the CT scan results,

488
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,690
there's a problem with a blood vessel inside his brain,

489
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:43,699
there's a problem with a blood vessel inside his brain,which is called a cerebral aneurysm.

490
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:47,497
which is called a cerebral aneurysm.

491
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:56,130
I’m only one fight away until I get my winner belt.

492
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,137
I’m only one fight away until I get my winner belt.For this fight, I will have my cake.

493
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:59,499
For this fight, I will have my cake.

494
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,700
I will do anything you ask

495
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:01,704
I will do anything you askbut please don’t ask me to quit boxing.

496
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:03,970
but please don’t ask me to quit boxing.

497
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:03,972
but please don’t ask me to quit boxing.Boxing is everything to me.

498
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:06,219
Boxing is everything to me.

499
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,778
I bought you something.

500
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:19,659
Braised pork leg on rice, your favorite.

501
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:24,459
Normally I wouldn’t let you eat it, but today I will.

502
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:26,450
Here you are.

503
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:37,788
Look, Krating,

504
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:37,789
Look, Krating,you have to take good care of your health.

505
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,695
you have to take good care of your health.

506
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,690
Don’t be like this.

507
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:47,009
What would I do that for?

508
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:47,019
What would I do that for?I can’t go back to boxing anyway.

509
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,897
I can’t go back to boxing anyway.

510
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:56,617
You know that boxing is everything to me.

511
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:02,377
If I can’t fight, I don’t know what to live for.

512
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,659
Don’t lose hope in life just yet.

513
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:13,068
We can have more than one dream.

514
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:13,076
We can have more than one dream.You may find new things to love in the future.

515
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:18,699
You may find new things to love in the future.

516
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,618
But my dream is to become a world champion.

517
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:27,817
That’s my biggest dream.

518
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,699
Nothing can replace it.

519
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,655
Krating!

520
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:32,617
Krating!

521
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,617
Boss, do these look okay?

522
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,459
Yeah.

523
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:14,772
They look good.

524
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,769
Have some.

525
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,577
I don’t eat desserts.

526
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:31,179
If you don’t like desserts, why did you open a dessert shop?

527
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,979
I have my reason.

528
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:38,377
Just focus on your work.

529
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,659
Oh, boss.

530
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:47,499
I’m thinking of making crème brûlée for sale on the opening day.

531
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,817
Crème brûlée?

532
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:55,179
What is it?

533
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:59,979
It’s similar to the usual custard puddings

534
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:02,838
but it’s French burnt custard.

535
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:02,842
but it’s French burnt custard.What’s special about it?

536
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:04,778
What’s special about it?

537
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:08,118
It has a very good history.

538
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:13,897
In the past, crème brûlée was a symbol of success for a French restaurant.

539
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:19,659
So I thought it’d be a good choice to open ours.

540
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,288
More importantly,

541
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:21,296
More importantly,I will mix some Thainess with Frenchness

542
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:24,939
I will mix some Thainess with Frenchness

543
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,259
so our menu will be different from the other places.

544
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:34,778
Good idea.

545
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:34,780
Good idea.Let’s do it.

546
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,979
Let’s do it.

547
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:39,337
Then you have to help me with the tasting.

548
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,390
Mango passion fruit crème brûlée is ready.

549
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:46,394
Mango passion fruit crème brûlée is ready.This one is not only sweet,

550
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,459
This one is not only sweet,

551
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:52,298
but also sour from the passion fruit and the mangoes.

552
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,137
It’s still a dessert.

553
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:59,499
If you don’t try my desserts at all,

554
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,190
it’ll be hard for me.

555
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,198
it’ll be hard for me.How else can I get feedback for the desserts I make?

556
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:04,778
How else can I get feedback for the desserts I make?

557
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,179
Please?

558
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,577
Please have some, boss.

559
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,568
Please?

560
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:13,142
Please?

561
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:14,650
Please, boss.

562
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,219
At least a little bite.

563
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,617
Fine.

564
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:22,608
One bite.

565
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,163
Give me a second.

566
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:36,390
When eating crème brûlée,

567
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:36,394
When eating crème brûlée,you have to crack the sugar surface with your spoon

568
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:40,660
you have to crack the sugar surface with your spoon

569
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:40,663
you have to crack the sugar surface with your spoonto savor the taste.

570
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:42,699
to savor the taste.

571
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,720
Why is it so complicated?

572
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:45,721
Why is it so complicated?Wait.

573
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,017
Wait.

574
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:50,377
Crack, not hit.

575
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,179
Don’t hit it too hard.

576
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,777
Is it that bad?

577
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,340
Let’s just say it is

578
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,349
Let’s just say it isand don’t force me to eat it again.

579
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,338
and don’t force me to eat it again.

580
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:24,938
Excuse me.

581
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,297
We’re not open yet.

582
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:29,259
Oh?

583
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,659
But what are these desserts, Uncle?

584
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,018
Uncle?

585
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:41,259
Today is just a trial-run.

586
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,619
These desserts are not officially on sale yet.

587
00:36:45,764 --> 00:36:48,938
Stop by some other day, brother.

588
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,300
Hey.

589
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,302
Hey.We added a new dessert to our menu.

590
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:06,869
We added a new dessert to our menu.

591
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:06,878
We added a new dessert to our menu.Would you be interested in tasting it and giving us feedback?

592
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:10,539
Would you be interested in tasting it and giving us feedback?

593
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,338
Me?

594
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:23,498
Here.

595
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,858
It’s mango passion fruit crème brûlée.

596
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,659
Is it burnt? It’s pitch black.

597
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:38,059
People usually think that desserts are burnt by mistake,

598
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:38,065
People usually think that desserts are burnt by mistake,or that burnt desserts taste bitter,

599
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:40,347
or that burnt desserts taste bitter,

600
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:42,340
but actually it’s like our lives.

601
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,099
If we look closely,

602
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:49,418
it might seem that there are always bad things.

603
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,409
But if we look carefully,

604
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,518
we’ll find that our lives are not that bad.

605
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:55,527
we’ll find that our lives are not that bad.It’s just like this dessert.

606
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,570
It’s just like this dessert.

607
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:57,579
It’s just like this dessert.Just because the outside looks burnt

608
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:00,458
Just because the outside looks burnt

609
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,338
doesn’t mean it tastes bitter inside.

610
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,849
Use your spoon to crack the sugar surface apart

611
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:09,856
Use your spoon to crack the sugar surface apartbefore you eat it.

612
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,795
before you eat it.

613
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,378
How is it?

614
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:39,818
Hey, kid,

615
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:43,179
why are you crying?

616
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,590
Weir,

617
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:47,592
Weir,what did you make him eat?

618
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,378
what did you make him eat?

619
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:56,619
I don’t know what I did wrong.

620
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,016
Is it that bad?

621
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:05,739
No.

622
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:11,498
I’ve never had a dessert this good before.

623
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:18,699
I never thought that under the burnt surface,

624
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,539
there is deliciousness hidden inside.

625
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:30,699
You’re right. Life is not that bad.

626
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,659
Hey, Weir.

627
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:16,297
Is your life like crème brûlée?

628
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:20,619
What do you mean?

629
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:29,259
I was mean to you in the past.

630
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,978
Am I like the burnt side of your life?

631
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,414
Are you crazy, boss?

632
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:40,409
When we remet,

633
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,409
I didn’t even recognize you.

634
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:46,059
How can you be the burnt side of my life?

635
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,699
You’re actually the sweet side of my life.

636
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:00,458
Sweet, my ass.

637
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:06,409
I’m first one who broke the Gay Conquerer’s heart.

638
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:11,498
How can you be sure you’re the first?

639
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:13,418
What?

640
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:20,139
If not me, then who?

641
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:22,059
Weir.

642
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,090
Eat up.

643
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,690
The police were notified of a child abduction in the middle of last night.

644
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:06,699
The police were notified of a child abduction in the middle of last night.The police found your café bag next to the child’s body.

645
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:11,489
The police found your café bag next to the child’s body.

646
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:11,498
The police found your café bag next to the child’s body.There are 18 missing child cases.

647
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:13,898
There are 18 missing child cases.

648
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:17,739
If we look carefully, we’ll see some connection.

649
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:21,099
If the customers find out our bag was found at the scene,

650
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,409
they will be even more scared to visit our shop.
