00:00:00,494 --> 00:00:03,338
Have you ever loved someone for real?

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:05,259
Yes. There’s one when I was still studying.

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,599
It’s been over 10 years. I didn’t recognize you at first.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,210
According to the results,

8
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:15,009
If I can’t fight, I don’t know what to live for.

9
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,594
Our lives are not that bad.

10
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:19,178
It’s just like this dessert. Just because the outside looks burnt

11
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:21,050
doesn’t mean it tastes bitter inside.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,451
Then let’s team up

13
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,978
to make this café a success.

14
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:25,129
Deal.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,890
I’ve finished a job announcement for our staff.

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:37,899
I’ve finished a job announcement for our staff.WE ARE RECRUITING TWO WAITRESSES.

18
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,219
WE ARE RECRUITING TWO WAITRESSES.

19
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:40,222
WE ARE RECRUITING TWO WAITRESSES.Waitresses?

20
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:41,737
Waitresses?

21
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,978
Of course.

22
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:45,579
This is the uniform. Isn't it cute?

23
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:50,859
I have long dreamed about meeting a beautiful waitress in a maid costume.

24
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,118
Just thinking about it gets me going.

25
00:00:55,658 --> 00:01:00,939
Boss, I may have forgotten to tell you something.

26
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:02,378
What?

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,578
I have a fear of women.

28
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,724
What do you mean?

29
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:15,337
I don’t think I can work with women.

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,578
If our waitstaffs were female, it’d be difficult for me to work.

31
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:26,090
No, the waitstaffs must be female.

32
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:32,617
If I had to work closely with women, I'd shudder like a kitten.

33
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:37,418
I wouldn't be able to bake.

34
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:39,930
No, no, no. You have to fix this.

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,697
Boss.

36
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,019
Don't you have any sympathy for me?

37
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:49,899
Please

38
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,259
Please

39
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:04,778
Fine.

40
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:08,139
You’ve got issues.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,408
WE ARE RECRUITING TWO WAITERS.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,579
There are more of these fliers.

43
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,739
Thank you, Boss.

44
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,419
You’re such a happiness blocker.

CCTV footage captured a potential suspect wearing a red hat.

The only thing cleaner than this is a sterilized room.

57

We’re in a restaurant business.

58

Sanitary is the top priority.

59
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:06,699
Chef,

60
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,810
please let me be your protégé.

61
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:15,819
I want to make delicious desserts like you.

62
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,288
I’m willing to do anything you tell me to.

63
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,619
You could have your way with me if that’s what it takes.

64
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:23,290
Stop right now.

65
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,899
What, Uncle? Let go of me.

66
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,697
Bro, who’s this uncle you called out for?

67
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:30,699
Bro, who’s this uncle you called out for?It’s obvious there’s only one uncle here.

68
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,519
It’s obvious there’s only one uncle here.

69
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,019
If not uncle, do you want me to call you grandpa?

70
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,858
Well, this is the owner.

71
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:46,059
Oh,

72
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,379
hello, Uncle Who Owns the Café.

73
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,579
Hello.

74
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,459
Get out of my café right this second.

75
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,819
No, I’m not going anywhere until you hire me.

76
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,540
Who would want to work with an insane person like you?

77
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,545
Who would want to work with an insane person like you?I do.

78
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,699
I do.

79
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,216
Hi, I’m Krating – Tadtep Udommana.

80
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,098
I’m 23 years old, 171 cm, and 60 kg.

81
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,499
What about your education?

82
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,418
Which university did you go to?

83
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,740
I didn't go to a university.

84
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:27,747
I didn't go to a university.I finished my high school education.

85
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,259
I finished my high school education.

86
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,620
Even if I told you the school’s name, you wouldn’t have heard of it.

87
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,149
Your work experience?

88
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,149
I’ve been a boxer since middle school.

89
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,778
I was going for a championship title,

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,879
but then I was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm.

91
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,939
I can never box again for the rest of my life.

92
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:02,379
But now, I want to switch careers.

93
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,778
I want to be as good as you at baking.

94
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:09,576
Bro, why would I hire you?

95
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,016
If you don’t hire me,

96
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,762
I’ll come here every day waiting outside

97
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:15,778
until you hire me, Uncle.

98
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:15,781
until you hire me, Uncle.I think you watch too much Chinese action historical drama.

99
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:19,177
I think you watch too much Chinese action historical drama.

100
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:22,057
Why do you want to bake, may I ask?

101
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,338
Besides boxing, the only thing I like is desserts.

102
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,737
I had a bite of your dessert yesterday.

103
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:32,838
It gave me a purpose in life again.

104
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,978
I want to make yummy desserts as you do.

105
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:41,257
I can hardly believe how much impact a piece of dessert has on me.

106
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:43,177
That’s why I want to bake.

107
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:47,497
I want to bake desserts that make people feel the way I felt.

108
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,858
But our café wants a waiter,

109
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,737
not an assistant chef.

110
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,016
May I do a test?

111
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,418
Have a bite and give me your critique.

112
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,069
The flour is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

113
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:31,072
The flour is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.The more you chew, the tastier it gets.

114
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:32,697
The more you chew, the tastier it gets.

115
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:35,018
The custard filling is smooth and mellow.

116
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:39,817
The vanilla extract is pure not imitation flavor. Is that right?

117
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,570
Please hire him, boss.

118
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:45,576
Please hire him, boss.He’s got talent.

119
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:47,485
He’s got talent.

120
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,856
He may not have the fundamental skills, but I can help with that.

121
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,258
No.

122
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,057
I need someone to taste my baking.

123
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,418
If you don’t hire him,

124
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,298
you’ll need to do the tasting.

125
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,470
What if he fell in love with you and destroy my café?

126
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,976
That sounds ridiculous, Uncle.

127
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:15,808
Bro, you haven’t got a clue.

128
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:15,817
Bro, you haven’t got a clue.This guy has made his colleagues fall in love and ruin a lot of businesses.

129
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:21,096
This guy has made his colleagues fall in love and ruin a lot of businesses.

130
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,498
I don't think this will be the case.

131
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,856
How do you know?

132
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,470
There’s no spark.

133
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,138
And he’s not my type.

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,864
It will not happen here.

135
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:52,298
More importantly, he's not into guys, right?

136
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,177
I like girls.

137
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,378
Please.

138
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,298
Please, boss.

139
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,138
Fine.

140
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,018
Three months probation.

141
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,897
Yay!

142
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,817
Thank you so much, chef.

143
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,177
What are you so happy about?

144
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,538
Thanks a lot, Uncle.

145
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:28,778
Probation period for 3 months.

146
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,658
I'll do my best.

147
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,096
Do you want a higher grade?

148
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:07,177
That’s OK. Relax. Don’t be afraid.

149
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,018
No need to be afraid.

150
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,738
It's OK. Just relax.

151
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:25,418
Hey!

152
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,177
Sorry, auntie.

153
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:40,581
I’ve sent through the pictures, dear.

154
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,379
Caught red-handed.

155
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,976
A male teacher harasses a student in the classroom.

156
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:47,976
The incident takes place at a prestigious private school in the city.

157
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:50,269
Phueak Nae has received intel from our follower

158
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,816
that the teacher has committed this offense on male students repeatedly.

159
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:58,538
But the victims didn't come forward for fear of getting an F or NP.

160
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:02,850
Our page sends in an investigator to dig deep right away.

161
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:02,856
Our page sends in an investigator to dig deep right away.We’ve obtained solid evidence that will convict this depraved teacher.

163
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,618

We hope the authority will take this forward.

165
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:14,378
Once you dig, you need to go all the way.

166
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,817
Great.

167
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,216
Guys, Plueak Nae has just posted something.

168
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,618
Does he really harass students?

169
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:24,408
Do you think that’s him?

170
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:24,416
Do you think that’s him?Look.

171
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,898
Look.

172
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,205
That’s right. It’s him.

173
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:28,206
That’s right. It’s him.Yes.

174
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,738
Yes.

175
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,658
How can he do this?

176
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:42,216

Excellent. We will definitely reach a million.

180
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,933
It’s great that a large number of people will see this.

181
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,649
It will make this big news,

182
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:55,658
It will make this big news,and the police will get involved.

183
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,019
and the police will get involved.

184
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:58,028
and the police will get involved.It's sad that this kind of news has to be trending on social media

185
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:02,139
It's sad that this kind of news has to be trending on social media

186
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:02,147
It's sad that this kind of news has to be trending on social mediabefore somebody takes action.

187
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,730
before somebody takes action.

188
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,177
Hence, our page Phueak Nae.

189
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,538
What’s next? What will dig into next?

190
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,678
How about we dig into the death of Fat Cat,

191
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:12,687
How about we dig into the death of Fat Cat,a resident cat of a prestigious school in Chiang Mai.

192
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,817
a resident cat of a prestigious school in Chiang Mai.

193
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:20,138
I don’t think he died from eating too much.

194
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,913
Someone must’ve poisoned him.

195
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:22,918
Someone must’ve poisoned him.My spidey sense is tingling.

196
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,235
My spidey sense is tingling.

197
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,945
What about this?

198
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:28,298
A socialite drunk drove and crashed through a checkpoint.

199
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:29,738
I think that’s good.

200
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:32,138
But I think we should to this story.

201
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:36,368
Lately, there have been many cases of missing children.

202
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:40,115
Most of them are homeless or street vendors.

203
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,052
Nobody cares to report this on the news.

204
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:46,760
I think there is the perpetrator of these cases are the same person.

205
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,730
Come on, madam.

206
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:51,735
Come on, madam.That was a long time ago.

207
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:54,154
That was a long time ago.

208
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:57,576
Don't mix current work with the past.

209
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,898
It's not our fault.

210
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,778
Can you please tell me what this is about, Dad?

211
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,538
Your mom and I quit our jobs as reporters

212
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:14,301
because we made a huge mistake.

213
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:18,216
Back then, we received intel about missing children.

214
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,519
But we didn’t pay attention.

215
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:20,524
But we didn’t pay attention.We were focusing on a celebrity getting knocked up out of wedlock

216
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:23,767
We were focusing on a celebrity getting knocked up out of wedlock

217
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,418
that was trending then.

218
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:31,168
When we were about to get back to the missing children, it was too late.

219
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:31,177
When we were about to get back to the missing children, it was too late.A child was found dead by the side of the road.

220
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:35,976
A child was found dead by the side of the road.

221
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:43,658
Since then, I’ve always felt that I had a part

222
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:46,057
in causing that child’s death.

223
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:51,336
Let’s do this news then.

224
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:57,576
Both of you created this page because of this.

225
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:03,820
It’s our job to help those neglected by mainstream media.

226
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:08,618
That mistake will not be repeated.

227
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,418
If so,

228
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,778
let’s do our best on this piece of news.

229
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,216

Bye.

243
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,658
Little Girl.

244
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,538
Would you want some dessert?

245
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,456
Would you like some?

246
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,378
Would you like some?

247
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,216
Would you want some dessert?

248
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,057
No.

249
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,450
Do you want some balloons? You can have the balloons.

250
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,456
Do you want some balloons? You can have the balloons.No, I don’t want it.

251
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:15,336
No, I don’t want it.

252
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,450
This place is doomed.

253
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,418
Wow.

254
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,629
I’m preparing a flour mix for madeleines

255
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,658
or, as the Thais call, ma-de-lene.

256
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:22,057
Try it, Krating.

257
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:24,490
Me?

258
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:26,856
Taste it.

259
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:32,615
Wow.

260
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,856
Boss,

261
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:43,172
I’ve made lemon raspberry madeleines for you to give out.

262
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:43,178

263
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:44,928
This will make our café well known.

264
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:47,017
Great. I’ll take care of it.

265
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:48,991
Free samples right here.

266
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:50,856
Come get one before they run out.

267
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,778
Here is a free sample.

268
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,490
I can just take one, right?

269
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,498
I can just take one, right?But if you want,

270
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,002
But if you want,

271
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,538
care to take a photo with the handsome owner that is me?

272
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,153
I’m good.

273
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:06,078
Sorry. Our owner is quite playful.

274
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:02,153
I’m good.Sorry. Our owner is quite playful.

275
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,656
He’s not serious.

276
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,096
Please take two.

277
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,458
But I was not playing. I’m serious.

278
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:14,856
Please take a photo.

279
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,738
Maybe next time.

280
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:20,136
Oh, OK.

281
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:25,896
Chef, I think we’re heading there.

282
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:27,670
Where?

283
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:27,673
Where?Towards a new job.

284
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:29,568
Towards a new job.

285
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:29,574
Towards a new job.I give it 3 months before we close down

286
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,923
I give it 3 months before we close down

287
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,576
with this kind of owner.

288
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:35,978
He’s a creep.

289
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:39,817
Think of it as a gimmick.

290
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:45,096
Intel says the kid was last seen in this area.

291
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,416
Crumbs of strawberry cake were found here.

292
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:55,656
The kid and the suspect walked past here before they vanished.

293
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,576
Of course,

294
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,896
this camera is just for show. It doesn’t capture anything.

295
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,178
It could be the reason why the suspect grabbed the kid here.

296
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,576
How long are you going to keep talking to yourself, Mone?

297
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,345
Im, you startled me sneaking up on me like that.

298
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,258
I’ve been listening to you talking to yourself for almost 10 minutes.

299
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,355
How long are you going to keep playing detective?

300
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:23,018
You've been doing it since elementary school. Now, you’re 22.

301
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,856
I'm doing my job, not playing.

302
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,512
A normal person would meet up with their friend at a mall or a café.

303
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:35,719
But you told me to meet at a crime scene.

304
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:40,298
I'm working on a child abduction case.

305
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:44,134
Oh, what about that sexual predator/teacher?

306
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,576
What did he get?

307
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,140
He just got transferred.

308
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,146
He just got transferred.What?

309
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,458
What?

310
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,098
After what he did, he just got transferred?

311
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:52,298
Yeah.

312
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,136
That teacher should never teach again for the rest of his life.

313
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,057
He doesn’t deserve to be called a teacher.

314
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,978
It defames the whole teaching institution.

315
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:02,376
True. Ah!

316
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,884
Did you get some dessert for me?

317
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:05,887
Did you get some dessert for me?I am starving. Let me eat it to lift up my mood.

318
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:10,057
I am starving. Let me eat it to lift up my mood.

319
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:14,856
Wow! Yummy!

320
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,738
Where did you buy it from? It’s so delicious.

321
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:20,618
I don't think you should go there. The owner is kind of weird.

322
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:22,209
Creepy.

323
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:28,778
Didn’t you say you’d treat me to a meal for doing a piece on that teacher?

324
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:33,576
That gaze and that voice.

325
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,009
I know. I’m here because I want to take you to a buffet.

326
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,298
My treat.

327
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,218
You’re so beautiful today.

328
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,900
I'm beautiful every day.

329
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:43,904
I'm beautiful every day.Let’s go. What do you feel like eating today?

330
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:44,923
Let’s go. What do you feel like eating today?

331
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:49,416
How about BBQ pork? There’s this new place. Looks good.

332
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:44,923
Let’s go. What do you feel like eating today?How about BBQ pork? There’s this new place. Looks good.

333
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,663
Really? How are the reviews?

334
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:51,665
Really? How are the reviews?It’s good.

335
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:52,778
It’s good.

336
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,057
Are you upset because we didn’t have many customers today?

337
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:13,896
Don't be. It's normal for the first day.

338
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:16,528
No.

339
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:16,535
No.I’m upset because no one wanted to take a picture with me.

340
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,656
I’m upset because no one wanted to take a picture with me.

341
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,018
Why? Does our uniform look too bland?

342
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,153
Even with a suit and a tie,

343
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:29,368
a creep like you will scare off all the girls.

344
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:32,136
I’m handsome, attractive, charming.

345
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:33,348
Right?

346
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,017
Yes.

347
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,336
So handsome that I want to pet your cat in your bedroom.

348
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,537
I don't have a cat.

349
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,614
I can be your cat. Meow.

350
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:47,977
Stop it.

351
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,856
Hurry and close up the shop.

352
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,175
I don't think he likes cats.

353
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,298
These are the photos from the crime scene.

354
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,136
I’d like to meet the owner. Is he in?

355
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,938
Is there any problem? I'm the owner.

356
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,336
I have a few questions to ask you.

357
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:42,113
Last night, someone found the body of a child vendor

358
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,618
kidnapped a few days ago.

359
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:49,130
Next to her body was a dessert bag from your café.

360
00:23:51,318 --> 00:23:53,848
MATERIAL EVIDENCE DO NOT MOVE.

361
00:23:57,556 --> 00:24:01,416
Do you know anything about the kidnapped child?

362
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,817
Has there been anything that looks suspicious?

363
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:06,690
Help!

364
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:06,698
Help!Where are you going?

365
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:07,656
Where are you going?

366
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,078
Come and eat the cake!

367
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:12,210
Boss!

368
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,461
Hey!

369
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,180
Boss! What’s wrong?

370
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:17,258
What’s wrong?

371
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:21,576
Boss.

372
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:24,938
Boss.

373
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:27,815
Boss.

374
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,258
Are you awake?

375
00:24:32,894 --> 00:24:34,057
Whoa!

376
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,738
Why didn’t you take me to the hospital?

377
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,136
I was thinking…

378
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,498
If you didn’t come to, I’d do mouth-to-mouth.

379
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,376
I passed out. I didn’t drown.

380
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,690
Kidding.

381
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,390
You looked like a puppy when you were out.

382
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,397
You looked like a puppy when you were out.I just wanted to tease you.

383
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:54,787
I just wanted to tease you.

384
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:56,295
What are we going to do about the police?

385
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:56,297
What are we going to do about the police?If people knew our dessert was found at the crime scene,

386
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:59,498
If people knew our dessert was found at the crime scene,

387
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:01,605
people wouldn’t dare come in.

388
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:04,778
They might even suspect you.

389
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,182
You do look like a murderer.

390
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:10,537
Is this guy essential to our shop?

391
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:10,538
Is this guy essential to our shop?I’m going to fire him.

392
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:11,498
I’m going to fire him.

393
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:14,250
Don’t, Boss. Have compassion for him.

394
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:15,930
Where’s the compassion for me?

395
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:19,502
Chef, how are your legs?

396
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:19,506
Chef, how are your legs?Uncle slept on your legs for a long time.

397
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:22,788
Uncle slept on your legs for a long time.

398
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,759
An old guy usually takes a long nap.

399
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:24,761
An old guy usually takes a long nap.See what he’s doing?

400
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,376
See what he’s doing?

401
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,118
Have compassion for him, please.

402
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,218
Have compassion for me!

403
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:33,756
Chef, I’m going to get fired.

404
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:34,920
Chef, please.

405
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:39,817
The child vendor who was missing a few days ago that we talked about…

406
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,698
They found her. Look.

407
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,192
She was found dead by the side of the road last night.

408
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:47,498
Look.

409
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,920
Do the police have any suspects yet?

410
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,218
They said they got no leads.

411
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,498
No evidence or witnesses that will lead to the perpetrator.

412
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:00,845
Dad! Mom!

413
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:02,856
What is it, dear?

414
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,218
I think I’ve found something.

415
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:11,914
Over the past 6 months in Bangkok,

416
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:14,856
there are a total of 18 cases of missing children.

417
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:19,971
Two were later found dead.

418
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,759
One was homeless, the other was a beggar.

419
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,856
The latest victim is a street vendor.

420
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,656
If we look closely, we can see a connection

421
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:34,538
that looks too similar to be a coincidence.

422
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:39,817
All 3 victims were 10-12 years old.

423
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:44,616
They were marginalized and neglected.

424
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:50,376
They all died of the same cause: an overdose.

425
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,136
If it’s not a coincidence,

426
00:26:58,028 --> 00:27:00,938
but a serial killer.

427
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:06,217
If that’s the case,

428
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:09,096
there will more victims.

429
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,250
Do you really think so?

430
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:16,759
In that case, let me call Lt. Somphong.

431
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,178
I’ll see what I can find out from him.

432
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,778
Here you go, Boss. Have some tea.

433
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,136
Chamomile tea can help you feel better.

434
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,018
I’m fine.

435
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:51,336
Have a sip.

436
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:55,175
It’s your afternoon tea.

437
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,576
I don’t eat pastry.

438
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,576
I’ll eat it.

439
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,738
Mmm.

440
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:08,616
Don’t make that face. I’m not eating it.

441
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,538
I’m taking the whole thing then.

442
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,416
I can sip the tea.

443
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,856
Hot.

444
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:23,498
Uncle, I’m curious. Why did you pass out?

445
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,416
No answer.

446
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:40,298
Seriously, what’s wrong with you?

447
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:49,416
Krating, I think we should continue our baking lessons.

448
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:51,336
Yes, Chef.

449
00:29:11,787 --> 00:29:14,289
Today, we’re making Choux à la Crème

450
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:17,258
Or, as most people call, choux cream.

451
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:22,057
Let me demonstrate it to you and you can be my assistant.

452
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:23,497
Yes, Chef.

453
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:26,856
First, we start with choux pastry.

454
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:36,892
Normally, they use water or milk in the mix.

455
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,336
In our recipe, we add this.

456
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,200
The texture is smooth and rising,

457
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,218
which are key to choux pastry.

458
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,914
The important thing is to remove moisture

459
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:11,651
and decrease the dough temperature

460
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:14,376
to avoid cooking the eggs.

461
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,258
Take it to the oven.

462
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,088
Have a bite.

463
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,616
I’m going to.

464
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:04,778
So delicious!

465
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,730
You eat like a child.

466
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:35,498
Krating.

467
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:44,136
Free samples for beautiful customers.

468
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:51,817
The police found dessert packaging at the crime scene.

469
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,220
It’s from this shop.

470
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,135
Hello,

471
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,420
here are some free samples. Please try some.

472
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,421
here are some free samples. Please try some.If you like it, please buy more inside.

473
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:02,376
If you like it, please buy more inside.

474
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,778
Thank you.

475
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:07,714
It’s so cute.

476
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:11,498
And yummy too. My chef put all his effort into it.

477
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,855
Where did you buy it from? It’s so delicious.

478
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:19,178
Police found dessert packaging at the crime scene.

479
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,502
It’s from this shop.

480
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,528
I don't think you should go there.

481
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:24,710
The owner is kind of weird.

482
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,711
The owner is kind of weird.Creepy.

483
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,376
Creepy.

484
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,258
Dad, Mom, here’s my theory.

485
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,367
On the night of the kidnapping,

486
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:47,018
the perpetrator lured the child with a cake and kidnapped her.

487
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:53,258
The following day was Sweet Day’s first opening day.

488
00:33:53,961 --> 00:34:00,458
The shop held a campaign to give out madeleines to people walking by.

489
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:04,778
Here it is.

490
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:08,617
On the night the police found the missing child’s body,

491
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,978
a bag from Sweet Day was on the ground.

492
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:18,697
That means the perpetrator must have come here.

493
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:24,458
Here you are.

494
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:28,594
Sweet Day Afternoon Tea Set. Please enjoy.

495
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,735
Thank you.

496
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,456
Is there something wrong, miss?

497
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,856
You’ve been looking at me.

498
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:42,697
Or?

499
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,898
You must want to take a photo with me to check-in.

500
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,177
Let’s try the desserts.

501
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:04,777
So good.

502
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,927
Did you make this yourself?

503
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,538
Our chef makes it.

504
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:13,706
Oh. This tastes so good.

505
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:16,297
Excuse me, may I see the chef?

506
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:18,177
Sure.

507
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:20,137
Weir, Krating,

508
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:22,056
come here.

509
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:57,097
What’s up, Uncle?

510
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,260
Our customers want to meet the bakers.

511
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,338
Everyone.

512
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:18,592
The pastry is so delicious.

513
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:19,916
Very delicious indeed.

514
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:21,795
Attractive and charming.

515
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,498
You’re talking about the pastry, right?

516
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:28,297
Of course. The pastry looks really good, beautiful.

517
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,697
With delicious desserts, you must be selling very well.

518
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:33,280
That would be nice.

519
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,978
But I don’t know if the customers will stay away

520
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,842
because of the recent news about a murdered child.

521
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:38,860
No!

522
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:47,498
Please excuse him. His intelligence is not as good as his looks.

523
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,378
I’ve heard the news.

524
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:54,217
Many children have been kidnapped from this area.

525
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:57,349
It’s possible that the perpetrator has come to this shop.

526
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,355
It’s possible that the perpetrator has come to this shop.Have you met anyone suspicious or a stranger?

527
00:36:57,355 --> 00:37:01,853
Have you met anyone suspicious or a stranger?

528
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,063
I’ve met one.

529
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:07,050
This is the strangest man I’ve met in this neighborhood.

530
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:11,900
Krating, come here.

531
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,898
You are a strange man.

532
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,378
Come here.

533
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,530
Great pastry, dear.

534
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,452
The chef is so charming.

535
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:25,818
You’re right. He’s good-looking with wonderful baking skills.

536
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:27,452
Should we go back and eat more?

537
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:31,177
Dad, Mom, you guys can head home.

538
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:36,938
I’m going to check out the neighborhood to find some leads.

539
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,257
There is something strange about this café,

540
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:44,617
especially the owner.

541
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:47,498
When I was talking about the kidnapping news,

542
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,896
he was acting really weird.

543
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:52,780
My spidey sense is tingling.

544
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:58,056
This means that Phueak Nae is onto the next piece of news.

545
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:02,858
My gut instinct is never wrong.

546
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:11,978
Be careful.

547
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,094
Bye.

548
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:23,302
If the killer lived around here as the customer said,

549
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,418
it would make this neighborhood very dangerous.

550
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,777
Be careful on your way home, Chef.

551
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,974
Do you only care about Weir? What about me?

552
00:38:32,974 --> 00:38:35,978
With that face, there’s no need to worry about you.

553
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:37,614
I see.

554
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:41,233
You’re saying that I look like someone who can take care of himself.

555
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,150
No.

556
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,152
No.If the killer saw your face, they’d think you're his pal.

557
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,097
If the killer saw your face, they’d think you're his pal.

558
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:48,458
You missed.

559
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,458
Do you ever see me as your boss?

560
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:54,697
If I spent too much time with you, I’d have a stroke.

561
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,697
I think it’s cute.

562
00:38:57,197 --> 00:38:59,498
Which part is cute? Krating is a bull from hell.

563
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,858
I meant you, Boss. You’re cute.

564
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,577
One person disrespects me, the other flirts with me.

565
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:11,978
Insane.

566
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:13,418
Are you shy?

567
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,344
Stop, you murderer!

568
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,219
What?

569
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,693
Don’t run!

570
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:47,978
Catch him!

571
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,378
Catch this guy!

572
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,016
Are you the killer who kidnapped that child?

573
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:00,458
I’ve done my research.

574
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:04,222
Six months ago, a lot of kids were missing from this area.

575
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:07,177
All of a sudden, Sweet Day is open right here.

576
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:11,978
The police found a bag from this cafe at the crime scene.

577
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,199
You and the owner are in on it together, right?

578
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,737
You two are killers/kidnappers.

579
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:19,177
In on it together?

580
00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:21,340
Killers? What?

581
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,443
You and Uncle worked together to murder a child.

582
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:27,338
Yes. The owner looks very suspicious.

583
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:28,297
What?

584
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,039
He looks like a murderer.

585
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,085
Chef, stay away from psycho Uncle. He’s a murderer.

586
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:36,936
Wait. Hear me out. I’m not a murderer.

587
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,909
This guy is my bodyguard.

588
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:40,297
Huh?

589
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,097
Young Master, my tummy hurts.

590
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,418
My name is Pooh.

591
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:04,777
I’m Young Master Punn’s personal bodyguard.

592
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,809
I’ve been following him since the opening because

593
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:09,811
I’ve been following him since the opening becauseI’m worried about him.

594
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,978
I’m worried about him.

595
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:16,297
I had to hide it because I was afraid it’d make Young Master uncomfortable.

596
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:21,099
Why did you have to sneak around behind his back?

597
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,458
I just wanted to help him throw out the trash.

598
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,860
I had to sneak around

599
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:29,257
because I didn’t want him to find out I’d been following him.

600
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,538
It seemed like you were reaching for something.

601
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:41,565
I was only reaching for a handkerchief for Young Master.

602
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,097
I noticed he got a drop of sweat.

603
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:48,458
I thought he was exhausted.

604
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:53,257
Young Master and I are not murderers.

605
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:03,338
That’s enough. Stop crying.

606
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,329
You’re embarrassing yourself.

607
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:09,577
I’m sorry, Pooh, for the misunderstanding.

608
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:14,858
But the owner does look suspicious.

609
00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:16,858
How would you know?

610
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,657
Do you know me well?

611
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:23,422
I don't look good just on the outside.

612
00:42:23,422 --> 00:42:25,422
The inside is golden as well.

613
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,818
Uncle,

614
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,657
are you defending yourself or praising yourself?

615
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,458
If you want to get to know me better,

616
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:39,338
do you want to go out with me?

617
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,217
That’s fine. I’m good.

618
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:45,577
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

619
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:49,418
But I want everyone to be on their guard

620
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:53,257
as I’m sure a murderer is lurking around here somewhere.

621
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:56,137
But it’s not me.

622
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:00,460
I understand that now.

623
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,699
Let’s eat cake.

624
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:44,137
Why would you hire someone like that to be a bodyguard?

625
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:46,282
It's the only thing he can do.

626
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:49,010
Because you’re so cute. How can I resist?

627
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,657
How could you do that to Pooh?
