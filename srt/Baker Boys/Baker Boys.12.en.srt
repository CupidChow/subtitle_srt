Teacher Toomtam!

13
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:34,015
My mom and I are the sweet murderers.

14
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,112
Though you’re teacher Im Aim’s friend,

15
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:43,856
you’re not an exception.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,671
Our home usually welcomes kids only.

17
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:58,223
We’re not welcoming a boring grown-up woman like you.

18
00:00:58,335 --> 00:00:59,487
But you stick your nose in.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,887
You invade our home’s privacy.

20
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:03,472
I don’t like it!

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,688
Not yet, son.

22
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:10,927
It’s not yet time.

23
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,176
Nana?

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,152
Why are you crying?

25
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:24,480
Nana.

26
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,391
Nana.

27
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,367
Let me go!

28
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:30,191
I won’t hurt you, Nana.

29
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,007
Nana.

30
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:34,519
Don’t cry.

31
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:34,528
Don’t cry.No!

32
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,599
No!

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,055
Let me go!

34
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,849
Nana, do you want to eat a cake?

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:39,855
Nana, do you want to eat a cake?I’ll bring it to you.

36
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,007
I’ll bring it to you.

37
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,560
Why are you two doing this?

38
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:44,969
Why did you kidnap kids to kill them here?

39
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:44,975
Why did you kidnap kids to kill them here?Not to kill!

40
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,048
Not to kill!

41
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:48,640
I’m bringing kids here just to play with them.

42
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:50,048
You know nothing, so shut up.

43
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,391
My son just wants to stay with a kid who loves to smile.

44
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,471
Lively and lovely. That’s it.

45
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:56,768
You’re right, mom.

46
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,304
I feel happiest when seeing kids smile.

47
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,463
I don’t know why this kid doesn’t want to smile.

48
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,584
I gave her desserts

49
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,487
and played with her.

50
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,192
Still, she doesn’t smile.

51
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,039
I feel so sorry for a kid like her.

52
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,879
Let me go!

53
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:15,888
Let me go!This type of kid shouldn’t even exist in this world.

54
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:17,551
This type of kid shouldn’t even exist in this world.

55
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,728
Don’t hurt me!

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,584
Is that why you killed those kids?

57
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:23,391
Just because of this, huh?

58
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,831
Don’t insult my son!

59
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,127
He doesn’t do anything wrong.

60
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:29,360
He likes kids.

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,460
He likes staying with kids.

62
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,463
He likes staying with kids.He loves them.

63
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:31,312
He loves them.

64
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,479
I want to see kids smile cheerfully every day.

65
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,280
That’s why I became a teacher.

66
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:38,939
Let me go!

67
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:38,943
Let me go!I had been waiting for Mesa for ages,

68
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,496
I had been waiting for Mesa for ages,

69
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,575
but she never smiled again after she ran away from our home.

70
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:46,864
Go away!

71
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,008
But Mesa gave me some luck

72
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,656
since I got to meet the loveliest girl here.

73
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:56,650
Nana?

74
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,759
Let go of her, you psycho!

75
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:58,768
Let go of her, you psycho!Don’t you see she’s scared to death?!

76
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:00,544
Don’t you see she’s scared to death?!

77
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:02,879
Shut up!

78
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,328
Nana, don’t cry.

79
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,360
Stay still, Nana.

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,848
I’ll bring you a cake to eat.

81
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:17,711
No!

THE LAST PIECE OF DESSERT

89
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,216
Is there something wrong, Krating?

90
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,567
I don’t know why Mone suddenly pranked me like this,

91
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,144
and told me that the sweet murder kidnapped her.

92
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,600
I think you should call her back.

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,312
I did,

94
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:32,040
but her phone is off.

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,048
but her phone is off.I don’t know whether it’s just a prank

96
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:33,632
I don’t know whether it’s just a prank

97
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,629
because she pranked me often these days.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,375
What did Mone tell you?

99
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,576
Say it again.

100
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,624
She phoned,

101
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,504
telling me that the sweet murderer kidnapped her

102
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:44,783
around our café.

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,744
What else?

104
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:53,151
She mentioned the sweet murderer came to our café earlier today.

105
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:54,367
What?

106
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:57,149
The murderer came here?

107
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,728
Who could it be?

108
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,139
That’s why I don’t believe her.

109
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:02,144
That’s why I don’t believe her.Krating, sometimes we can't tell a book by its cover.

110
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:05,680
Krating, sometimes we can't tell a book by its cover.

111
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,800
But why did she choose to call me?

112
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,992
Why didn’t she call the police instead?

113
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,759
Probably, she got tied?

114
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,040
Or she might be in the situation which prevents her from using her phone normally,

115
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,250
But then it happened that you’re the only person she could call.

116
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,255
But then it happened that you’re the only person she could call.Mone once said that she will find any possible way to catch the murderer.

117
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Mone once said that she will find any possible way to catch the murderer.

118
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,055
She seemed so serious about it.

119
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:32,367
I think you’d better contact Mone’s parents as soon as possible.

120
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,560
She’s probably in danger now.

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,552
Mone!

122
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:42,672
Mone!

123
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,639
I’ll go check upstairs.

124
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:43,648
I’ll go check upstairs.Alright.

125
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,463
Alright.

126
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,423
Mone!

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,336
Mone!

128
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:47,728
Mone!

129
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:49,959
There’s nobody upstairs.

130
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:49,968
There’s nobody upstairs.What should we do then?

131
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:50,839
What should we do then?

132
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:50,848
What should we do then?What if something bad happens to her?

133
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,360
What if something bad happens to her?

134
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,367
What if something bad happens to her?Wait. Relax.

135
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,920
Wait. Relax.

136
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,160
Our daughter is cool and smart.

137
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,208
She will manage to get by for sure.

138
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,072
Alright.

139
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,959
I’ll go see Lieutenant Somphong.

140
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:01,968
I’ll go see Lieutenant Somphong.Maybe he could help us.

141
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,168
Maybe he could help us.

142
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,509
Stay here.

143
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:04,512
Stay here.I’ll hurry back here.

144
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:05,951
I’ll hurry back here.

145
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,728
Alright.

146
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,247
Hello?	Krating,

147
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,959
can you do me a favor?

148
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:20,863
Here you are.

149
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:23,072
These are all the files from our café’s CCTV.

150
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:24,192
Thanks.

151
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:25,935
Don’t worry.

152
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:29,536
We will help searching for Mone the best we can.

153
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,591
But now how can we know who the murderer is?

154
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:39,696
Mone mentioned that the murderer came her,

155
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:42,944
so it means she has already identified the murderer.

156
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:45,903
The murderer must have been here before,

157
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,463
or maybe the murderer is your regular customer.

158
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:05,120
Sister?

159
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,375
Hey, they didn’t hurt you, right?

160
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:18,064
That brother untied me

161
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,432
because I agreed to eat the cake with him.

162
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,240
I had been begging him not to hit you.

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
I was afraid you would be hurt.

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,391
I’m alright.

165
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,512
Will we be able to go home?

166
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,463
I miss my parents.

167
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,927
We will for sure.

168
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:54,192
My family and my friends will definitely manage to rescue us.

169
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,480
Don’t lose hope yet.

170
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:02,208
I’m sure we can get out of here.

171
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:08,288
It’s alright.

172
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:11,983
It’s alright.

173
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:23,040
Found!

174
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:23,920
Who?

175
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,567
The 12th suspect.

176
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,136
That walking gesture is strange.

177
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:27,968
This person looks suspicious.

178
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:29,728
Krating,

179
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:31,439
go back and take some rest.

180
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,440
I will do it.

181
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:35,440
You didn’t get any sleep last night, did you?

182
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:37,871
I can’t.

183
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,687
I must find where Mone is.

184
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,120
If I had believed her since that day,

185
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,231
we could have found her now.

186
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,528
Don’t think like that.

187
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,384
It’s not your fault, Krating.

188
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,379
Baby Pig?

189
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,128
Tiwa?

190
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:02,120
We’re here to help, Pooh Bear.

191
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:06,703
I didn’t expect that you would also come, Tiwa.

192
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:09,312
You sacrificed your work time to help us.

193
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:11,967
What kind of person do you think I am?

194
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,176
There’s a missing person, so I must help.

195
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,624
On the day that Mone disappeared,

196
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,895
was there anyone who looked suspicious?

197
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:21,775
Or did Mone act somewhat strange?

198
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,519
It seemed she was looking for someone.

199
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,879
That day I didn’t continue talking to her either.

200
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,471
When I turned around, 	she had already disappeared.

201
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:34,048
I didn’t notice anything either.

202
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:39,535
Customers who came here that day were all our regular customers.

203
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,576
Don’t give up yet.

204
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,029
There must be one among them who is the murderer.

205
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:55,615
Can Mr. Tert help take a look at the CCTV files for us, please?

206
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,128
He is the only person who can identify the murderer.

207
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:01,744
Please don’t let him do it.

208
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,648
Since that day, his condition has become worse and worse.

209
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,288
I do apologize.

210
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:13,679
Mrs. Nuan,

211
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:16,080
please help us.

212
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:20,192
Now, I understand how both of you felt

213
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,951
when your kid went missing.

214
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,032
Please.

215
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:27,823
I’m begging you.

216
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:29,471
Please help our daughter.

217
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:30,799
Please.

218
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,799
Please.

219
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:33,888
But…

220
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,840
I’ll help you.

221
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,792
Tert?

222
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:49,663
This murderer is probably the murderer who kidnapped our kid.

223
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:53,552
Thank you.

224
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,864
It’s dessert time.

225
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,096
This café’s desserts are tasty.

226
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,111
Why does it have to be this dessert café?

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,775
Why?

228
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,480
Actually, I have bought desserts from this café since it still belonged to the former owner.

229
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,456
Their desserts usually make kids happy.

230
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,607
They make kids smile.

231
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,735
Such a lovely kid you are.

232
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,984
Nana, eat this cake.

233
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,128
Eat it, Nana.

234
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:58,336
Nana, eat it.

235
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:00,464
I told you to eat.

236
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,831
I told you to eat it,	so eat!

237
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,351
I bought it for you.

238
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:07,663
I told you to eat!

239
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,309
Teacher Toomtam,

240
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:11,312
Teacher Toomtam,how can you make her smile by doing like that?

241
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:13,360
how can you make her smile by doing like that?

242
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:16,032
If you want her to smile,

243
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,072
then feed her gently.

244
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:26,895
Eat this cake.

245
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,543
Good girl, Nana.

246
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:40,539
Is it yummy?

247
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,344
How long have your mom and you been doing this?

248
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,368
I want to know.

249
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,039
I have been following up on the sweet murderer for ages.

250
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,240
You’re so smart.

251
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,927
Nobody could get onto you.

252
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,783
I actually started doing this since my mom brought me here.

253
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,600
Are you saying that you’re not her son by blood?

254
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:19,855
Yes.

255
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,296
I was an abandoned child whom nobody paid attention to.

256
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,375
Mom adopted me.

257
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:27,951
She takes care of me very well.

258
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,711
She bought me cakes to eat.

259
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:33,279
I’m disciplined, unlike other kids.

260
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:40,432
Do you mean your mom also kidnapped other kids?

261
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

262
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,048
But I understand her.

263
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,336
She just wants to play with other kids.

264
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,368
She wants to see kids happy.

265
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,008
She wants to see their smiles.

266
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,000
Smile.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,991
What are you building?

268
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:09,104
A highway.

269
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,751
Cover the ground for me.

270
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,960
Do it.

271
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,096
She’s brought kids here to make them happy.

272
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,600
She said nothing in this world is as happiest as seeing kids smile and laugh.

273
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,696
I also want another younger sibling,

274
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,216
so we have been trying to search for a kid who can understand our happiness.

275
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,423
We want a kid who wants to smile

276
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,679
and is happy to stay with mom like I am.

277
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,679
Let’s eat this cake.

278
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:51,399
Eat.

279
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,504
But no kids understood us.

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,351
I told you to eat this cake!

281
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,648
Eat!

282
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,120
Eat now!

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
They kept crying. That’s so annoying.

284
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:05,183
We even gave them tasty desserts to eat!

285
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,783
Eat!

286
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,711
Eat it!

287
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:10,539
Eat!

288
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:10,543
Eat!Those kids were insane.
Eat more.

289
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,823
Those kids were insane.
Eat more.

290
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:13,567
Put your hand down.

291
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,399
Unhappy kids they were.
I told you to eat!

292
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,480
They’re not supposed to be in this world.

293
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,528
So, mom and I allowed them to eat the cake happily first.

294
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,120
Then, we made them fall asleep forever.

295
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,912
Teacher Toomtam,

296
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:44,975
I know that you love your mom a lot.

297
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:51,984
But what she did to you and to other kids is not right.

298
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,720
It’s impossible to force anyone to be part of our family.

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,871
More importantly, it’s impossible for kids to smile happily

300
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
if they’re detained like this.

301
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Imagine that these kids can go play in the playground,

302
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,384
meet friends at school and have fun with kids their age.

303
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,296
How happy will they be?

304
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,624
That’s what you want, isn’t it?

305
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,200
You must best understand kids.

306
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,144
Shut up!

307
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,264
Don’t confuse my son.

308
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:40,912
You’re making him misunderstand!

309
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:43,631
Mom.

310
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,152
Toomtam, don’t listen to anyone.

311
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,288
Nobody understands us.

312
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,320
Only we two understand each other.

313
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,368
You’re my good boy, right?

314
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,327
Yes, mom.

315
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,488
I’m your good boy.

316
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,663
I’ll let you go home today then.

317
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,663
I’ll bring you a dessert to eat before you leave.

318
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,375
Have you found anything, Mr. Tert?

319
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,263
Hey, I reported it to the police,

320
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,144
asking them to help find where Mone last used her phone.

321
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,327
But they said they must proceed according to the investigation procedure.

322
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,663
That will take too long.

323
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,016
What if our daughter gets hurt?

324
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,880
Her survival chance is getting lower, right?

325
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,039
Yes, quite so.

326
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,000
This person.

327
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,192
She is the murderer!

328
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:15,791
Which one?

329
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,423
She doesn’t look familiar.

330
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:28,864
Sure.	Thank you very much.

331
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,223
How is it going?

332
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,096
Mr. Manop said he has found the picture of the murderer.

333
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,688
That’s Miss Karn, our regular customer.

334
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:53,759
I remember she told me that her house is near our café.

335
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,751
Do you know where her house is?

336
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,240
I don’t know.

337
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,799
I’ll try to search for her around here then.

338
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:05,807
I’ll try to search for her around here then.At least, we now know the murderer’s face.

339
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,400
At least, we now know the murderer’s face.

340
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,407
At least, we now know the murderer’s face.Hey, relax.

341
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,839
Hey, relax.

342
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,950
It’s no use searching around like that.

343
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:11,951
It’s no use searching around like that.What do you want me to do then?

344
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,019
What do you want me to do then?

345
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,023
What do you want me to do then?Do you want me to just sit here and do nothing?

346
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,496
Do you want me to just sit here and do nothing?

347
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,029
Mone could die!

348
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,031
Mone could die!Stop!

349
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:16,576
Stop!

350
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:18,736
This is not time to argue.

351
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,064
Calm down.

352
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,976
I’m sorry.

353
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,624
I was too impatient.

354
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,463
It’s alright.

355
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,544
I understand you.

356
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,071
Is she the person who often ordered our desserts here for take-away?

357
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:38,400
Yes.

358
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:39,951
She bought from us every day.

359
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,511
Garbage bin!

360
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:44,400
What do you mean?

361
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:49,680
There’s a garbage bin put in front of every house in every residence around here.

362
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,112
If the murderer came to buy desserts here almost every day,

363
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:57,930
then the garbage bin in front of her house must be filled with more dessert boxes, than any other house’s bin.

364
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:57,935
then the garbage bin in front of her house must be filled with more dessert boxes, than any other house’s bin.So, the house with the garbage bin filled with lots of our dessert boxes

365
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:01,167
So, the house with the garbage bin filled with lots of our dessert boxes

366
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,519
could be where the murderer lives.

367
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,807
Let’s hurry then.

368
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:15,279
Let’s go.

369
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,384
Help me!

370
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:24,250
Help me!

371
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:24,256
Help me!Anyone, help!

372
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,296
Anyone, help!

373
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:26,829
Help me!

374
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:26,832
Help me!Let me go!

375
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:27,647
Let me go!

376
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,640
Mone, it’s your dessert time.

377
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:39,791
No!

378
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,096
Don’t do this.

379
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,071
You don’t have to do this.

380
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,640
Please eat this dessert,

381
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,352
so you can sleep well.

382
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:54,096
I promise I will make you as happy as the previous kid was.

383
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,344
No!

384
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,759
Teacher Toomtam, you don’t have to do this.

385
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:58,768
Teacher Toomtam, you don’t have to do this.Don’t!

386
00:20:58,768 --> 00:20:59,695
Don’t!

387
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,019
Eat it!	Eat!

388
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:01,023
Eat it!	Eat!Eat!	Let go of me!

389
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:02,288
Eat!	Let go of me!

390
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,039
I told you to eat!	Eat!

391
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,048
I told you to eat!	Eat!Eat now!

392
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:04,928
Eat now!

393
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,400
Eat!

394
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,680
There’s none here.

395
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:27,008
None on this side either.

396
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:32,640
Let’s go.

397
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:00,223
This is…?

398
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:02,943
What should we do, Boss?

399
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,784
Should we call the police?

400
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,240
I think it will be too late if we wait for the police.

401
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,096
Tiwa and Baby Pig,

402
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:13,728
please go back and wait at our café.

403
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,824
Please call the police for us.

404
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,440
Be careful, Pooh.

405
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,855
Let’s go.

406
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:32,256
Press it, Weir.

407
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,344
Don’t come in!

408
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,359
Open it.

409
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,384
Mone!

410
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,551
Mone!

411
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,799
Mone!

412
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,144
Let’s separate and search around.

413
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:58,064
Let’s go, Pooh.

414
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,976
Yes, Young Master.

415
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,183
Get out of my house now.

416
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,519
You have no right to come in.

417
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:13,519
Auntie, please stop.

418
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,250
You can’t come in here.

419
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:16,256
You can’t come in here.This is the house for my son and me.

420
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:17,839
This is the house for my son and me.

421
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,319
You can’t destroy our family!

422
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:21,327
You can’t destroy our family!Leave us alone!

423
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,240
Leave us alone!

424
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,791
Auntie!

425
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,056
Young Master!

426
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,049
Pooh!

427
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:32,400
Pooh!

428
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:37,872
Young Master.

429
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,740
Young Master, are you alright?

430
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:41,743
Young Master, are you alright?Why did you allow yourself to get hurt for me?

431
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:44,200
Why did you allow yourself to get hurt for me?

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,208
Why did you allow yourself to get hurt for me?Have you gone insane?

433
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,135
Have you gone insane?

434
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,064
Just hold on, Pooh.

435
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:52,059
You can’t die because of me!

436
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,220
If you die, how can Piglet live?

437
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,223
If you die, how can Piglet live?Young Master, I haven’t died yet.

438
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:55,935
Young Master, I haven’t died yet.

439
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,544
It’s just a slight cut.

440
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,539
I’m still alive.

441
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,607
Go rescue Mone.

442
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,096
I’ll take care of Pooh here.

443
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,951
Teacher Toomtam?!

444
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,423
Stop right there.

445
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,000
One step closer means she will be injected to death.

446
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:42,592
Please rescue her.

447
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,288
You!

448
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:46,943
Why are you impeding my happiness?!

449
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,327
Why did you invade my mom’s house?

450
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,008
Why did you come in here?

451
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:55,440
Krating, you’re a boxer, right?

452
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:56,352
I am.

453
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:57,536
Is this the right time to ask?

454
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:59,529
I’m also a Petong athlete.

455
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,809
I’ll count from one to ten.

456
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:00,816
I’ll count from one to ten.Is that too long?

457
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,000
Is that too long?

458
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,816
Let’s go with ten.

459
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,064
What the hell are you saying?

460
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:06,559
If you step closer,	I’ll kill her for sure.

461
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:07,392
One.

462
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:09,104
Two.

463
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:10,703
Ten.

464
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:19,807
Mone.

465
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:21,392
Mone?

466
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:24,960
Why did you do this?

467
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:26,367
Why did you kill kids?

468
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,384
You’re a psycho.

469
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,619
Because of you and your mom,

470
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:36,624
Because of you and your mom,kids can’t be happy.

471
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:37,839
kids can’t be happy.

472
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:39,839
Those kids had to die!

473
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:44,496
I understand now why you were kidnapped.

474
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,895
I know now what the kidnapper wanted.

475
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:51,551
The kidnapper wanted you to be happy and eat tasty desserts.

476
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,150
Why couldn’t you do that?

477
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,135
How can a person like you understand?

478
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:56,096
You devil!

479
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:58,440
Mone, are you alright?

480
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,448
Mone, are you alright?You evil!

481
00:25:58,448 --> 00:25:59,023
You evil!

482
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,384
Krating, stop Punn now.

483
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:05,920
Uncle, enough.

484
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,632
Enough already.

485
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,839
He deserves more.

486
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,784
Teacher Toomtam was kidnapped when he was young.

487
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:19,167
He was a homeless child whom nobody paid attention to.

488
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,624
He has this mental illness because the kidnapper taught him to do it.

489
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,352
He is just a patient, Punn.

490
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,167
Mom!

491
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:40,736
Mommy!

492
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,511
Mom!

493
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,167
Where are you, mom?

494
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,779
Pooh Bear, you can’t die.

495
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:56,784
Pooh Bear, you can’t die.I don’t want to be fatherless. Pooh Bear.

496
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,599
I don’t want to be fatherless. Pooh Bear.

497
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:58,607
I don’t want to be fatherless. Pooh Bear.Don’t leave us.
Pooh Bear!

498
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,943
Don’t leave us.
Pooh Bear!

499
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,380
I’m still alive.

500
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:04,432
It was just a slight cut.

501
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,455
I just felt like fainting when seeing bloods.

502
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,776
Who dared do this to my dad?!

503
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,500
At first, it’s just a slight cut,

504
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,503
At first, it’s just a slight cut,but now it has become lacerated.

505
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,056
but now it has become lacerated.

506
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,711
Let’s go now.

507
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:18,991
Mone!

508
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:20,751
Are you alright?

509
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:21,824
You’re safe, right?

510
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,231
You’re safe, right?

511
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,407
Do you feel hurt?

512
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:30,511
I’m alright.

513
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,551
I’m safe.

514
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:33,400
Look at your face.

515
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,407
Look at your face.Safe, huh?

516
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:34,640
Safe, huh?

517
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,000
Goodness.

518
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,519
We’ve successfully saved the kids.

519
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,839
Mone.

520
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,991
My best girl.

521
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:46,990
I’m alright, mom.

522
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:48,480
It just feels like an ant bite.

523
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,872
I’ll handle it if it bites you.

524
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:52,991
I’m cool, right?

525
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,720
Super cool.

526
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,567
Finally, we have reached a nice ending.

527
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,672
Luckily, nobody got hurt much.

528
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,200
From now, no more kids will be kidnapped.

529
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,496
No more kids will become the victims of adults.

530
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:33,087
You kidnapped my son, right?

531
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,887
Have you ever seen this boy?

532
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,311
Nuan,

533
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:57,407
I’m sorry.

534
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,215
I can’t find our son.

535
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,632
Tert,

536
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,703
it’s alright.

537
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,839
Let’s go home

538
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:13,663
Let’s go back home.

539
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,016
It’s alright.

540
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:26,847
It’s alright, Tert.

541
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:50,912
Nuan.

542
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:11,471
Where do you think our son is now?

543
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:21,887
We should let him go already.

544
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,680
We have been keeping him with us for too long.

545
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:41,023
Let him go.

546
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:48,415
Just keep him in the memory in our heart.

547
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:54,256
If he’s still alive,

548
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,567
he surely doesn’t want to see us in sorrow like this.

549
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:08,048
Let’s start again, Tert.

550
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,496
There’s still a chance for us to be happy.

551
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,791
I’m bringing you the cake.

552
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:37,455
It’s made with a special recipe that I’ve ordered for you two.

553
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,400
Please take it.

554
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:51,400
I’m sorry.

555
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,400
I’m sorry for doing that to you.

556
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
I have always felt guilty,

557
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:05,248
but I don’t know how to compensate.

558
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:12,672
Please eat this cake

559
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,536
and be happy.

560
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:34,384
I hope this cake can heal you and make you happy.

561
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:14,688
Thank you.

562
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,199
Thanks everyone here for rescuing Mone.

563
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,992
Our Phueak Nae page family feels truly touched.

564
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:41,056
No worries.

565
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
We’re happy to help.

566
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:44,735
That’s right.

567
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:46,831
There’s no need to thank.

568
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,248
I don’t know how to return you the favor.

569
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,936
Please come and have desserts here often.

570
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,231
You’re so good at selling.

571
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,016
We hope that what we did can return you the favor.

572
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,327
What is it?

573
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,512
Guys, look here.

574
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:13,744
Phueak Nae page posted about Sweet Day Café again.

575
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,800
This time I guarantee

576
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,800
that it will attract more people’s attention than previous article did.

577
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:24,384
Now, there’s nobody in this country who doesn’t know Sweet Day Café.

578
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,943
Thank you, Mone.

579
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:28,447
Thank you to your whole family.

580
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,527
Tons of girls will come here for sure.

581
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,320
Does this mean there will be people coming to take photos with me and check-in on their social media here?

582
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:39,264
Congratulations, Young Master.

583
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,335
Nana?

584
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:49,184
Punn, can I take a photo with you and check-in on my social media?

585
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:52,559
Sure.

586
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,367
Come here.

587
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:55,664
You can take hundreds of photos with me.

588
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,367
Nobody is going to take a photo for them?

589
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,440
Let me take it for you.

590
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,039
Please.

591
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,175
Sure.

592
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,648
You’re the first person who took a photo with me.

593
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:15,536
From now, you can have our desserts for free all your life.

594
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:20,927
Can I also take a photo with you?

595
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,400
I want free desserts.

596
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,311
My pleasure.

597
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:32,880
Hey, take a look.

598
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,735
Does it look fine?

599
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,429
[We’re hiring.]
[-Waiter]
[-Pastry Chef Assistant]

600
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:41,264
It’s good to write in the brackets that we’re accepting male crews only.

601
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,632
Stop that, Weir.

602
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,630
You can work with women now.

603
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:54,079
But it feels kind of sad to leave this café.

604
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:58,527
True.

605
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,967
I’m truly bonded with this place.

606
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,335
Why are you guys sad?

607
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:10,672
One is going to study abroad.

608
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:12,608
The other is having a family.

609
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:15,568
It’s not a forever goodbye for us.

610
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,527
We’re going to meet again.

611
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,440
Though we’re parting now,

612
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,447
Though we’re parting now,I’m still glad that we all have our own paths.

613
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,840
I’m still glad that we all have our own paths.

614
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,360
I’m late.	I’m late already.

615

616
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,960

617
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:35,967
Baby Pig!	Don’t go down the stairs yet!	You might fall down.I’m already late.
Wait.

618
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,112
I’m already late.
Wait.

619
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,559
Put your hair clip on first.
I’m late already.

620
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,429
Keep your voice down, both of you.

621
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:42,431
Keep your voice down, both of you.I’m working.

622
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:43,840
I’m working.

623
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,447
I’m leaving for school, mom.

624
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:53,088
I’ll send her off to school.

625
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:54,063
I’ll be back soon.

626
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:55,480
Hurry up.

627
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:55,487
Hurry up.Let’s go.

628
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,088
Let’s go.

629
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:00,943
When you arrive,

630
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:02,559
hand this to them.

631
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,719
Don’t forget your VISA.Understand?

632
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
Merci.

633
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:09,088
Pas de problème.

634
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,592
Thank you for everything, Mone.

635
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,519
Good luck.

636
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:30,896
Mone.

637
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,007
What happened during grade 4?

638
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,583
Im Aim said that your first love totally failed then.

639
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,543
If you don’t want to fail again,

640
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,416
I can tell you a solution.

641
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,215
Do you want to know?

642
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,088
I don’t.

643
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:52,271
I want to stay single.

644
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,128
Stay single then.

645
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:58,800
Be single until I come back.

646
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:07,728
Hey?

647
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:08,896
Are you smile?

648
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:10,672
Why can’t I?

649
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,744
I thought you’re not up yet,

650
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:30,719
so I came to wake you up.

651
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:36,416
Do you still have a nightmare?

652
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:39,103
Off and on.

653
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,456
But I’m alright.

654
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,967
Hurry up then.

655
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,320
I’ve prepared your favorite dish.

656
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,632
All this time,

657
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,831
many things have changed.

658
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,280
Some have their own paths to walk on.

659
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,751
You hold my hand for too long.

660
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,943
They left the café to move forward.

661
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,192
Some are still here,

662
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,311
enjoying what they do.

663
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,936
I still hope that one day I will have a chance to meet my first love.

664
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:50,880
There will be one day that the girl in that pink dress walks into the café

665
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,192
and tells me her name.

666
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:01,440
Though I haven’t found her yet,

667
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,208
it’s still alright

668
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:11,887
Taste it, Boss.

669
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,000
No.

670
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:17,791
Nope.

671
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:25,789
You Weir!

672
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,215
The bitterness in my life has gone.

673
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,800
From now, I will only be happy,

674
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,784
but it’s fine if it turns a bit bitter in the future

675
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:44,079
because sweetness heals everything.

676
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,711
Boss,

677
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,679
why don’t we just use a sign that we can hang?

678
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:21,983
so we don’t need to unfold it everyday.

679
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:24,592
It’s my style.

680
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,960
Have you ever asked yourself,

681
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:35,967
Have you ever asked yourself,when is the most important moment of your life?

682
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:39,472
when is the most important moment of your life?

683
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,440
Alright, everyone. Smile.

684
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,280
One, two, three.

685
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,007
We’re back into our younger bodies.

686
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,079
Is that so?

687
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,775
LET THE PAST BECOME THE FUTURE.

688
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,192
START AGAIN FOR ONE LAST TIME.

689
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,480

692
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,840
She is the one I’ve been waiting for all my life.

FOR DREAMS

694
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:14,559
I will stand on stage again.

695

FOR MEMORIES.

696
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:20,976
