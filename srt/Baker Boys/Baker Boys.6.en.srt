00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,359
Hey, why are you here?

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,359
Why did you come outside late at night?

13
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,740
Hey, what’s wrong?

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,020
What happened?

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,859
Did someone hurt you?

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:56,820
Dessert.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,979
Dessert.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,820
Help me.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,179
That person gave me a dessert to eat.

20
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,900
Who gave it to you?

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,879
What dessert?

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Lieutenant, why did the girl walk around here alone?

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,519
The reason is still unknown.

31
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,819
When I ran into her,

32
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,159
her condition was not quite good.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,139
How is she now?

34
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,319
She’s safe.

35
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,419
She’s under the care of the doctor now.

36
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,939
There’s nothing to worry about.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,379
Did she see the face of the kidnapper?

38
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,379
Come on.

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,379
Please tell us a bit.

40
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,060
Alright.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,819
I’ll answer your question.

42
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,719
When it happened,

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,439
the kid was drugged,

44
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,599
so she didn’t have much consciousness.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,219
Let alone recognized the kidnapper’s face,

46
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,439
the girl couldn’t even remember how she escaped.

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,099
Alright. Please leave now.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,979
Your whole family, please leave already.

49
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,560
I will continue to inspect the scene.

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,180
We’ve just arrived.

51
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,020
Please.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,199
Leaving or not?

53
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,039
Not leaving, right?

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Fine.

55
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,520
I’m leaving first.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,139
See you later.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,180
Goodbye.

58
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,939
We even came here.

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,939
Did we get any information, huh?

60
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,939
Here you are.

61
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,139
This is your order and your change.

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,599
But I guess it’s better if the change is converted into love.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,879
If you take a photo with me and check-in at our café on social media,

64
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,099
you’ll get a special discount.

65

69
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,100
Wow.

70
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,439
This is so yummy.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,600
It is, right?

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,519
It’s freshly baked.

73
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,519
You’re the first person to try it.PL

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,600
Really?

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Can I have one more?

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,139
Sure.

77
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,259
Why didn’t you tell me that you’re working at a dessert café?

78
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,439
You know I like desserts, don’t you?

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,220
I’m sorry.

80
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,879
I didn’t mean to do it.

81
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,180
Chef,

82
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,180
Since when did that uncle bodyguard have a girlfriend?

83
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,740
I don’t know either.

84
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,660
But she is still too young.

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,040
Isn’t it illegal?

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,319
So, Pooh actually likes high school girls, doesn’t he?

87
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,160
Pooh, can you please send me off to school?

88
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,620
I told my teacher that

89
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
I had to do an errand with my family in the morning.

90
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,459
I came here just to see you.

91
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,180
Baby Pig,

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,779
I told you already that lying is bad.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,579
Don’t do this again.

94
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,019
Alright.

95
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:36,980
I won’t do it again.

96
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,839
Young master, can I send Baby Pig off to school?

97
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,240
I will hurry back here.

98
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,259
Sure.

99
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,579
Let’s go now.

100
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,939
Please carry the bag for me.

101
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,560
Boss,

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,699
since when did Pooh have a girlfriend?

103
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:00,860
Why didn’t I know about it?

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
Why didn’t I know about it?

105
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,680
He’s dating a girl.

106
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,939
Wicked.

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,879
Piglet is not in high school.

108
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,879
She’s only in grade 8.

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,279
What?

110
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,100
Grade 8?

111
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,300
Well,

112
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,459
we ran out of cookies.

113
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,459
What a teen.

114
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,959
Pooh.

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,160
Boss told us that you love that student so much. Right?

116
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,279
Yes.

117
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,480
I do love my Baby Pig so much.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,420
But that’s not appropriate, is it?

119
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,800
She’s only in grade 8.

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,819
Why?

121
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,819
Why can’t I love a grade 8 student?

122
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:10,980
You will be sent to jail.

123
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,500
But Baby Pig…

124
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,339
I mean Piglet is my daughter.

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,759
What?

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,980
Your daughter?

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,079
I’m her dad.

128
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,240
You mean a daughter by blood?

129
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,379
Yes.

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,500
That’s right.

131
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,100
She’s his daughter for real.

132
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
He gave birth to her.

133
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,139
What’s going on here?

134
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,800
I’m totally confused now.

135
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:37,279
Does this mean you’re already married?

136
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,439
No, I’m not.

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,860
I’m not married.

138
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,339
So your girlfriend got pregnant before marriage?

139
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,180
Pooh donated his sperm to Piglet’s mother.

140
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,779
Her name is Tiwa.

141
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,639
Why did you end up donating your sperm to her?

142
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,019
Well…

143
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,459
Are you alright?

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,960
I am.

145
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,179
But can you help me with one thing?

146
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,360
What is it?

147
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,159
Please have a baby with me.

148
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,539
Huh?

149
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,519
Please.

150
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,360
I’m begging you.

151
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,360
I really want to become a mother.

152
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,620
If that’s what you want…

153
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:57,860
Alright.

154
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
Well, Tiwa has been haunted by her past memory.

155
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,559
Her dad abused her.

156
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,240
She doesn’t want a husband,

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,120
and she doesn’t want to spend her life with any man either.

158
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,899
But she still wanted to have a baby.

159
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,039
I understood her suffering,

160
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,820
so I agreed to help.

161
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,559
You’re such a good man.

162
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,179
You’d better stop being silly.

163
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,779
I agreed with Uncle Bodyguard.

164
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,679
So, your daughter was born by an artificial insemination?

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,899
No.

166
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,480
It was a natural process.

167
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,580
How can a person like him know how to ‘do’ it?

168
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,399
Yes.

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,139
You mean natural for real?

170
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:45,840
Yes.

171
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,539
Only once.

172
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,399
Mom, on your upcoming birthday,

173
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,220
let’s go celebrate at a cake café, shall we?

174
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,580
Alright.

175
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,740
Is there any gift that you want?

176
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,440
Anything will do.

177
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,320
But I…

178
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,019
Piglet.

179
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,460
Don’t you see that I’m working?

180
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,460
Can we talk later?

181
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:32,759
Alright.

182
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:42,919
Mom,

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,240
I want to ask for your permission.

184
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,299
What’s that?

185
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:56,379
Who’s that?

186
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,240
Who?

187
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,879
Baby Pig?!

188
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,000
From today, I’ll stay here with you.

189
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,320
Piglet, what are you thinking?

190
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,639
Well, I just came here to stay with Pooh and Uncle Punn,

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,379
but I didn’t expect that there would be lots of people like this.

192
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,480
This is so warm.

193
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,639
Won’t your mom scold you for this?

194
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,799
I told my mom

195
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,059
that I would be going on a school’s field trip for 3 days and 2 nights.

196
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,320
My mom helped me pack herself.

197
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,899
Baby Pig, I told you that lying is bad, didn’t I?

198
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,360
But mom already allowed me to come,

199
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,220
though it’s a different story.

200
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,100
Tiwa must be super angry, Young Master.

201
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,700
True.

202
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,059
We will all be in trouble for sure.

203
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,980
So you two mustn’t let mom find out.

204
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,279
Or else, she will hit me for sure.

205
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,799
Won’t you feel sorry for me?

206
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,600
It’s just for three days.

207
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,600
I promise I will behave.

208
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,639
I won’t be naughty at all.

209
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,620
Please.

210
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,059
Please.

211
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,500
Actually, I came here because I want to bake a birthday cake for my mom.

212
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,740
I want her to be happy.

213
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,100
But Pooh and Uncle Poon don’t agree to help,

214
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,240
I will learn it from somewhere else instead.

215
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,919
But now I can’t go back home anyway.

216
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,320
If I do, mom will find out that I lied to her.

217
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,960
I guess I must sleep under a pedestrian bridge.

218
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,139
Under the pedestrian bride?

219
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,879
You feel sorry for me, right?

220
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,019
Nope.

221
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,240
It’s obvious you said this to make us feel sorry for you.

222
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,299
You’re completely different from your dad.

223
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,580
How?

224
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,399
I resemble him.

225
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,539
You guys are similar in height.

226
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,279
But I guess your intelligence level resembles that of your mom.

227
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,460
So… I can stay here, right?

228
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,919
No!

229
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,840
Please let me stay here.

230
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,240
I really want to bake a birthday cake for my mom.

231
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,720
Mom is always busy with her work.

232
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,360
She doesn’t pay attention to me at all.

233
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,960
I just want to grab her attention.

234
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,759
Do you want to bake a cake for your mom that much?

235
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:19,960
Yes.

236
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,200
Sweet Day’s cakes are the most delicious ones I’ve ever had.

237
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,919
If I can bake such a delicious cake,

238
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,639
mom will be so surprised.

239
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
Mom rarely gets to eat good food.

240
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,620
Please help me.

241
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,779
I’m begging you.

242
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,139
It’s just for three days.

243
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,440
It seems she came with a good intention.

244
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
Fine.

245
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,039
Well then, let’s start learning, shall we?

246
00:13:59,059 --> 00:13:59,480
Good.

247
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,759
I’ll join.

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,639
I’ll also help with the cake turntable.

249
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,440
Uncle Poon?

250
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Let’s go.

251
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,059
I don’t understand why the kidnapper changed the target.

252
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,980
According to previous cases, the kidnapper usually chose marginal kids

253
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,659
who rarely receives attention from others.

254
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,419
But this time, the kidnapper decided to kidnap the kid that has a family.

255
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,019
What is the reason?

256
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Is that because the wanted to change the kidnap pattern.

257
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,980
in order to confuse to police team?

258
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,919
Probably, there’s more than one kidnapper.

259
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,299
Plus, the kidnapper chose to kidnap Lert Anan School’s student.

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,580
This change in pattern is suspicious.

261
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:59,179
Though I still can’t figure out why the kidnapper did so,

262
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:05,779
I’m certain that the murder must be living near the exercise ground.

263
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,039
That’s because it’s impossible for a little kid who was drugged

264
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,220
to walk by foot for more than 3 kilometers.

265
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,059
That includes the Sweet Day Café.

266
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,639
Is it possible that it’s the same kidnapper from the previous case?

267
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,700
That café’s dessert bag was found at the scene.

268
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,519
That café is not very far from the scene.

269
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,679
[Sweet Day Café’]

270
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,059
You let them do it on their own like this.

271
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,039
Do you think they will make it, Chef?

272
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,899
That uncle seems lame,

273
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,320
and Piglet is…

274
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,179
I think you put too much force.

275
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,899
But that dad and his daughter want to succeed by themselves.

276
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,500
But now I guess they will ruin it themselves.

277
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,100
They’ve unsuccessfully cracked so many eggs already.

278
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,360
But it seems they really put a lot effort in it.

279
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,120
Look at them.

280
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,360
Looking at how they’re doing now,

281
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:19,539
I guess it will take two days.

282
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
To be able to bake a cake?

283
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,259
To destroy our café.

284
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,259
Whose turn is it today to clean the kitchen?

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,559
It’s your turn, Chef.

286
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,120
Mesa, younger sister of Meena, a student in my class?

287
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,440
Yes. She was kidnapped.

288
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,779
I think the kidnapper is that desserts murderer.

289
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,960
because Mesa mentioned that she was forced to eat a dessert.

290
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,259
But nobody in this school knows about this.

291
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,799
I guess they want to conceal it

292
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,339
because if it becomes the news,

293
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,240
school’s reputation will be totally ruined.

294
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,880
Is this a school or what?

295
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
School officials are more concerned about reputation than students’ safety.

296
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,359
I guess I must do something.

297
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,359
Hey, I need your help.

298
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:27,480
What is it?

299
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,180
Please arrange Mesa and her family to meet me.

300
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,700
If I get to talk to them,

301
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,640
I may get new information

302
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,299
apart from what the police have been gathering so far.

303
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,339
Well, I’m not sure whether they will agree to talk.

304
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,480
But I’ll try.

305
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,819
Thanks a lot.

306
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,460
If we let it continues,

307
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:58,880
more students could be kidnapped.

308
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:12,880
How is it?

309
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,579
It’s super delicious.

310
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,740
Are you interested in opening a restaurant at my school?

311
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,180
So, I can eat the dish you cook every day.

312
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,619
I’m glad you like it,

313
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,519
but I need to work for this café.

314
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,700
Or else, you won’t get to eat delicious desserts.

315
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,119
What a regret.

316
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,640
Meena and I always discuss that school’s food is not delicious at all.

317
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,579
I’ll complain about it at school,

318
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,779
accusing them for cooking such tasteless food for Baby Pig.

319
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,779
Uncle, chill out.

320
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,160
Don’t exaggerate.

321
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,579
Baby Pig, apart from food,

322
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,579
do you face any other problems?

323
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,559
When I’m with Meena,

324
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,180
others like to believe that I’m her older sister.

325
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,700
They think that I’m already in grade 12,

326
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:09,779
while I’m actually half a year younger than Meena.

327
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,539
It’s just that I’m a bit taller than her.

328
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,180
I think it’s not just a bit.

329
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
Uncle Punn!

330
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,779
My friends also told me that I’m weird once.

331
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,299
How?

332
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,559
Well, I have been growing up differently.

333
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,460
I’m not living with my dad.

334
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,839
Mom rarely drops me off at school and picks me up

335
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,000
like other parents do.

336
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,740
But I think Tiwa loves you a lot.

337
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,039
I know that she loves me.

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,039
She’s just trying to teach me how to be independent.

339
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,079
But recently,

340
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,079
mom has been so busy with her work.

341
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,319
She doesn’t play with me.

342
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,819
She doesn’t pay attention to me at all.

343
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,880
I start to think that

344
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,759
she probably doesn’t love anymore.

345
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,079
She doesn’t want to play with me.

346
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,200
Nobody wants to play with me.

347
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,460
People think I’m no longer a kid,

348
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
but I actually am!

349
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,460
Don’t cry.

350
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,380
Eat this.

351
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,160
No!

352
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,940
Piglet, look here.

353
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,480
Piglet, don’t cry.

354
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,299
For your three days living with us here,

355
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,819
be happiest.

356
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,039
Alright?

357
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,779
Get under the blanket.

358
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,819
Is the temperature too cold?

359
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,180
Nope. It’s just right.

360
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,400
Alright. Sleep now.

361
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,400
If you need anything, let me know.

362
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,400
Sweet dreams.

363
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,039
Can you sleep in this room with me tonight?

364
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,039
Sure.

365
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,440
If I can have you sleep here every night,

366
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,119
it will be so good.

367
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,700
Wow.

368
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,839
Are these the same cookies I had the other day?

369
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:15,900
Yes.

370
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,460
These are French butter cookies called Sablé Breton.

371
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,920
But in this recipe, I will add dried longan

372
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,460
to add some Thai flavor to the cookies.

373
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,460
So I name this, Golden Longan Sablé Breton.

374
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:40,619
That’s all?

375
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,700
That would be all for its general recipe.

376
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
But for our café, we have a secret recipe.

377
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,539
What is it?

378
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,660
Just use this a little. Our cookies will be delicious, mellow,

379
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,319
with a nice touch of milky aroma.

380
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,920
Have a bite.

381
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,059
Wow, it’s really good.

382
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,099
When I get to taste a delicious thing like this,

383
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,299
I would like to become a great baker like you soon.

384
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,920
I want my mother to see what I can do.

385
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,019
Go ahead. Call Pooh to learn too.

386
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,720
Pooh Bear, come learn baking together.

387
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,680
Actually, Uncle Pooh looks like a good father.

388
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,680
I know,

389
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:30,960
right? He looks so warm.

390
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,839
Pooh looks happy when he is with his daughter.

391
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,700
Young Master,

392
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
may I ask you to look after my Baby Pig for a second.

393
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,000
I need to take a shower.

394
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,460
Why do you need to ask?

395
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,460
She’s not going anywhere.

396
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,359
I won’t run away.

397
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,839
I will come back and play with you right away.

398
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:10,839
Wait.

399
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,400
Can I have your phone? I would like to play a game.

400
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,460
Sure.

401
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,700
Thank you.

402
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,259
I’ll be right back.

403
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,779
Uncle Punn.

404
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,140
How to make two people fall for each other?

405
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,339
Why are you asking me?

406
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,500
Are you into someone?

407
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,980
No. No.

408
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,440
I want my father and my mother to love each other like other parents.

409
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,980
But I think…

410
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,039
Here, Uncle Punn.

411
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,140
Can you pretend to be Pooh Bear and send a sweet chat to my mother?

412
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,460
He told me you are flirty.

413
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:59,039
I’m sure you are a pro at this.

414
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,940
Well, Piglet.

415
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,079
I think love is a matter between two people.

416
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:09,680
Uncle Punn.

417
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,900
Didn’t you tell me you would do what I wanted during these 3 days?

418
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,019
Are you a liar?

419
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,980
I am not.

420
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Then, text my mother.

421
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,240
Should I?

422
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,380
Go ahead. This must be pretty easy for you.

423
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,019
(I may have nothing to enchant you,

424
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,740
but I’ll do what it takes to make you fall for me.)

425
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,160
(No matter how vast the sky is, my small heart belongs to you.)

426
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,339
(My face may look cool, but my heart for you is warm.)

427
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,339
(From Pooh Bear)

428
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,859
What has gotten into him?

429
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,400
Pooh Bear?

430
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,240
Is it him?

431
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,839
Ma’am. They are from the Phuak Nae news page.

432
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,259
Nice to meet you.

433
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:16,799
Hi, ma’am.

434
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,759
Thank you so much for allowing us to see you today.

435
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,680
Ms. Im-aim told me about your searching for the kidnapper who abducted my daughter.

436
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,700
We would like to ask both Mesa and you.

437
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,059
We may get some info that leads to the kidnapper.

438
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,839
Would you mind if we ask you?

439
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,079
May I?

440
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,720
Do you remember the day that Mesa disappeared?

441
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,579
What happened that day?

442
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,099
Normally, Mesa waits with her older sister to go home together.

443
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,720
But that day, Mesa disappeared.

444
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,240
She was not at the pick-up point like usual.

445
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,440
Before we realized that Mesa was gone,

446
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,119
several hours had passed.

447
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,079
Where is your usual pick-up point?

448
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,500
It depends.

449
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,339
Mostly, it’s around this waiting area here.

450
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,640
Mesa.

451
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,000
May I ask you something?

452
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,740
You don’t need to speak to answer me.

453
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,079
Just nodding or shaking your head will do.

454
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,119
Okay?

455
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,700
Do you remember what happened that day?

456
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,700
Where did the kidnapper take you to?

457
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,779
Did you see the kidnapper before?

458
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,700
Did he give you some sweets?

459
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,119
Mesa.

460
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,160
Do you happen to remember the face of the kidnapper?

461
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,079
His hair is grey.

462
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,079
What do you mean?

463
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,259
He’s an old man.

464
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,299
An old man?

465
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,079
I’ll cook your favorite food.

466
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,299
Then we’ll have cake together.

467
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:21,960
Tert.

468
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,740
I think you should stop.

469
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,099
Don’t do this.

470
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,380
Leave me alone.

471
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,500
Our son must be happiest.

472
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:05,880
It’ll be done soon.

473
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,119
My cake is done.

474
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,380
Give her a big hand.

475
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,140
I’ll put it in a box for you.

476
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,279
It’ll be in good condition when you show this to your mother.

477
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,359
Thank you, Weir.

478
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,380
Let me help, Chef.

479
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,440
Thank you, my handsome Krating.

480
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,299
Piglet, how about we take a photo together?

481
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,599
No, thank you, Uncle Punn.

482
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,460
Why am I the only person who is an uncle here?

483
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,339
Pooh Bear said I must pay respect to his Young Master.

484
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,859
At first, I would like to call you lord.

485
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,359
But Pooh Bear said it was a bit too much.

486
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
So I call you Uncle Punn.

487
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,900
Pooh Bear, let’s celebrate mom’s birthday together this year.

488
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,420
So we are all together, you, mom, and me.

489
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,579
Uh…

490
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,440
Please join us. So we are together as a whole family.

491
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,900
Please.

492
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,440
Don’t you want to be with mom and me?

493
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,039
No. It’s not that. I just…

494
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,759
Piglet.

495
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,299
Mom.

496
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,180
Please calm down first, Tiwa.

497
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,119
How can I keep calm?

498
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,259
My daughter lied to me that she was on a school field trip.

499
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,140
Instead, she is living in a house full of men?

500
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:47,599
I find those messages suspicious, that’s how I know.

501
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,740
What messages?

502
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,359
The tacky messages you sent to flirt with me.

503
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,619
But I never do anything to flirt with you.

504
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,200
I know it’s not you.

505
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,599
But it’s this man and Piglet.

506
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I know that it’s you.

507
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:05,880
because Pooh has never called himself “Pooh Bear” with me.

508
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,420
I’m sorry.

509
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,420
It’s all my fault.

510
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,460
Tiwa, listen. Baby Pig is...

511
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Don’t try to defend her.

512
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,460
What kind of a grown man are you?

513
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:21,259
How could you let her lie to me?

514
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,819
Is this the right thing to do?

515
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:28,140
You cannot be a good father if you support your daughter on something like this.

516
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:32,599
Piglet, go home.

517
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,119
No. I’m not going.

518
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,799
You never care about me when I’m with you there.

519
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,440
Piglet.

520
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,839
I just made a cake for you as a birthday present.

521
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,700
I want you to be proud and look at me.

522
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,319
Is it so wrong if I want to have a father.

523
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,920
and a mother just like everybody else.

524
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,259
Baby Pig.

525
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,679
Baby Pig.

526
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,980
Do you know,

527
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,780
during these past 3 days,

528
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,420
I feel so happy that I get to be with you.

529
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,400
Honestly, I wish I could be with you every day.

530
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,940
I would like to drive you to school.

531
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,219
I would like to cook for you.

532
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,739
I would like to tuck you in every night.

533
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,340
I would like to be a good father to you.

534
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,340
But…

535
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,380
I’m not ready right now.

536
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,400
Why, Pooh Bear?

537
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,219
I don’t know if I could really be a good father to you,

538
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:27,500
or if I could be good enough to be in your life,

539
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,099
and Tiwa’s life.

540
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,159
Please understand me, Baby Pig.

541
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,579
But I want us to be together.

542
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,079
I want a complete family

543
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,619
with a father, a mother,

544
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,760
and me.

545
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,199
Can’t you do this for me?

546
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,300
Baby Pig.

547
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:11,519
A complete family doesn’t always consist of a father, a mother, and a child.

548
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,159
Some families do not have everyone living together.

549
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,579
But they can still be complete families.

550
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,239
Do you know why?

551
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,860
Why?

552
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,579
Because of love.

553
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,840
The love everyone has for other members of the family.

554
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,199
I don’t understand.

555
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,920
Do you think I love you?

556
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,719
Do you think that your mother loves you?

557
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,460
Do you love me and Tiwa?

558
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,460
I do.

559
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,239
Very much.

560
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,519
Then you already have a complete family.

561
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,219
Though we cannot be together,

562
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,039
we can always have love for each other.

563
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,860
The meaning of family,

564
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,659
doesn’t mean the number of members in the family.

565
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,980
It’s the feeling and bond we have.

566
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,599
In the old days,

567
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,940
I lived with my father and mother.

568
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,099
But you know what?

569
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,920
I didn’t feel like I belonged in the family.

570
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,119
My father liked to hit me and my mother.

571
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:13,980
I understand now.

572
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,099
You are the best father I could ever have.

573
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,820
I love you, Baby Pig.

574
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,719
Stop crying.

575
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,420
You stop crying too.

576
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,480
Ms. Tiwa.

577
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,659
Yes?

578
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,679
This is the cake that Baby Pig and I made together.

579
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,300
(Love Mommy Tiwa, from Piglet and Pooh Bear)

580
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,139
Thanks.

581
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:22,039
I’m sorry that I let Baby Pig lie to you.

582
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,940
I’m truly sorry.

583
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,519
Enough. Stop bowing to me.

584
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,340
I’m sorry for bowing too long.

585
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,280
You’re still the same.

586
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,719
I’m sorry for being the same.

587
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,280
I’ve been really busy lately.

588
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:50,320
If Piglet wants to stay over at your place later on,

589
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,280
you must tell me in advance. Understood?

590
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,159
Can I, Mom?

591
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,639
But we must have a video call every time.

592
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,639
Thank you so much.

593
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,000
I will take good care of her.

594
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,579
And I will make a video call to you every time.

595
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,579
I mean Piglet, not you.

596
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,000
I don’t need you to do that.

597
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:14,519
I’m sorry.

598
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,280
Enough. Let’s go, dear.

599
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,219
Ms. Tiwa.

600
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,219
Happy birthday in advance.

601
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,059
Bye-bye.

602
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,260
Keep going, bro.

603
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,260
I will.

604
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,599
You must become the best dad of the year.

605
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,559
I will try. Thank you.

606
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,079
If you feel like crying, you can lean on my chest.

607
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,480
No, thanks.

608
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,980
I don’t feel like crying at all.

609
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,000
Don’t be in denial.

610
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:16,239
It’s obvious that you are being emotional right now.

611
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:18,599
I’m not.

612
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,960
Young Master is tight-lipped.

613
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,659
Found it!

614
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:08,079
(10-years-old boy murdered ruthlessly and left sideway. Murderer at large.)

615
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,920
Do you think that this case might be related to the recent murders?

616
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:19,000
21 years ago, your dad and I followed this case.

617
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Kids got kidnapped and murdered.

618
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,679
The murderer left desserts near the bodies.

619
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,400
The murderer is still at large until now.

620
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:35,139
Maybe, it’s this same murderer who is responsible for the recent crimes.

621
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,519
And a year after that,

622
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,960
a boy got kidnapped.

623
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,360
But he survived.

624
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,159
Honey.

625
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,960
If we can find this boy,

626
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,820
we may get some leads.

627
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,840
The surviving kid is named Punnapat Dechrachatanan.

628
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,420
Why do I find this name familiar?

629
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:06,079
Could it be…

630
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:08,739
The owner of Sweet Day café!

631
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,059
Hello.

632
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,059
Welcome to our café.

633
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:37,780
Bonjour.

634
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,300
Bonjour.

635
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,059
Kid,

636
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,360
is Chef Weir here?

637
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,619
Weir?

638
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,699
Mon amour.

639
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,340
It’s been a while, honey.

640
00:43:58,579 --> 00:43:59,460
I’ve been missing you.

641
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,400
What is all this?

642
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Weir, who is this man?

643
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,400
I’m the owner of this café.

644
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,900
Who are you?

645
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,000
Me?

646
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,000
I’m the owner of Weir.

647
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:27,420
You? Weir’s boss?

648
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:28,559
So?

649
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,139
What does it have anything to do with you?

650
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:32,139
Everything about Weir is my matter.

651
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,000
I don’t want Weir to waste his time in a café that…

652
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,000
doesn’t deserve Weir.

653
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:42,219
Hey, Mister.

654
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,219
What do you mean?

655
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:47,659
Jean, please go.

656
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,659
This is not a good time. I need to work.

657
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:53,260
Please go.

658
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,440
Fine. See you later, honey.

659
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,079
I miss you.

660
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,340
Bye.

661
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,539
I don’t like him.

662
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,659
Me too.

663
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,400
Who is he, Weir?

664
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,719
Jean is my pastry mentor.

665
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,000
He owns l'oeuf ou la poule that I worked for in France.

666
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,639
And…

667
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,739
he’s also my ex.

668
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:31,159
What?

669
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,780
Your ex?
