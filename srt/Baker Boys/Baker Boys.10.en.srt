00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,010
Hello!

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,430
Jean?!

46
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,730
Why are you here?

47
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,310
I’m here as Weir’s boyfriend.

48
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:28,939
Boyfriend?

49
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:31,959
You two broke up already, didn’t you?

50
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,439
Don’t come here again.

51
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,129
We don’t welcome you here.

52
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,099
I didn’t break up with him,

53
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,120
which means we haven’t broken up yet.

54
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,750
You badass.

55
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,400
I should handle you.

56
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,359
I’m just bringing the cake that I’ve baked with my best effort

57
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,799
to my darling’s family.

58
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:00,030
Jean, we broke up already.

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,030
Darling.

60
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,120
We just have a bit of conflict.

61
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,829
We don’t call it breaking up.

62
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,199
You already have a wife and children.

63
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,319
You call it ‘a bit’, huh?

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,479
Get out of my café now.

65
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,659
Do you have any right to give me orders?

66
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,439
I’m the owner here,

67
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,289
and I don’t welcome you.

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,349
Get him out.

69
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,469
Weir.

70
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,860
I put my effort in baking this cake.

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,900
Let go of me!

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,780
Mom.

Little sis.
Get out already.

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,960
It’s so tasty.

75
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,479
I’ll leave the cake here.

76
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,120
Please keep me in mind.

00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,550
Mom!

View, don’t worry about your wedding cake.

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,080
I’ll do my best.

80
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,800
You must stand by my side in the wedding ceremony.

81
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,710
This bride wants you to walk her down the aisle.

82
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,090
I promise.

83
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,240
promise.

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,530
Can I tell you something?

85
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,009
Sure.

86
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,629
Leave those bad things in your life behind.

87
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,629
Don’t keep them with you.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,430
If he doesn’t love you and doesn’t care for you,

89
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,669
don’t let him have any impact in your life.

90
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,919
He doesn’t deserve the love from my son.

91
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,389
Don’t worry, auntie.

92
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,129
If he bothers Chef Weir again,

93
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,650
I’ll handle him.

94
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,639
I will never allow him to step into our café.

95
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,490
Thank you, everyone.

96
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,330
Weir, you’re lucky to have these good friends caring about you.

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,520
They’re not just friends.

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,699

Are you really going to get rid of me from your life?

Let’s start learning about each other again, love.

Let’s fix the problem.

I will bite an apple waiting for you.

Bite an apple while waiting?

What’s that?

118
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,389
Ew!

119
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,389
That gives me goosebumps!

120
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,389
Just block him.

121
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,379
Weir!

122
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,480
What?

123
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,189
Does this idiot think he’s starring in a romantic movie or what?

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,029
I’ll handle him!

125

Young master!

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,769
Boss, don’t.

127
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,610
I don’t want you guys to get physical.

128
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,720
Don’t go down, Boss.

129
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,800
I’ve now come up with a good idea.

130
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,480
Make him go wild seeing this photo.

131
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:31,790
If I can’t get Weir.

132
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,569
you guys won’t either!

133
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,709
Host a battle with Sweet Day Café again?

134
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,480
That’s right.

135
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,990
I want you to host a special show

136
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,319
for a dessert battle between my café and Sweet Day.

137
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,269
Why does it have to be that café, Mr. Jean?

138
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,560
I’ve heard that your show was heavily criticized

139
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,069
for giving Sweet Day Café just a second place.

140
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,680
If you want to get your reputation back

141
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:18,879
and show the audience that Sweet Day Café is actually not that good as others have expected,

142
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:20,879
host this battle.

143
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,939
I guarantee that café will totally go belly-up.

144
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,160
Bring more Thai Tea almond cookies here.

145
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,250
Yes, Chef.

146
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,420
Hello, there.

147
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,279
Jean,

148
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,689
you still dare to come here?

149
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,879
Today, I’m not here to see Weir.

150
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
I’m here to give your café an offer.

151
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I won’t take any offer from you.

152
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,269
Well, I want to challenge Sweet Day Café to battle with me

153
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,129
in The Sweetest Shop show’s special episode.

154
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,160
Before you reject, listen to me first.

155
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,779
If I lose in this battle,

156
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,040
I won’t bother you guys anymore, especially Weir.

157
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,459
I won’t bother you for your entire life.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,540
Are you insane?

159
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,360
Why will we join such a tricky show?

160
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,370
Boss, don’t do it.

161
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,950
Do you promise that if we win,

162
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,000
you won’t bother with Sweet Day Café and Weir ever again?

163
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,950
Boss?

164
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,990
I promise.

165
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,389
I accept the challenge then.

166
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,110
But if I win,

167
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,419
you must close down Sweet Day Café for good.

168
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,629
Dare or not?

169
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:10,360
Sure.

170
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:11,759
Let’s do it.

171
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
Be ready to lose

172
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,779
because Sweet Day Café won’t lose this time.

173
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:41,929
Are you crazy, Uncle?

174
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,740
Why did you dare to accept his challenge?

175
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,120
If we lose,	we have to close down.

176
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,759
Don’t worry.

177
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Our café will win for sure.

178
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,340
I’m confident in our skill and our dessert’s taste.

179
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,080
But Jean is the professor who taught me.

180
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,220
I’ve learned every technique from him.

181
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,840
It’s almost impossible for us to beat him.

182
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,990
Though you learned everything from him,

183
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:16,279
you created the recipe for our desserts here on your own, didn’t you?

184
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,509
Boss, but…

185
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,480
Be confident.

186
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,330
This is your chance to beat him.

187
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,429
You keep running away,

188
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,919
giving in and avoiding him like this.

189
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,919
You want to be like what you used to be, huh?

190
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,259
Now, you’re not fighting for this alone like you were before.

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,759
You have us here.

192
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,620
Don’t worry.

193
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,159
He’s right, Chef.

194
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,639
We can help you this time.

195
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,429
Though I don’t know how to make desserts,

196
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,529
I’ll be rooting for you.

197
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,720
Alright.

198
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,429
Let’s do it.

199
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,190
Let’s get it.

200
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,149
For our Sweet Day.

201
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,789
One, two, yeah!

202
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:45,789
Fight on!

203
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,960
When did Mr. Tert start having hallucinations about his late son?

204
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,120
About a year after his death.

205
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,710
But his condition was never this bad.

206
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,870
There’s no time he didn’t come home like this.

207
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:15,360
Now, I don’t want you all to jump to conclusions.

208
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,190
We need further investigation to confirm this

209
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,600
because some information doesn’t quite match up.

210
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,700
You’re right.

211
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:28,860
The list of the kids that died and were kidnapped also includes girls,

212
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,149
which doesn’t match with Tert’s behaviors.

213
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:37,210
He often has hallucinations about his son who already died,

214
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,230
so he kidnapped Mr. Punn back then.

215
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,289
I think it doesn’t sound quite reasonable for him to kidnap girls.

216
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,509
Anyway, please don’t worry too much.

217
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,559
Our team will search for Tert as soon as possible.

218
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,529
Alright.	Thank you

219
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:20,460
Young master!

220
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:20,990
What?!

221
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:22,889
What’s wrong?

222
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,909
I can’t find our café’s key.

223
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,440
It’s in the counter’s drawer.

224
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,850
But it’s not in there.

225
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,009
I already pulled the drawer out to find it,

226
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,419
What’s going on in my house?

227
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,419
Chef?

228
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:15,440
Chef, wake up.

229
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,149
I’m sorry.

230
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,940
I guess I accidentally fell asleep

231
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,639
while trying to come up with a recipe for our battle with Jean.

232
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,639
How is it?

233
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,639
What did you come up with?

234
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,179
The only way for us to beat Jean in such a short time of preparation like this

235
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,789
is to use a special ingredient which is outstanding and cutting-edge.

236
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,620
And what is it then?

237
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,240
Rhubarb.

238
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,519
Well, what’s that again?

239
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,519
Rhubarb.

240
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,309
It’s a vegetable.

241
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,580
We can use its stalks to make a dessert.

242
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,470
Its uniqueness is its distinguished sour taste.

243
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,279
Its color is reddish pink,

244
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,419
which increases appetite.

245
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,259
More importantly,

246
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,259
as far as I could remember,

247
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,409
Jean never used Rhubarb for his dessert before.

248
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,700
But…

249
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,240
But what?

250
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,750
Rhubarb is not widely popular in Asia,

251
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,399
including in Thailand,

252
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,210
so I don’t know where to find it.

253
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
There’s nothing that Punnapat Dechrachatanan can’t find.

254
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,159
Baby boy!

255
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,399
My baby boy!

256
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,519
Mommy!

257
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,399
I missed you a lot.

258
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,090
Me too.

259
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,720
I’m bringing Rhubarb for you here.

260
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,480
I ordered them directly from Chiang Mai.

261
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Its stalks are so red,

262
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,909
exactly like you requested.

263
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,779
Did you buy them all from the whole field?

264
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,480
Baby boy, more is better than less.

265
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,559
If you need anything else, just let me know.

266
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,830
Are you alright, Chef?

267
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,590
Just a slight cut.

268
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,649
I’m alright.

269
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,000
Try it.

270
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,539
This is not yet right!

271
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,460
It’s our first time making this.

272
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,980
It’s alright, Chef.

273
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,799
Let’s improve it little by little.

274
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,980
But I can’t think of any other way to make it tastier.

275
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,799
Relax, Chef.

276
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,089
I’m sorry, Krating.

277
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,960
You’re distressed because of Jean, right?

278
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,049
He hasn’t let go of me.

279
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,250
I can’t escape from him.

280
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,940
In the end, I guess I must go back to what I used to be.

281
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,720
SS, Chef.

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
It’s an abbreviation of the words stupid and silly.

283
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,809
Mone once told me this.

284
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,599
It’s not that you can’t escape,

285
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,690
but it’s because you choose not to.

286
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,019
Nobody can force you, Chef.

287
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,609
But you don’t know Jean like I do.

288
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,190
He must get whatever he wants.

289
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,220
He’s ready to do everything for what he wants.

290
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,359
You can be the first person who rejects him.

291
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,779
Love is not as easy as what we could say.

292
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,119
Our relationship is more complicated than you can imagine.

293
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,539
Love is between two people.

294
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,130
If the third and the fourth person are involved,

295
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,359
it can’t be called love.

296
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,539
It’s called selfishness.

297
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:54,619
Jean!

298
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:56,539
Why are you here?!

299
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,539
Get out of here already!

300
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,680
I told you not to step in here ever again, didn’t I?

301
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:08,700
I don’t care.

302
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,700
I’m here to talk to Weir.

303
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,309
Talk to my foot instead, will you?

304
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,539
Enough.

305
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,960
Weir, do you remember this day?

306
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,930
It was the first time we met each other.

307
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,940
I…

308
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,779
Hey, our battle is just around the corner.

309
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,549
We’re rivals now,

310
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,319
so please leave.

311
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,910
I’m Sweet Day Café’s rival,

312
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,990
not Weir’s.

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,319
I will never become Weir’s rival

314
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,480
because I love him.

315
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,599
Weir, please come with me

316
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,390
for the sake of our love.

317
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,140
Please.

318
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,420
Please, darling.

319
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,319
Alright.

320
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,259
Let’s go, darling.

321
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,960
I’m afraid Chef will fall for Jean again.

322
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
Just let him learn by himself.

323
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,170
It’s no use for us to keep worrying, is it?

324
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,569
He doesn’t love Chef.

325
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:51,930
He just loves himself.

326
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:53,930
If he decides to go back to that relationship,

327
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,900
what we can do is to accept his decision.

328
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,369
Right?

329
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,299
Though we know that it’s a wrong decision?

330
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,430
This is what love is.

331
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,480
Like what people say, right?

332
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,480
Love blinds us.

333
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,000
Those who are blinded by love are besotted.

334
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,359
True love can’t blind anyone.

335
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,500
Hey, your words are cool these days.

336
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,750
The longer you stay with me,

337
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,880
the more my handsome,

338
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,619
cooler and smarter shades continue to shine.

339
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,059
Guys,

340
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,859
I’m bringing my friends at school and my teachers to have desserts here.

341
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,680
Why didn’t you tell me that you would come?

342
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,599
Well, Meena’s mom is now doing some errands,

343
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,480
so I accompany Meena.

344
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,920
This is Meena, my best friend,

345
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,400
and this is Mesa, her little sister.

346
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:06,970
Welcome.

347
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,039
Here’s our menu.

348
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,420
Today, beautiful teacher Im-Aim is also here.

349
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
You came to take care of your students,

350
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
or is it just that you wanted to come here?

351
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,799
Both.

352
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,279
Isn’t it because you came to see me?

353
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,789
Here’s alcohol spray to kill germs.

354
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,720
Thanks.

355
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,200
Or you can use it to get rid of this pervert uncle.

356
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,079
Like this.

357
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,519
Krating!

358
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:44,599
It’s wet.

359
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,599
Is Punn really the owner of this café?

360
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,190
He is the real owner here.

361
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,789
Darling.

362
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:03,930
Why don’t we go to a fine restaurant and talk there?

363
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,589
I want to talk here.

364
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,769
I don’t want to go anywhere far.

365
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,369
But I know one restaurant with such a nice and romantic vibe.

366
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,690
After dinner, I’ll take you to the club

367
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,670
and accompany you all night long.

368
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,880
Alright?

369
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,279
Jean.

370
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:29,690
This is how you always are.

371
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,200
That’s why we can never keep this relationship.

372
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,029
Let’s not fight, darling.

373
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,390
Let’s talk nicely.

374
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,559
Didn’t you say we would talk nicely?

375
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,759
How can I talk to the person who thinks that the world revolves around him?

376
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,000
We can never understand each other.

377
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,460
You’re selfish.

378
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,569
You only love yourself.

379
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,529
But I also love you, Weir.

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,160
What about your wife and kids?

381
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,509
That’s another matter, Weir.

382
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,119
It’s the same matter, Jean!

383
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,119
Don’t be selfish like this.

384
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,167
What do you want me to do then?

385
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:14,912
Do you want me to divorce my wife?

386
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:18,736
Jean!

387
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,079
You still can’t reflect on yourself, huh?

388
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,695
I don’t want to think about anything.

389
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,807
I only know that I love you, Weir.

390
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,152
Why do you love me?

391
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,647
Does love need any reason?

392
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,144
Love is based on feelings.

393
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:42,288
I feel that I love you,

394
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:43,263
so it means I do.

395
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:48,599
Weir, can we get back together?

396
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:48,607
Weir, can we get back together?Like we used to when we were in France.

397
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:50,000
Like we used to when we were in France.

398
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Jean.

399
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,488
We’re no longer young like we were back then.

400
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:57,311
You are still being childish.

401
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:02,544
No matter what,

402
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,672
we can’t make up, right?

403
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,647
Are we really going to compete?

404
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:13,392
I think I’ve found the love that suits me.

405
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,887
It’s the love from Sweet Day Café’s peeps.

406
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,056
Fine.

407
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:24,847
Alright.

408
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,544
Be ready to be disappointed

409
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,279
because I’ll be making croquembouche.

410
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,096
Do you still remember it?

411
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,448
It’s the dessert that made you fall for me.

412
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,016
That’s lovely.

413
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,415
Mesa, let’s take a photo together.

414
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,160
This one.
Alright.

415
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:08,700
Come here.

416
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:12,816
It’s scary.

417
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,809
That so-called sweet murderer.

418
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,183
Luckily, Mesa is safe,

419
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:21,920
but the pain in her heart must still be with her.

420
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:23,359
Mr. Punn.

421
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,415
Are you alright?

422
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:29,935
When I was young,

423
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:33,519
I was kidnapped like Mesa was.

424
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,519
Did they manage to arrest the kidnapper?

425
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,519
They didn’t.

426
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:40,511
Do you remember the kidnapper’s face?

427
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,271
Young master,

428
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:47,960
if you’re not feeling well,

429
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:47,968
if you’re not feeling well,then you don’t have to say anymore.

430
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:49,039
then you don’t have to say anymore.

431
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,784
Mesa has this kind of condition too.

432
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:57,311
Teacher Aim and I are trying to relieve her from it.

433
00:26:57,776 --> 00:27:01,215
Recently, Mesa doesn’t allow anyone to stay close to her,

434
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,279
except for her sister and Piglet.

435
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,872
Kids this age should be lively and energetic.

436
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,480
Seeing Mesa without any smile like this,

437
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,304
I’m totally in sorrow.

438
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,407
You came home so late, Chef.

439
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:35,400
Have you all been waiting for me?

440
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,400
Nope.

441
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,240
Why are you still awake then?

442
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:44,528
I thought it’s the thief,

443
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:45,743
so I came out to check.

444
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,720
That’s not sneaky enough, uncle.

445
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:52,000
Are you alright, Weir?

446
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:53,903
Is there anything that makes you feel unease?

447
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:57,087
Well,

448
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:02,256
it’s about our battle with Jean.

449
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,170
I think…

450
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,175
I think…Making desserts is your happiness, right?

451
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:07,359
Making desserts is your happiness, right?

452
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,864
Then don’t let anyone ruin your happiness.

453
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,920
If you can’t make it happily,

454
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,407
then you can never pass happiness on to those who eat it.

455
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:19,711
True.

456
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:22,415
Let’s make desserts with happiness.

457
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:26,576
Desserts help produce Morphine.

458
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,352
That’s Endorphins.

459
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:37,536
I’ve already forgot why I love to make desserts.

460
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:43,887
Thanks for reminding me what my true happiness is.

461
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:50,784
I promise I’ll definitely make those who eat my desserts happy.

462
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,968
Thanks a lot, guys.

463
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,864
Mesa, you take one,

464
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,935
and I take one.

465
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,579
Let’s compete.

466
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:05,584
Let’s compete.The person who gets 5 points first wins.

467
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:07,359
The person who gets 5 points first wins.

468
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,023
Mesa, go stand right there.

469
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,152
I’ll stand here.

470
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:12,190
Alright?

471
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,192
Alright?Alright.

472
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:12,759
Alright.

473
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:12,768
Alright.Here you are.

474
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:13,776
Here you are.

475
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:14,816
Let’s go

476
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,728
One, two, three!
I feel sorry for Mesa.

477
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:23,839
She must be suffering because of that incident.

478
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:25,663
That’s right,

479
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:28,976
but she’s feeling better now.

480
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,743
Really?

481
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,855
It’s a relief hearing this.

482
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:36,190
If this happened to our family,

483
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,192
If this happened to our family,I would suffer so much from it.

484
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,640
I would suffer so much from it.

485
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:40,640
No way.

486
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:44,079
I’ll surely handle that kidnapper.

487
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,079
What a cool girl.

488
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,695
I’m cool like you are, mom.

489
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,231
Piglet, let’s play badminton.

490
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:52,223
Sure.

491
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,000
Mom, let’s play.

492
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:57,930
Ready?

493
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:57,935
Ready?One, two, three, go!

494
00:29:57,935 --> 00:30:00,336
One, two, three, go!

495
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,663
Can we stop playing already?

496
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:06,460
Come on, Piglet.

497
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,463
Come on, Piglet.I won, right?

498
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:07,759
I won, right?

499
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,327
Nope, I was just pulling my punch.

500
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:11,710
Actually, I’m so good at it.

501
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:11,711
Actually, I’m so good at it.One, two, three!

502
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,895
One, two, three!

503
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:21,455
What’s up, kid?

504
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,450
Have we met before?

505
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:27,215
Do I look familiar to you?

506
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,039
I saw you around the school often, uncle.

507
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:36,559
I just want to protect you.

508
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:41,311
Don’t be scared.

509
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:47,807
Mesa!

510
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:49,789
Mesa, where are you?

511
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:49,791
Mesa, where are you?I’m here.

512
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,816
I’m here.

513
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,440
What’s up, Mone?

514
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:28,175
I’m calling to give you a cheering message.

515
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:29,951
I’m afraid you will be so nervous that

516
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,695
you might cause Chef Weir to make a mistake.

517
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,407
Hey, I was in this show before.

518
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,192
But you lost.

519
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,167
I’ve heard that we got robbed,

520
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,599
and you were the one who told me, didn’t you?

521
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,912
Will this dumb show cheat us again this time?

522
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,680
I think they won’t.

523
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
That’s why I’m not there now.

524
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:55,000
It’s quite strange

525
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,008
It’s quite strangethat you don’t come to root for Chef here.

526
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,640
that you don’t come to root for Chef here.

527
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,488
I have work to manage,

528
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,615
but just don’t worry about my business now.

529
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,240
What I want to tell you is that

530
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,816
the show doesn’t dare to cheat this time

531
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,528
because they’re already confident that Jean is going to win.

532
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:20,109
That’s overconfident.

533
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:20,112
That’s overconfident.I’ll make them shocked.

534
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,711
I’ll make them shocked.

535
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:24,655
This time, I’m also confident.

536
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,680
I’ll bring the cake that we make and win

537
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,263
in this whatever sweet show to you to taste.

538
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:32,208
The show is called The Sweetest Shop.

539
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,460
I’ll hang up now.

540
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:34,463
I’ll hang up now.I’m tired of a bragger.

541
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:35,647
I’m tired of a bragger.

542
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:02,269
Guys, The Sweetest Shop’s special battle today is welcoming a new face competitor

543
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:02,271
Guys, The Sweetest Shop’s special battle today is welcoming a new face competitorwhose qualification is no joke.

544
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,839
whose qualification is no joke.

545
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,663
He is a world-class pastry chef.

546
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:08,750
That’s right.

547
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:08,751
That’s right.Today, Chef Jean,

548
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:09,819
Today, Chef Jean,

549
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:09,824
Today, Chef Jean,Sarid Pongpaiboon, is joining us!

550
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:12,160
Sarid Pongpaiboon, is joining us!

551
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,240
Let’s give him a round of applause!

552
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:20,220
The other team joined us in the battle before.

553
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,223
The other team joined us in the battle before.They’re a new eager beaver team

554
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:21,503
They’re a new eager beaver team

555
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,500
that we mustn’t miss keeping an eye on.

556
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,423
Sweet Day Café!

557
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,432
They’re here again for a return match.

558
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,912
The rule for this battle is that we have no rule at all.

559
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:40,192
Our show allows both teams to freely create any dessert of their choice.

560
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:43,135
Both teams have prepared themselves and selected the menu in advance.

561
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,976
Since they’re all ready,

562
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,463
let’s get started!

563
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,720
Chef, what’s the dessert you’re making today?

564
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:57,807
Rhubarb tart.

565
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,087
Rhubarb is a rare ingredient in Thailand.

566
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,420
I want Thai people to try this tart,

567
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,423
I want Thai people to try this tart,which gives a cutting-edge taste.

568
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:06,970
which gives a cutting-edge taste.

569
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:06,976
which gives a cutting-edge taste.Anyone who eats this will surely be filled with happiness.

570
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,503
Anyone who eats this will surely be filled with happiness.

571
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:19,632
Today, your menu is called?

572
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,559
Croquembouche.

573
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,295
Croquembouche?

574
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,423
Why did you choose this dessert, Chef?

575
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:28,864
Because it’s the dessert that made someone fall for me.

576
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,088
[Weir & Krating]

577
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,775
But I can’t think of any other way to make it tastier.

578
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,128
I will never become Weir’s rival

579
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,208
because I love him.

580
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:12,255
Making desserts is your happiness, right?

581
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,496
Then don’t let anyone ruin your happiness.

582
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,648
If you can’t make it happily,

583
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,007
then you can never pass happiness on to those who eat it.

584
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:11,775
Now, you’re not fighting for this alone like you were before.

585
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:14,224
You have us here.

586
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,327
This time, we can help you.

587
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,400
Though I don’t know how to make desserts,

588
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,632
I’ll be rooting for you.

589
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,119
It looks great.

590
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,079
Let’s taste it.

591
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,896
It’s so tasty.

592
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,949
I didn’t expect that you would combine Thai Pandan Custard with a French dessert.

593
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:31,952
I didn’t expect that you would combine Thai Pandan Custard with a French dessert.It’s such a perfect combination.

594
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,407
It’s such a perfect combination.

595
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:37,000
Apart from its wonderful design,

596
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,210
its taste is also fabulous.

597
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,215
its taste is also fabulous.I’m just speechless.

598
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,769
I’m just speechless.

599
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:41,775
I’m just speechless.All I can say is that it’s perfect.

600
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:44,032
All I can say is that it’s perfect.

601
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,351
Thanks.

602
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:53,168
Croquembouche that I made today is commonly used as a wedding cake in France,

603
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,568
but on top of that, the message I want to deliver through it

604
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,695
is the passionate love,

605
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,255
filled with passionately tempting charms.

606
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:07,103
Its grandiose design makes everyone want to taste it at least once in his life.

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,248
It’s like the love at first sight that everyone is dreaming of.

608
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,679
Well, let’s try it.

609
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:21,952
It seems I must close our café.

610
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,568
Close our café now to celebrate!

611
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:30,768
We’ve won!!!

612
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,623
Uncle,

613
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,295
you have been shouting like this since you were at the show.

614
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,815
This is the first award for our café.

615
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,447
Guys, thanks for making me pull myself together.

616
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,311
You must thank me for that

617
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,536
since I was the one who reminded you.

618
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,047
Well then,

619
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,920
I will give you a reward by hugging you.

620
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:02,496
Hey, you can give me other stuff as a reward.

621
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:06,639
Boss, you didn’t go with the flow at all.

622
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:08,000
Hug Krating.

623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,735
He’s waiting.

624
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:13,791
Or do you want to bite an apple?

625
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:17,360
You’re bullying me!

626
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,431
Why did Weir take leave on such a busy day like this?

627
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,695
It’s his sister’s wedding day.

628
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,690
What are you worried about?

629
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,047
Many people are here to help you.

630
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,039
Mesa, it’s yummy, right?

631
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:59,407
Rhubarb tart like you made yesterday, please.

632
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:00,559
Two, please.

633
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:32,016
Thanks everyone for being my happiness.

634
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,527
Make him go wild seeing this photo.

635
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,568
To return the favor for the friendship you all have given me,

636
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,329
I will live my life happily,

637
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:01,840
and I will give happiness back to everyone.

638
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:13,583
From now, I hope we can deliver happiness to every customer who drops by.

639
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,255
Though it’s just a little happiness,

640
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:25,615
it’s the feelings filled with our friendship’s sweetness.

641
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,927
This kind of sweetness can only be found at Sweet Day Café.
