Chef,

please let me be your protégé.

MOM and DAD.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,439
What is it, dear?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,259
I think I’ve found something.

7
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,179
Last night, someone found the body of a child vendor kidnapped a few days ago.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,859
Next to her body

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,920
was a dessert bag from your café.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,480
Help!

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,460
Where are you going?

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,020
Stop, you murderer!

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,960
I’m not a murderer.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
This guy is my bodyguard.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,060
Huh?

16
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,700
Mone

17
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,060
Yes?

18
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,920
This is quite bitter.

19
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,040
Like love,

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,340
it’s both bitter and sweet.

21
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,459
I’ve tasted the bitter part.

22
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,159
Where’s the sweet?

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,699
Oops, is this too sweet for you, Mone?

What is it?

32
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,439
What’s wrong, dear?

33
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,280
There. There.

34
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,180
You’re such a good mom.

35
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,560
You always rush to calm her down every time she has a nightmare.

36
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,319
What was the dream? Can you tell me, dear?

37
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,099
I dreamed that I got cake slammed in my face.

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,300
Cake slammed in your face?

39
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,219
Cake slammed in the face.

40
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,180
What?

41
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,439
Cake slammed in the face. I’ve never heard it before.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,560
Cake slammed in the face.

43
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,500
Cake is 8.

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,860
That’s fine. I’ll ask the lady next door.

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,280
By the way, think carefully, dear.

46
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,159
Was there any number that you saw in your dream?

47
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,099
Well, well. I thought you’re worried about our daughter

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,979
when in fact you want to get lottery numbers

49
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,500
Do not belittle my ability to interpret lottery numbers.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,980
Because of the lottery, our roof is no longer leaking.

51
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,300
No,

52
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,300
because I used the lottery tickets to patch the roof.

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,620
Good thing I didn’t win so there were a lot of tickets lying around.

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,579
I can’t believe I woke up to this.

55
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,220
I’m going to take a shower.

56
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,959
Let me jot something down.

57
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,560
Numbers?

58
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,680
A joke. We can play this one again.

59
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:56,899
(What’s up with her?)

60
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,519
(I don’t know.)

61
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,540
Mom, why don’t we have desserts in our house?

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,180
Well, I…

63
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,819
It’s OK. I’ll go out and buy some for us.

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,480
See you later.

65
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,399
What’s up with her?

66
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,180
Or?

67
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,480
She’s in love. That must be it, daddy

68
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,680
ust like the two of us.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,740
Oh, please!

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,860
Our special menus today are lemon tart and choux

71
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,160
Choux cream.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,540
Miss.

73
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,220
Hello?

74
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,139
Miss.

75
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,079
Oh, may I have a piece of lemon tart, please.

76
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,079
One lemon tart.

77
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,639
Ah!

78
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,199
Uncle, the customers are scared off.

79
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,199
Tell your bodyguard to stop doing that.

80
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,160
They’re all gone

81
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,560
Pooh, you lurking around the café are scaring off our customers.

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,860
I’m sorry, Young Master.

83
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,879
I won’t do it anymore.

84
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,939
Do not scold him like that.

85
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,180
He meant no harm.

86
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,959
How about this? You don’t need to follow me around

87
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,360
I stay here most of the time anyway. Nothing will happen.

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,220
But, Young Master,

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,680
it’s my job to take care of you to the best of my ability.

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,100
I swore that I wouldn’t let you out of my sight ever again.

91
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,980
Wait for me in the car.

92
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,980
I’ll pack up and follow soon.

93
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,779
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:36,660
I’m fine.

95
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,579
Uncle, why would you hire someone like that to be a bodyguard?

96
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,079
Because it's the only thing he can do.

97
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,279
Eat it.

98
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,079
A child should obey an adult.

99
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,500
Eat!

100
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,720
Eat it up!

101
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,079
Argh!

102
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:50,659
I can see it.

103
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,320
I can see his face.

104
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,960
Young Master! Please help me!

105
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Young Master! Young Master! Please help me!

106
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,360
Fire. Fire. It’s hot.

107
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Put it out! Put it out!

108
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,659
The fire is hot. Young Master, it’s hot!

109
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,879
I told you not to use fire.

110
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,759
Were you going to burn down my house?

111
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,340
I just wanted to fry an egg for you to eat.

112
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,220
Here it is.

113
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,879
Nobody can eat that.

114
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,899
I can’t do anything.

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,700
I can neither cook nor take care of Young Master.

116
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,559
I’m worthless.

117
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,379
Stop, don’t cry.

118
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,779
You can go back to what you’re doing before.

119
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,159
Whatever you want.

120
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,059
If you want to look after me, you can look from afar,

121
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,179
from a very far distance.

122
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,299
I will do my best to take care of you from a far distance

123
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,039
without you or any customer realizing it.

124
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,519
Please excuse me.

125
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
I’m fine.

126
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,080
Pooh seems to care about you very much.

127
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,600
I don’t why he would be so worried.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,480
I’m in my 30s, but he treats me like a child.

129
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,419
How did you and your bodyguard meet?

130
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,740
Well, I met him 20 years ago.

131
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,840
Pooh and his mom used to get beat up by his abusive father.

132
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,980
One day they couldn’t take it anymore and ran away.

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,720
My family took him in.

134
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,019
Hi, my name is Punn. What’s yours?

135
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,519
My name is Pooh.

136
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,139
Pooh, let’s be friends from now on.

137
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,220
Pooh and I were raised together.

138
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,159
He’s both my brother and my best friend.

139
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,059
After his mom passed,

140
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,220
my family raised him, paid for his schooling and everything.

141
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,019
The way I see him, he’s nothing but a family member.

142
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:43,899
He’s like my blood brother.

143
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,159
But why would your brother call you Young Master?

144
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,379
Bodyguard, you betrayed me! Bang! Bang! Bang!

145
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,799
Why didn’t you shoot me back?

146
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,820
I can’t shoot you. A bodyguard must protect Young Master.

147
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,879
But in the story, you’re a bodyguard who betrayed Young Master.

148
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,279
I would never betray Young Master. My life belongs to you.

149
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,639
After he played my bodyguard that time

150
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
he couldn’t get out of the role.

151
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,840
He keeps calling me Young Master, Young Master, Young Master.

152
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,159
You’re back, Young Master.

153
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,320
Are you tired?

154
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,519
I’ve drawn a warm bath with soap and bubbles for you.

155
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,059
Shall we take a bath?

156
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,440
No one knows me as well as you do, Pooh.

157
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,720
I’m giving you a back rub today, our usual routine.

158
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,080
Weir.

159
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,519
You’re thinking about something dirty, right? Stop it right now.

160
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,460
It’s hard not to ship Pooh and you.

161
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,860
We have a customer. She’s beautiful.

162
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,159
You stay here. Let me.

163
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,759
Welcome to our café.

164
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,919
Why don’t we get to work?

165
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,019
Yes, Chef.

166
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,419
Pooh is quite cute, actually.

167
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
The mirror doesn’t work again.

168
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,539
The garage must’ve tricked me.

169
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,200
Or is it the cloth?

170
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,960
Young Master, I can’t see you.

171
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,720
Please come by next time to snap a photo with me to check in.

172
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,179
I’m the landmark of this place.

173
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,620
My brother, all he can do is to keep watch.

174
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,919
Argh! Help! Help!

175
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:12,700
Young Master!

176
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,179
Don’t be scared.

177
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,419
I’ll be by your side.

178
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,580
Young Master.

179
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,980
You startled me. What is it?

180
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,720
Are you hungry? Do you want me to get you dinner?

181
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,340
Sure. But you should go inside, you’re soaking wet.

182
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,940
OK.

183
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,960
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

184
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,519
I’m fine.

185
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,500
Pooh will go out and get some food.

186
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,419
Do you guys want anything?

187
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,220
I’d go to Uttaradit if I had to.

188
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,899
Why Uttaradit?

189
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,820
It sounds challenging.

190
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,600
Uttaradit.

191
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,360
No need to go far.

192
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,620
Fried pork garlic on rice and a fried egg on our street is good enough for me.

193
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,899
Can I have fried mixed vegetables with pork on rice.

194
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,940
No carrot. Just cabbage and Chinese broccoli.

195
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,379
I also need extra eggs. Medium-boiled eggs to be exact.

196
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,019
Pooh.

197
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,159
Are you OK?

198
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,059
Medium-boiled eggs.

199
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,600
He’s overloaded. He doesn’t have enough RAM.

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Can you order something simpler?

201
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
He can’t remember your order.

202
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,940
I’m sorry.

203
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,059
How about this? I’ll buy dinner for Chef.

204
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,119
Bodyguard Uncle can buy dinner for Creepy Uncle.

205
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey!

206
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,779
Who is this Creepy Uncle you referred to?

207
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,359
I’ll have a pork hamburger.

208
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,519
Yes, Young Master. You can trust me.

209
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,779
Which branch should I get it from?

210
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,880
The nearest. No need to go to Uttaradit.

211
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:39,579
OK.

212
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,480
Boss, has Pooh always been like this?

213
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,559
Are you talking about what just happened?

214
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,279
He’s always been like this.

215
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,500
When you talk to him, go slow.

216
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,500
He’s a slow person.

217
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,940
You care about him.

218
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,259
You’re a good boss.

219
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,539
Boss, Krating didn’t take any umbrella.

220
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,539
He’ll come back soaking wet.

221
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,720
Shall we bring him an umbrella?

222
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,740
Our café will be wet.

223
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,380
I need to wipe it dry again.

224
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,720
He complains but he cares.

225
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,339
Pooh, why are you all wet?

226
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,960
I got the burger. I parked the car.

227
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,460
When I got back, I got the ticket and the wheels were locked.

228
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,880
You need to take this ticket to the police station and pay the fine.

229
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,700
The police will then release the lock.

230
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,759
Thank you.

231
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,599
Pooh!

232
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,079
Are you OK?

233
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,720
I’m fine.

234
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,579
This is bad. He’s just my type.

235
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,019
Mr. Weir, are you all right?

236
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,539
Pooh, you’re already wet.

237
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,420
Let’s play in the rain.

238
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,660
(No, I can’t. Got caught up in the moment.)

239
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,779
(But I can’t do this. The café would be in trouble.)

240
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,759
(But why is he so damn cute?)

241
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
(No, you can’t, Weir. You can’t.)

242
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:42,920
That’s right.

243
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,420
Coach.

244
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:58,059
What’s up? Where are you headed to with all your stuff?

245
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,640
I’m leaving the boxing camp today.

246
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,700
Why would you leave, Krating?

247
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,019
You can stay here. This place is like your home.

248
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,779
I can’t continue living here, Coach.

249
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,980
It hurts me to see everyone…

250
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,160
Where will you go?

251
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,799
You don’t have to worry about that, Coach.

252
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,519
I’ll find my way.

253
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,779
Remember this.

254
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,140
You may not be a boxer, but this place always welcomes you.

255
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
Thank you for everything, Coach.

256
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,539
What are you going to do next?

257
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,339
I’ll be a pastry chef

258
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,240
A chef?

259
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,500
See you later.

260
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,460
Why is it not as good as Chef’s?

261
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,579
Chef, I did everything according to your recipe.

262
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
But why is it nothing like what you baked?

263
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,339
It tastes fine.

264
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,940
But it’s missing something.

265
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,619
What is it?

266
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,759
Care and attention to detail.

267
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,059
The heart of baking is care in every step.

268
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,259
Attention to every little detail

269
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,700
is what makes our pastry different than others.

270
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,180
Despite using the same ingredients,

271
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,240
a second longer in the oven

272
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,359
or a tad thicker cream

273
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,579
makes all the difference.

274
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,140
Today, I’ll show you how to make a simple dessert,

275
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,259
nothing complicated,

276
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,519
But it requires care in the making.

277
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,220
What is it?

278
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,799
Meringue Kiss.

279
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,039
For meringue,

280
00:24:58,059 --> 00:24:59,680
you use only egg

281
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,759
whites with a little bit of salt.

282
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,480
Whisk well until you see foams.

283
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,839
Add just a little bit of sugar at a time.

284
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,500
You need to make sure

285
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,180
that every sugar granule dissolves.

286
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,480
Then, you add rose water essence

287
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,420
to add a sweet scent to the meringue.

288
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,579
Apart from the taste,

289
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,519
the beauty and aesthetics of baking

290
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,680
are essential elements

291
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,460
that can make a customer happy.

292
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,200
Try it.

293
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,220
Yes.

294
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,160
Wow.

295
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,059
Have a bite.

296
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,000
So good, Chef.

297
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:12,559
Mone,

298
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,420
I thought you’re here to investigate,

299
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,220
but in fact you’re checking out a guy.

300
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,539
It’s nothing like that.

301
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,960
It’s not? You’re not here to check him out?

302
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:21,940
No, I’m not.

303
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,240
I’m here to call dibs on him. Ha!

304
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,720
Mone,

305
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,460
you spend too much time with your family.

306
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,119
Your jokes are dad jokes.

307
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,480
So? I’m both beautiful and funny.

308
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,440
Yet she never gets a guy.

309
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,559
Here you go.

310
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Desserts for beautiful ladies.

311
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,440
No spoons?

312
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,079
There’s no need for any spoon or fork.

313
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,279
Here.

314
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,839
You can use this instead.

315
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,240
My heart. And I’m ready to send it out to everyone.

316
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,839
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

317
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,720
This joke doesn’t fly, huh?

318
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,279
That’s OK.

319
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,660
Our café has many more jokes

320
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,680
to give to beautiful ladies like yourselves.

321
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,519
Do you sell desserts here or what?

322
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,039
We sell many things.

323
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,680
Pastry, cake, tea,

324
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,420
a handsome owner included

325
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,599
And there’s more.

326
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,880
You want more?

327
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,099
There’s nothing more I want than for you to stop.

328
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,200
(It’s not him, right?)

329
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,859
(No.)

330
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,680
Here he comes.

331
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,299
He’s cute indeed.

332
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:34,180
What’s his name?

333
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,059
Chef Weir.

334
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,200
Ahem.

335
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,059
This is our latest product.

336
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,119
If you want to taste it,

337
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,359
take a photo with the handsome owner to check in.

338
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,579
A promotion this good is hard to come by.

339
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:46,779
You can’t find it anywhere else.

340
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,500
Can we switch and take a photo with the chef instead?

341
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes.

342
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
We will snap many photos to post in that case.

343
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,599
You can take a photo with this guy instead.

344
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,680
The chefs here are all good-looking.

345
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,900
The owner is also good-looking.

346
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,279
Handsome, rich, cunning, and upper-class.

347
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,740
ou can take a picture with the owner.

348
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,000
That’s OK. You should attend to other customers.

349
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,079
Our staff can attend to other customers.

350
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,200
The camera cannot focus on the owner.

351
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,480
Can I take a photo of someone else?

352
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:21,740
I can make sure it focuses.

353
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,779
Pooh.

354
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,339
Are you waiting for Boss?

355
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,799
He went back a while ago.

356
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I’m waiting for you, Mr. Weir.

357
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,539
Me?

358
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,059
I’m waiting to take you home.

359
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,160
You’re so cute. How can I resist?

360
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,859
I don’t want to go home yet.

361
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,599
Keen to go out with me?

362
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,599
Where?

363
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,579
Isn’t Weir the bomb?

364
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,160
Hotter than fire.

365
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,779
Mr. Weir is this hot?

366
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,700
Of course. Let me warn you.

367
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,119
If you want to play with fire, be careful or you’ll burn.

368
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Mr. Weir.

369
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:55,740
Pooh, let’s clink our glasses.

370
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,859
Well…

371
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,279
I need to go home soon.

372
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,339
Why?

373
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
Don’t you want to hang out with me?

374
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
It’s not like that.

375
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,819
I need to go home to look after Young Master.

376
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,759
Can’t you take care of me too?

377
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,180
Ah… well…

378
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,160
I’m kidding.

379
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,259
You can go.

380
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,880
I can take care of myself.

381
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,940
Mr. Weir!

382
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,799
I’m all wet now, Pooh.

383
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,960
I can buy you a new shirt.

384
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,359
You don’t need to do that.

385
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,740
I just need to wash this shirt.

386
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,019
Where?

387
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,859
My place.

388
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,720
Mr. Weir. Mr. Weir.

389
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,740
Slowly, Mr. Weir. Here’s your bed.

390
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:23,000
Your pillow.

391
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,460
Mr. Weir, please allow me to take off your shirt and wash it.

392
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,880
You can wash it right here.

393
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,799
I’m sorry, Mr. Weir.

394
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,259
I must be too drunk.

395
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,259
Excuse me.

396
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,259
Oh,

397
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,220
this shirt doesn’t get washed tonight after all.

398
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,420
Where should I sleep tonight?

399
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,539
I can’t stay at the hotel for another night.

400
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,539
I’ll run out of money.

401
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,559
Hmm… how did I circle back to the café?

402
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,299
Boss.

403
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,720
We arrived at the same time.

404
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,140
Does it mean that we are in sync?

405
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,640
It means that you let your imagination run wild.

406
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,160
It’s early in the morning.

407
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,880
You didn’t have to flick my forehead.

408
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:56,720
Krating, is it possible that you come to work early?

409
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,420
I just want to get here early to practice my baking skills.

410
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:08,599
You should be happy to have a diligent worker like me.

411
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,699
Really?

412
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,019
Seeing you try this hard makes .

413
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,940
a teacher like me so proud.

414
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,860
I won’t let you down.

415
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,820
Of course not. What have you made?

416
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,820
You can’t remember the name of the pastry, can you?

417
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,000
No.

418
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,320
I’ll teach you.

419
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,619
Have you come to see me?
want to join us ?

420
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,219
Are you annoyed by me?

421
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,699
You forgot the sunglasses at my place.

422
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,280
You can keep them.

423
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,579
I’ve got many pairs.

424
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,079
That’s fine.

425
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
OK.

426
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:30,800
Here you go.

427
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
For you to eat when you’re hungry.

428
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,960
Thank you.

429
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:47,820
Wow, this is delicious. What is it?

430
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,719
It’s called Meringue Kiss.

431
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,599
Because it’s sweet like a kiss.

432
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,599
Oh, OK.

433
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,280
You’re here again. This way, please.

434
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,940
What would you like to order today?

435
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,840
Ahem, what would you like to order today?

436
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,400
Can I ask Chef Weir to recommend?

437
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,420
I’m his assistant. I can also recommend.

438
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,760
What do you feel like today?

439
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,239
You can tell me.

440
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,780
I’ll have a chocolate cake and hot jasmine tea.

Weir, come out and talk to me.

453
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,219
What’s going on, Mick?

454
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,719
Last night, someone saw you go home with some man.

455
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,119
What does it mean?

456
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,119
Was it him?

457
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,659
I was drunk and he just gave me a lift.

458
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:39,219
Are you sure that’s all he did?

459
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:42,480
Of course. He and I are not lovers.

460
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,940
Pooh, we are just friends, right?

461
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,099
Yes.

462
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,920
It’s obvious that it’s not true.

463
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,480
Huh? What does it mean?

464
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,900
Why did you do that?

465
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,699
Hey!

466
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:11,860
Let me go!

467
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,400
What did you do that for?

468
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,900
Weir.

469
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,300
Boss.

470
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,179
I may have been a jerk to you when we were students.

471
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,139
But it doesn’t mean you can be a jerk to anyone.

472
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,320
I thought you’re a better man.

473
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
How could you do this to Pooh?

474
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,480
Boss, I…

475
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
I’ll give you one more chance.

476
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:50,019
If you don't want to find a new job, apologize to Pooh.

477
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:51,639
Yes.

478
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,280
Weir, how could you let him slap you like that?

479
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,539
Shut up

480
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,280
or I’ll knock all your teeth out.

481
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,079
Get out of my café.

482
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,139
Krating,

483
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
follow me.

484
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,619
(The Sweetest Shop Season 3 )

485
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:39,320
(Coming Soon)

486
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,639
Sweet Day will compete in The Sweetest Shop.

487
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,260
If we win, our café will be the talk of the town.

488
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,340
If I go on the show,

489
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:50,380
who will take care of the café?

490
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,780
These two.

491
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,579
Huh?

492
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,280
t looks good.

493
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,199
Krating,

494
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,619
I can’t believe you’d hang up the gloves

495
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,699
nd do this menial job instead.
