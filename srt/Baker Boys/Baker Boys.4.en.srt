Keen to go out with me?

Pooh, we are just friends, right?

12
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:28,978
Yes.

13
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,350
How could you do this to Pooh?

14
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,978
I’ll give you one more chance.

15
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:37,689
If you don't want to find a new job, apologize to Pooh.

16
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,977
Pooh,

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,668
I apologize.

18
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:20,978
You know what?

19
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,977
Besides Young Master,

20
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,977
you are the first person who is nice to me

21
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,978
and sincerely care about me.

22
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:35,977
Normally, I don’t dare to look into people’s eyes.

23
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,977
But you make me feel at ease and be myself.

24
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,978
That’s why I can look you in the eye.

25
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,977
Pooh,

26
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:01,977
I’m not a nice person as you think I am.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,978
There are many other things you don’t know about me.

28
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,979
If you know another side of me,

29
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,979
you will not feel good about me anymore.

30
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,979
No way.

31
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:21,978
When I have a good feeling about someone,

32
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,978
that feeling will last in me for the rest of my life.

33
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,978
Pooh.

34
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,979
Young Master always tell me…

35
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,979
That you are too good?

36
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:34,979
...that I’m too stupid.

37
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:39,978
Wait a minute.

38
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:43,978
Isn’t this supposed to be the moment of hurt feelings between us?

39
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:45,978
Are your feelings hurt?

40
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,978
I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings.

41
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,978
No. I thought…

42
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:58,492
I thought you were sad because I…

43
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,978
No.

44
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,382
Don’t think too much about it.

45
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,979
I understand.

46
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,978

It’s normal that many men are attracted to you.

I’m happy just watching you from a distance.

50
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:28,979
You don’t feel hurtful or mad at me?

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,979
I’m sorry if I don’t feel hurtful or mad at you.

52
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,788
You don’t need to apologize to me.

53
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,978
It’s me who needs to apologize to you.

54
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:52,979
I was wrong for flirting with you.

55
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:54,979
I’m sorry.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,461
I have never received an apology from anyone before.

57
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,978
I’m so touched.

58
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:20,978
If there are no hard feelings between us,

Yes.

We are almost 24 now.

Since grade 4, you hadn’t been into anyone until you met Weir.

125

But this time, it was over before you could make a move.

126
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:11,918
In grade 4, it was because of you and my parents.

My love was doomed.

Otherwise, I would have had a boyfriend.

00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,979
Come on, dear. It’s not a big deal.

186
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,174
These days, there are many types of love.

187
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,580
That’s right.

188
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
When you fall in love with someone,

189
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,979
no matter who he is.

190
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:06,440
It’s a good thing to have love, isn’t it?

191
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,336
You must hold on to it and keep on.

192
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,979
One day, your love will be fulfilled.

193
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,977
Is there anything I can do to help you?

194
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:15,470
Yes. What can I do?

195
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,586
I can also help you. I’m quite free at the moment.

196
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:20,267
I can check when Chef Weir is off work.

197
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,977
Just tell me what you want me to do.

198
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,273
Everyone, stop.

199
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:26,552
Stop. Stop. Stop.

200
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,778
Enough. Please stay away from this matter.

201
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,676
I don’t want the incident when I was in grade 4 to repeat.

202
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:37,738
You all teamed up and told me to confess Kunanon in front of the flag.

203
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,765
Look what you’ve done to me.

204
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:43,977
I still remember that embarrassing moment until now.

205
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,977
Okay, I’ll back off.

206
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:48,977
But…

207
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,620
you must do your best and never give up.

208
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,979
Try to win over Chef Weir’s heart.

209
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,695
Because love conquers all.

210
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:02,485
Yes. Love needs no reason and it can happen any moment.

211
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:06,979
Do you all think so?

212
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:12,561
PH:	No.

213
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:14,339
No customers.

214
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,206
No customers.

215
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,201
No customers.

216
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,977
No cus…

217
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,980
Uncle Bodyguard,

218
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,407
I told you to welcome customers

219
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:40,407
not to chase them away.

220
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,759
Why are you tearing up?

221
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:48,979
I didn’t mean to chase them.

222
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:54,979
What’s going on? A thief?

223
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,977
Nothing, ma’am. Please come this way.

224
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,977
Chef is not here today?

225
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,979
You didn’t see him, did you?

226
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,816
Come on. You only ask for Chef Weir.

227
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,977
Are you here to have desserts or something else?

228
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,979
Do you have a problem with that?

229
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,977
Or you don’t want to welcome a customer like me?

230
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:27,538
We do welcome you.

231
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:31,489
Our customers make our café survive in the business.

232
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,489
We are truly grateful to you.

233
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,171
Please come again and again.

234
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,450
But for the desserts, not something else.

235
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:43,977
Well then, can I have…

236
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:48,789
Cane Sugar Caramel and Cinnamon Brownies

237
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,789
with earl grey tea, please.

238
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:59,977
Uh...it has sold out.

239
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:02,979
Would you like to have something else instead?

240
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,811
No. I only want that.

241
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,956
It’s not that hard to make.

242
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,977
The assistant chef should be able to bake it.

243
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,979
Or...you don’t know how.

244
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,450
That simple dessert is no brainer.

245
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,976
Okay. I can’t wait to taste it.

246
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,977
Do you know how to make it?

247
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,423
I don’t, Uncle.

248
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,568
What should we do, then?

249
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,977
I have no idea what that thing is.

250
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:48,979
Boss.

251
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:50,979
Can I drop out?

252
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:52,979
I’m camera-shy.

253
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,211
I’m really nervous right now.

254
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,979
But you are so ballsy when you go clubbing.

255
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,977
Come on, Boss. It’s not the same.

256
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,529
There are many females here. Look.

257
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:26,980
Here you go.

258
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:29,978
Don’t be afraid.

259
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,750
I’m not leaving you to fight alone.

260
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,511
If you get shaky, just turn back and look at me.

261
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,511
You can look at me as long as you want.

262
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,978
You want to use your face to calm me?

263
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:45,978
Yes. If it helps, I don’t mind.

264
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:50,979
And your scarf, wear it properly.

265
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,478
Can you help fix it for me, Boss?

266
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:58,979
You are unbelievable.

267
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,979
Finish it yourself.

268
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,410
I’m just teasing you for fun.

269
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,861
And the first test for this week is

270
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:46,866
the dessert with chocolate ingredients.

271
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:51,934
All contestants must use the ingredients we have provided on the center table.

272
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:55,695
So please scan through them all and think of what you want to use.

273
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,979
If you are ready, you may start!

274
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:16,490
Chef Weir seems to have some problems.

275
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,979
He hasn’t come out of his station and picked any ingredient.

276
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:26,943
All good ingredients have been taken away one by one.

277
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:29,978
If you don’t hurry, there might be nothing left.

278
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,979
It looks pretty good.

279
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,979
Absolutely. It was made by Krating.

280
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:10,979
Try it, Uncle.

281
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:34,979
It’s very sweet.

282
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,979
It has cane sugar.

283
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,977
It must be sweet.

284
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,978
If we have the whole piece, we may have diabetes.

285
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:49,978
All contestants,

286
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,979
time is running out.

287
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:54,979
Please speed up.

288
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:00,979
5

289
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:02,430
4

290
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:03,978
3

291
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:05,121
2

292
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,978
1

293
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:08,979
Time’s up. Please raise your hands.

294
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:23,978
Chef, please explain your creation.

295
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:27,978
I named this cake “Rich Dark Chocolate Cake.”

296
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,730
I would like to represent the true flavor of chocolate through this cake.

297
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,611
So I used 70% dark chocolate for the ganache.

298
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:38,924
It will give a bittersweet taste.

299
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,762
I added a crunchy and aromatic element with hazelnuts and walnuts.

300
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:46,979
So this cake gives you a rich chocolate flavor, not just typical chocolate cake.

301
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:50,472
I think the cake texture has been very well crafted.

302
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,529
The filling inside is not too runny or too thick.

303
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:56,897
Don’t you think it’s too ordinary?

304
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,978
You just melted chocolate and recreated it

305
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,979
while the other contestants incorporated it in their makings.

306
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,979
I find it’s too basic.

307
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,979
Let’s taste it, then.

308
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,978
The texture of the sponge is heavy but not too heavy.

309
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:28,705
The flavor is just right. It’s sweet with a nice touch of bitterness at the end.

310
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:30,723
I like the crunchiness I get.

311
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:33,978
And the nuts are very well blended with the filling.

312
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,979
The taste of this cake is very good.

313
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,979
Thank you.

314
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,978
They must be a couple.

315
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,686
How cute.

316
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:52,979
No, we are not.

317
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:54,226
I’m single.

318
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,135
I’m single and unattached.

319
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:55,137
I’m single and unattached.You are welcome to hit on me.

320
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:55,828
You are welcome to hit on me.

321
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:58,661
And that chef is my employee.

322
00:23:58,661 --> 00:23:59,903
Do you want my number?

323
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:01,321
Let’s get over there.

324
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,979
Did you just make brownies

325
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,978
or war in there?

326
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,978
Is it edible?

327
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,386
Then don’t eat.

328
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:30,762
Hold up. I haven’t had it yet.

329
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:36,979
Also, I’m curious about the taste of your baking.

330
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,508
I’m digging in now.

331
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:44,979
Krating!

332
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,979
Pob.

333
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,582
I can’t believe you’d hang up the gloves

334
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,979
and do this menial job instead.

335
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,978
You didn’t deserve to outclass me.

336
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,978
Stop. I’m the bodyguard of this café.

337
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,173
Show him what you’ve got.

338
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:11,390
Bodyguard?

339
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,979
Bodyguard, you say?

340
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,979
He was down in one punch.

341
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,005
Pob!

342
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,979
Krating!

343
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:26,979
Don’t come near me.

344
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,490
He’s getting up soon.

345
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,978
It’s not serious.

346
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,978
Why did you taser me?

347
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:02,806
Did you use it with the wrong person?

348
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:04,806
You should have tasered him.

349
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,894
You were closer.

350
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:13,978
And it was right to stop the cause of the problem.

351
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:15,670
He came to pick a bone with you.

352
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,963
But you got shocked and passed out.

353
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,978
He couldn’t start a fight.

354
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:20,978
She actually has a point.

355
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:22,978
You think?

356
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,480
Yes.

357
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,979
You are the problem.

358
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,544
So we should stop the problem.

359
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:36,979
Can you tell me now

360
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,979
why you threw a fist here?

361
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,875
What did he do to you?

362
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,979
Why are you so mad at him?

363
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,978
Krating, he…

364
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:00,979
he…

365
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,641
Why are you crying?

366
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:13,396
Yeah. Why are you crying?

367
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:15,769
Do you even need to ask why I cry?

368
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,978
If I knew, I wouldn’t ask.

369
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:23,978
That day...what you did to me…

370
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:25,978
How could you do this to me?

371
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:29,978
Did you do that to him and didn’t take responsibility?

372
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,489
Hold on.

373
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:34,662
It’s not that.

374
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,979
Pob, finish your sentence.

375
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,978
That day, you beat me with a knockout.

376
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,979
I was waiting to get a rematch but you suddenly quit.

377
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,979
So, it’s about boxing.

378
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:53,978
You are an asshole.

379
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:57,978
Wait. I cannot box with you anymore and you call me an asshole?

380
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:00,979
You and I

381
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,979
are both rising boxers who grow together.

382
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,049
We are all-time rivals that are meant to compete at the championship match.

383
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:27,978
1 2 3 4 5 6

384
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,979
You okay?

385
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,472
Fight!

386
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:50,509
1

387
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:51,756
2

388
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:52,979
3

389
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,635
4

390
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,650
That day, I might accidentally lose to you.

391
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,979
But I was pretty sure that I could beat you in the next bout.

392
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,978
But you suddenly quit.

393
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:16,587
Krating could not fight with you anymore.

394
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:18,979
Why, Coach?

395
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,979
He has quit boxing.

396
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:26,979
If he keeps boxing, he will die.

397
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,980
I have no chance to beat you again.

398
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:37,978
If not an asshole, then what should I call you?

399
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:41,482
I’m really disappointed in you.

400
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,978
You are just a waiter in this shabby café.

401
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:47,536
You should have been in the boxing ring fighting with me.

402
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,978
Right now, this is my place.

403
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:54,619
No matter what you say, I can never get back there and fight with you.

404
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,433
Even though you cannot fight with me,

405
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,979
you can still be in this field.

406
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:15,819
Listen, Krating.

407
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:15,820
Listen, Krating.The taste of your bakery is awful.

408
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,978
The taste of your bakery is awful.

409
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,979
I don’t think you can be a baker.

410
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,516
Hey, mister.

411
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,097
Are you a bully or a boxer?

412
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,586
Please calm down, Ms. Mone.

413
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,393
I can’t keep calm.

414
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,155
How could he spit out food like that?

415
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,888
Even dogs don’t do that.

416
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:41,241
Don’t you have manners?

417
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,898
Another thing is,

418
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,780
if you are so keen to fight each other,

419
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,979
there is another way that doesn't involve violence. What do you think?

420
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:53,683
What way?

421
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,978
Yeah. What is it?

422
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:59,609
If boxing cannot decide the winner between you.

423
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,365
You can fight in a baking challenge instead.

424
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:05,896
I suggest that you let Krating make brownies for you to try again.

425
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,979
If you don’t like it, it will mean the victory is yours.

426
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,979
If you like it, it will mean you are knocked out by Krating once again.

427
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:16,568
But you must be honest with your answer.

428
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,568
What do you think?

429
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,979
Pob won’t do it.

430
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,494
I didn’t say that.

431
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:27,978
I’m in.

432
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:31,523
Whatever I can compete with you, I’m in.

433
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:35,536
When will we do this?

434
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:38,979
Well then, come back here in the next 2 days.

435
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:42,979
What about you? Do you accept the challenge?

436
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,979
Definitely.

437
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:49,978
This time, I will knock you out with delicious taste.

438
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:52,979
We’ll see.

439
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,775
But I must warn you.

440
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,652
My tasting standard is much higher than you think.

441
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:00,563
We’ll see.

442
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,651
Your condo is actually far from the café.

443
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,978
When do you get up in the morning?

444
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:32,492
Come on.

445
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:35,978
How come you are sleeping?

446
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:46,979
Do whatever you want to do, Boss.

447
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:48,547
What?

448
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,670
This is the kind of moment

449
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,762
you lean to me and kiss.

450
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,979
If you don’t want to initiate it,

451
00:32:58,621 --> 00:32:59,576
I will.

452
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,978
Damn it. Get out of my car.

453
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,630
I won’t play along.

454
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:03,638
I won’t play along.Just a little tease. Why so serious?

455
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,978
Just a little tease. Why so serious?

456
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:07,978
Little, my ass.

457
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,550
Go now or else I kick you out.

458
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:13,978
Why are you so aggressive?

459
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:26,976
This dude.

460
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:30,175
He pretended to sleep to get a kiss?

461
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,890
He must have watched too many series.

462
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,569
[Krating Thatthep]

463
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,640
[Krating Thatthep quit boxing]

464
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,981
A fist fight?

465
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:07,978
Huh?

466
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,255
Gosh, Uncle. Keep it down.

467
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,840
You are hurting my ears.

468
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,226
I was away for only 1 day and you created a problem.

469
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,255
What were you thinking?

470
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,206
Why would you use my café for an absurd competition?

471
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:18,454
I don’t allow it.

472
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:20,978
Go tell your boxing partner.

473
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:22,639
Young Master.

474
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,425
I’m afraid that his opponent will not agree.

475
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:26,440
Report to the police, then.

476
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,442
Report to the police, then.Please, don’t.

477
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:27,659
Please, don’t.

478
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,724
Have some compassion for him.

479
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:30,853
How about this?

480
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:35,635
I will teach you how to make Cane Sugar Caramel and Cinnamon Brownies.

481
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:37,978
I assure you that you will not lose this challenge.

482
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,978
I don’t care if he will win or lose.

483
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,978
He must know that he cannot do anything at will like this.

484
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,978
Please have some empathy.

485
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,978
He’s pitiful.

486
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,467
Stop giving me that look.

487
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,509
I’m not gonna allow it.

488
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:01,978
Hey!

489
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,235
What are you doing?

490
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,235
Young Master! Watch out.

491
00:35:08,978 --> 00:35:10,483
You like to butt in?

492
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:14,978
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

493
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,585
Is this café crappy from the employer to employees?

494
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:19,978
What crap are you saying?

495
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,295
We are not crappy

496
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:22,581
You are not?

497
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,920
What kind of an employer are you?

498
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:23,927
What kind of an employer are you?Can’t you treat your people well? No wonder you have no customers.

499
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:27,048
Can’t you treat your people well? No wonder you have no customers.

500
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:29,496
How could you say that I didn’t treat my people well?

501
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,978
I’m the best boss in the world in terms of caring.

502
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,659
Best, my foot.

503
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,336
Did you realize that your employee didn’t have a shelter?

504
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,514
He has to sleep here every night.

505
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:43,978
Sleep here?

506
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:45,976
Oh-oh.

507
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,978
God damn it, Krating.

508
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:57,525
It hurts.

509
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,978
After I moved out of the boxing camp.

510
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,978
I don’t have a place to stay.

511
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,978
So I have been secretly crashing here.

512
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,978
Why didn’t you tell me?

513
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,902
Had I told you, you would not have let me stay, right?

514
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:21,688
What should I do?

515
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:23,688
I have no place to go.

516
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,626
Can you let me stay here until I find a new place to stay?

517
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:35,978
In the meantime, I’ll help guard the café at night.

518
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:39,586
You won’t get robbed.

519
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,521
Boss.

520
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,909
Please help him.

521
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,523
It’s really hard for him.

522
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,978
You are his boss.

523
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,978
Show some empathy to your people.

524
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:01,978
Young Master.

525
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,505
You are the kindest person I know.

526
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,516
Fine. You can stay here.

527
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,668
Because I’m a kind boss.

528
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:22,630
I let you stay.

529
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,978
Other people would kick you out instantly.

530
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:27,559
You are a godsend.

531
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:27,561
You are a godsend.But I don’t allow that challenge here.

532
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,978
But I don’t allow that challenge here.

533
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,507
It’s absurd.

534
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,978
You cannot speak of it like that.

535
00:37:38,753 --> 00:37:40,248
What’s wrong with you?

536
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:41,572
Boss.

537
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:44,978
In every competition, it takes determination.

538
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:47,978
The determination to fight

539
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:50,898
—either with themselves or their opponents—

540
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:53,978
Not just for the sake of fame or honor.

541
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:56,978
No competitions should be called absurd.

542
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,978
Especially when their dreams are at stake.

543
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:06,237
If I didn’t get to compete with Krating,

544
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:08,952
I wouldn’t have a will to compete with anyone else.

545
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:11,505
And my boxing career would end.

546
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,978
Don’t you feel sympathy for a man with dreams like me?

547
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,978
Yes, Young Master.

548
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,978
Please have sympathy for him.

549
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:34,505
Okay. You can do it.

550
00:38:39,898 --> 00:38:41,978
Thank you so much, Uncle.

551
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:44,978
Do your best, Krating.

552
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:56,418
Thank you so much for today.

553
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,458
I know that you are a great guy.

554
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,492
You gave me a lot of names earlier.

555
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,978
Please give it your all.

556
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,978
Sure.

557
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:25,978
Won’t it be too much for you?

558
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:29,217
You have to be prepared for the show

559
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,217
and train me.

560
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,978
I feel bad for bothering you.

561
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:35,123
Don’t worry.

562
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,340
I’m okay.

563
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,344
I’m okay.Teaching you doesn’t require a lot of effort.

564
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:38,978
Teaching you doesn’t require a lot of effort.

565
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,760
But traveling is.

566
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,978
My condo and this place are far from each other.

567
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:48,978
Thank you so much for helping me.

568
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:57,978
Here.

569
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,978
Before Krating came to work at Sweet Day café.

570
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,978
He used to be a rising star in boxing.

571
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:06,382
This man is called Pob.

572
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:08,510
He’s also a boxer and a rival of Krating.

573
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,489
I would like your Phueak Nae page

574
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:15,054
to feature this article of the last fight

575
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:17,514
between Krating and Pob.

576
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:22,860
And this time, it’s not just traditional news reporting.

577
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,498
I have a new idea that I would like to add.

578
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,570
What idea, dear?

579
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,978
Firstly, add dark chocolate, butter and cocoa powder.

580
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:43,978
Yes, Chef.

581
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,920
Now pour salt and vanilla extract in.

582
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,980
You haven’t added cinnamon.

583
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,978
Chef, if we…

584
00:42:22,884 --> 00:42:24,978
Please try it, Chef.

585
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:15,512
You may start.

586
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:18,804
Cane Sugar Caramel and Cinnamon Brownies

587
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,411
special recipe from Sweet Day café.

588
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:24,777
We used dark chocolate that is imported from Belgium.

589
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:26,204
We serve it with raspberry tea

590
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:29,978
as the tangy taste can counterbalance the full-flavored taste of brownies.

591
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:31,929
Enough babbling?

592
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:31,934
Enough babbling?I’m not babbling. You must learn what you are about to eat

593
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:34,844
I’m not babbling. You must learn what you are about to eat

594
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,976
to get the optimum taste of it.

595
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:37,690
Okay.

596
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,699
If you are done talking, shall we start the tasting session?

597
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:43,699
Yes. I’m ready.

598
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:46,978
We’ll see

599
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:50,978
you will be knocked out by me again or not.

600
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,978
How is it?

601
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:37,978
Boss.

602
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,978
Don’t worry. I’m well prepared today.

603
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:45,978
I’ll definitely pass this round.

604
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:47,978
I’m not worried about you.

605
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:50,976
I’m worried about those two at the café.

606
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:52,976
I wonder if it’s over.

607
00:44:56,545 --> 00:45:00,978
Competition is not always about winning or losing.

608
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:04,978
Friendship matters more.

609
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,978
It’s unbelievable.

610
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,978
How could I be this good at making this?

611
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:46,978
You are probably only good at this one.

612
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:50,480
I can bake you something else too.

613
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,978
No, thanks. I had too many sweets today.

614
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:57,978
Of course. You had 5 pieces of this.

615
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:04,514
To make sure that Pob wasn’t lying.

616
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:06,978
Pob?

617
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:10,385
Don’t you really know

618
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,978
that Pob didn’t intend to compete with you?

619
00:46:13,978 --> 00:46:16,978
What? A plot twist?

620
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:19,827
What do you mean?

621
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:23,978
Your rival, Pob, cares about you really much.

622
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:28,978
He just wants you to get on with your life.

623
00:46:31,036 --> 00:46:32,382
How would you know?

624
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:35,978
Yes, I know. I have interviewed everyone.

625
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:38,418
Coach Choke too.

626
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:40,418
You interviewed Coach Choke?

627
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,978
Yes.

628
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:43,393
What for?

629
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:45,978
I work for Phueak Nae page.

630
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:48,978
Phueak Nae…

631
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:51,978
That famous news page?

632
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:53,978
That’s right.

633
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:59,978
And now you are our next featured article.

634
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,409
I would like to record your interview.

635
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:06,978
But before that, I have something for you to see.

636
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,978
Krating.

637
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:24,978
Actually, I would like to talk to you face to face.

638
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:27,978
But I didn’t have the nerve to do so.

639
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,978
You are my all-time rival.

640
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:36,978
So I’ll tell you through this clip and ask Mone to show it to you.

641
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,978
Krating.

642
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:44,978
The day I found out that you could not box anymore,

643
00:47:47,204 --> 00:47:49,978
I was very upset.

644
00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:55,978
I didn’t understand why a talented boxer like you could not be a champion.

645
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:59,978
I felt very sorry for you.

646
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:04,978
Now that I know you have another dream.

647
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:08,978
It also makes me get up and fight again.

648
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,978
You are so strong.

649
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:13,978
You are really the best.

650
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,532
So,

651
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,978
you don’t need to worry.

652
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:23,509
I will bring the world championship belt to you.

653
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:25,509
As for you,

654
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,978
you must become a pastry chef no matter what.

655
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:30,978
You must do it.

656
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:32,978
You can do it!

657
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,978
That’s very touching.

658
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:43,666
Why are you so emotional?

659
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,978
It’s not that touching.

660
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:48,943
Really?

661
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:51,775
Why are your eyes red?

662
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:52,978
Wipe the tears.

663
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,626
What would you like to interview?

664
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:04,376
Your life.

665
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:07,978
Why does a boxer want to be a baker?

666
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,978
It’s a long story. I must warn you.

667
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,978
Okay,

668
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:21,978
I’m ready to dig out your life.

669
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:35,838
Hi. My name is Krating.

670
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:55,978
Weir.

671
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,980
Hey, Weir.

672
00:50:03,873 --> 00:50:05,492
We have arrived.

673
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,978
Boss, where are we?

674
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,496
Chef.

675
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:27,496
Krating.

676
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,978
Where are we, Boss?

677
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:35,543
My house.

678
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:36,978
What?

679
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,978
Why are you surprised, Pooh?

680
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:44,978
I forgot.

681
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,634
As one of you doesn’t have a place to live,

682
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,978
and another one lives too far from the café,

683
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:52,978
I let you two stay here.

684
00:50:54,456 --> 00:50:56,978
It’s an employee’s benefit from my café.

685
00:50:57,893 --> 00:50:59,170
Am I a good boss now?

686
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,887
Are you serious, Uncle?

687
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:02,137
Can I live here for free?

688
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:03,956
Yes.

689
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,463
My house is large.

690
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:06,492
I have rooms to spare.

691
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:07,594
Yes!!!

692
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:09,431
I have a home now.

693
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:13,980
I have prepared rooms for each of you.

694
00:51:14,597 --> 00:51:15,980
I have my own room, Uncle?

695
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,978
I have my own room too.

696
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:21,293
Wanna check it out?

697
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:23,293
Yes, please.

698
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,980
Well, Boss.

699
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:36,978
I didn’t bring my personal stuff with me.

700
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,978
If you mean a toothbrush, I have a new one for you.

701
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:43,978
I mean clothes.

702
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:46,978
Can I borrow yours?

703
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,978
Borrow from those two.

704
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:50,197
Don’t bother me.

705
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:52,813
But I want to wear your clothes.

706
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:54,536
No way.

707
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,896
Why are you so stingy? It’s just clothes.

708
00:51:57,896 --> 00:51:59,980
My clothes are expensive.

709
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:04,800
Well then, can I stay in your room?

710
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,416
Can I stay there too?

711
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:07,340
Leave my room alone.

712
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,342
Leave my room alone.Don’t start a fight.

713
00:52:07,342 --> 00:52:07,980
Don’t start a fight.

714
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:09,039
Where is your room?

715
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:09,739
Keep these guys away from me, Pooh.

716
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:11,576
Where’s the bathroom? I need to poo.

717
00:52:11,576 --> 00:52:13,576
That’s my room, Mr. Krating.

718
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:16,286
Don’t go in there, Mr. Krating.

719
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:23,978
What’s going on?

720
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:25,978
Why are there many people?

721
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:27,782
Are you Chef Weir?

722
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:30,478
Can I have your autograph? Please.

723
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:32,166
Chef Weir, may we interview you?

724
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:35,978
How do you feel about the unfair defeat on the Old Butter café?

725
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:40,373
The Old Butter café is owned by Nim.

726
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:42,309
She’s an elite girl in a group called Dok Jik.

727
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,311
She’s an elite girl in a group called Dok Jik.But I have a feeling that...

728
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:44,327
But I have a feeling that...

729
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,969
there’s something suspicious in this show, right?
