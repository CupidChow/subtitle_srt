Jean and I dated for five years.

27
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:52,783
He taught me the meaning and the heart of making desserts.

28
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,031
But in the end, it didn’t work out between us.

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,487
After we broke up, I quit my job and came back to Thailand.

30
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,855
So he came to see you because he wants you back?

31
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,168
I don’t know.

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,007
Maybe he just wanted to move back to Thailand.

33
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,656
Why did you guys break up?

34
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,650
I don’t want to talk about it.

35
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:23,040
We ended on bad terms.

36
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,730
Is this the burnt side of your life?

37
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:26,736
Is this the burnt side of your life?What burnt side? I’m confused.

38
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:28,671
What burnt side? I’m confused.

39
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,299
What burnt side?

40
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,191
You don’t have to know.

41
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:37,168
So, is he the one who broke your heart?

42
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:42,352
Yes.

43
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,870
He’s the most burnt side of my life.

44
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,439
Burnt to the point of bitter, actually.

45
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:54,207
He cruelly broke my heart.

46
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,608
What are you guys going to do next?

47
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:07,659
Are you asking me that because you’re jealous?

48
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:07,664
Are you asking me that because you’re jealous?Jealous, my ass.

49
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:08,864
Jealous, my ass.

Hey, Weir.

70
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:40,240
Don’t we have a cake to bake for our customer tomorrow?

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,623
We have to wake up at dawn to get started.

72
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,288
What cake?

73
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:45,807
I don’t remember we received such an order.

74
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:46,512
We did!

75
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,080
We received it just now. Can’t you remember?

76
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,080
Oh,

77
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,647
that cake.

78
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,409
Exactly.

79
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,909
You can’t go out tonight, Chef.

80
00:03:58,909 --> 00:03:58,912
You can’t go out tonight, Chef.Right, Uncle Bodyguard?

81
00:03:58,912 --> 00:03:59,639

82
00:03:59,639 --> 00:03:59,647
Right, Uncle Bodyguard?Really?

83
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:00,032
Really?

84
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,099
Yes.

85
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:01,104
Yes.Right, you can’t go out tonight.

86
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,704
Right, you can’t go out tonight.

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I’m not going to hurt Weir’s career.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Weir, it’s okay if we don’t stay out too late, right?

89
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:16,959
Fine.

90
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,639
Let’s go.

91
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:21,519

92
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:23,240

97
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:35,968
Why didn’t you stop him, Uncle?

98
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,824
Don’t you worry. I have a plan B.

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,591
What about the cake?

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,089
Your plan is to stalk him?

101
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:58,096
Your plan is to stalk him?Yes.

102
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes.

103
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:00,620
Did you really want to let him go on his own?

104
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,624
Did you really want to let him go on his own?Come on.

105
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:01,567

111
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:19,980

113

00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:42,576
Shit!

115
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,463

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,672

119
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:10,269
Weir,

120
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:14,752
do you remember your dream of opening your own dessert café?

121
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,720
Do you still want to do that?

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,728
Do you still want to do that?I do.

123
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:18,896
I do.

124
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:20,543
Why?

125
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,879
Would you be interested in becoming my partner?

126
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,872
You don’t have to worry about the cost and investment.

127
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,319
I’ll handle everything.

128
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,759
You can just take care of the café.

129
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,480
Can I think about it?

130
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,360
Alright.

131
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,759
Take your time.

132
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,336
When you’re ready, let me know.

133
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:52,831
Weir,

134
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,079
I came back because I want us back together.

135
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,264
Could you please give me a chance?

136
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,408
I promise

137
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,600
I will never hurt you again.

138
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,463
Please.

139
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:12,415
I promise.

140
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,410
Weir.

141
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,120
Boss.

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,127
Boss.Get inside.

143
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,151
Get inside.

144
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,889
Boss…

145
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:28,896
Boss…Pooh,

146
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:29,504
Pooh,

147
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:31,776
get him inside.

148
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:33,423
Come.

149
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:35,567
You too, Krating.

150
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,920
Kissing someone without consent

151
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,255
is sexual harassment.

152
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,831
Weir and I are together.

153
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:55,184
As far as I know, you’re just his ex.

154
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,800
As Weir’s boss,

155
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,959
I don’t want him to get involved with you again.

156
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:02,959
This should be fun.

157
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:16,959
Are you not feeling well, Chef?

158
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,935
I’m fine.

159
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,767
I just have something on my mind.

160
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,824
There’s something you all should know.

161
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:30,399
What is it?

162
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,200
Jean asked me to partner with him in opening a dessert café.

163
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,600
Does that mean you’ll leave Sweet Day?

164
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,360
Not yet.

165
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,087
I haven’t said yes.

166
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,648
I’m still working here as usual.

167
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,871
Hello, Jean.

168
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,032
What?

169
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,248
You’re coming to try Sweet Day’s desserts?

170
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:11,456
Okay.

171
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,879
Pretty good.

172
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,350
But I think it’d be better if you add a little more milk

173
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,351
But I think it’d be better if you add a little more milkand make the texture more moist.

174
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,727
and make the texture more moist.

175
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay, I’ll try that next time.

176
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,864
By the way,

177
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,087
don’t you have clafoutis here?

178
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:41,080
No, I haven’t made them.

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,879
Why not?

180
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,655
You make good clafoutis.

181
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:50,220
A lot of customers asked for them after you left us, you know?

182
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,224
A lot of customers asked for them after you left us, you know?Really?

183
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:50,879
Really?

184
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,600
Yes.

185
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:55,327
Here.

186
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,392
I made you some canelés.

187
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,631
I know you love them.

188
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,888
Thank you.

189
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,039
Still as yummy as ever.

190
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:30,687
Young Master,

191
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,855
if Weir leaves us to be with Jean,

192
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,663
what will we do?

193
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:38,720
What? Weir is leaving?

194
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,792
Yeah, he might leave to be with that man.

195
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:46,039
If he does, you won’t get to eat yummy desserts anymore.

196
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,048
If he does, you won’t get to eat yummy desserts anymore.No, I won’t let that happen.

197
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,320
No, I won’t let that happen.

198
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,816
I won’t let anyone take Weir away.

199
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,648
Weir hasn’t given him an answer.

200
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,903
He might not leave.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,039
If I were him,

202
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,048
If I were him,I would leave without a second thought.

203
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,440
I would leave without a second thought.

204
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:00,672
Excuse me?

205
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,864
What’s so bad about staying with me?

206
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:06,159
He offered to make him his partner, not his employee.

207
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,672
Who wouldn’t want to take a good offer like that?

208
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,816
Maybe a good name is all he has.

209
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,224
Who knows if he really makes good desserts?

210
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:23,967
Have a bite.

211
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,960
This is really good.

212
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,480
I love it.

213
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,008
It’s so-so.

214
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,008
We’re planning to sell canelés on New Year’s.

215
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:55,179
I’ll wait and see if they’re really as good as you say.

216
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:55,183
I’ll wait and see if they’re really as good as you say.Be my guest.

217
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:56,000
Be my guest.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,210
How could Boss challenge him like that?

219
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,216
How could Boss challenge him like that?Let me tell you that my mentor’s canelés are the best I’ve ever had anywhere.

220
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:10,303
Let me tell you that my mentor’s canelés are the best I’ve ever had anywhere.

221
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:14,511
Are you saying you can’t make better ones?

222
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:16,509
Don’t forget that he’s my mentor.

223
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,927
I learned my techniques from him.

224
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:27,759
But I think if we team up, we might be able to make better ones than he does.

225
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,120
We can try.

226
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,128
I have to explain this first, Krating.

227
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:37,152
Even though you don’t need many ingredients for canelés,

228
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,149
they’re still complicated to make,

229
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,248
both at the flour mixing step

230
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,528
and the baking step.

231
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:53,168
It’s one of the hardest desserts to bake right.

232
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:00,320
Now we wait.

233
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,279
TWO DAYS LATER

234
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,440
Here’s the rum

235
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm going to add.

236
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:17,903
Meanwhile,

237
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,032
you can butter the mold.

238
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,447
Look, Krating. You’ll hear this sound when you squeeze it.

239
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,440
Try it.

240
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,552
It’s pretty good, Chef,

241
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:15,100
but…

242
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,104
but…But not as good as Jean’s.

243
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,751
But not as good as Jean’s.

244
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,792
I think we need to think of something different.

245
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,703
What if we make these in chocolate flavor and add some fillings?

246
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,080
I think that’s interesting.

247
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:38,655
But what kind of fillings should we add?

248
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:47,929
What should we make today, Chef?

249
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:47,936
What should we make today, Chef?Croissants, according to our schedule.

250
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,000
Croissants, according to our schedule.

251
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:51,344
Weir.

252
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,192
Hey, don’t you get tired of seeing our faces every day?

253
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,909
I’m so sick of your face already.

254
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:00,912
I’m so sick of your face already.I’m afraid you’ll have to put up with me for a long time

255
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,368
I’m afraid you’ll have to put up with me for a long time

256
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,379
because from now on, I’ll be Weir’s chauffeur.

257
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:06,384
because from now on, I’ll be Weir’s chauffeur.I don’t think Weir wants to hang out with his ex every day.

258
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:09,360
I don’t think Weir wants to hang out with his ex every day.

259
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,104
That would be too uncomfortable.

260
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:11,888
Exactly.

261
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,296
Having me drive him around is enough.

262
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:21,552
Weir, is it true you don’t want me to drive you?

263
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:24,991
I don’t…

264
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:25,648
Please?

265
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,104
Alright.

266
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,679
See?

267
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,015
Weir wants me to drive him.

268
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,009
Please come with me, Weir.

269
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,000
What happened to the Gay Conquerer?

270
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:57,289
If I’m the Gay Conquerer,

271
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:01,087
Jean is the Guy Conquerer.

272
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,080
The Guy Conquerer?

273
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,830
Jean is very charming.

274
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:06,831
Jean is very charming.Whoever gets to make eye contact with him loses to him.

275
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:10,080
Whoever gets to make eye contact with him loses to him.

276
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,080
I thought I was strong but I still lost to him.

277
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,072
I don’t believe that.

278
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,379
I won’t lose to him.

279
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:18,384
I won’t lose to him.I don’t believe your words.

280
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:26,032
I don’t believe your words.

281
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,679
I will never fall for him either.

282
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:28,687
I will never fall for him either.If you keep trying Jean’s desserts, you might fall in love with him.

283
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:34,000
If you keep trying Jean’s desserts, you might fall in love with him.

284
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,943
Bring it on.

285
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:37,855
I want to see how good he is.

286
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,272
Pooh, you’ll be the first to serve him.

287
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:53,744
Really?

288
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,432
This is our honey cream cheese coconut cupcake.

289
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:13,488
Merci.

290
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,743
May I have some tissue papers?

291
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:33,230
How’s it going?

292
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,231
How’s it going?Young Master, he’s very charming.

293
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:36,544
Young Master, he’s very charming.

294
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,079
I caught a glimpse of his eyes and I don’t know what’s happening.

295
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,670
My heart is beating so fast.

296
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:44,672
My heart is beating so fast.Your heart is on another side.

297
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:45,584
Your heart is on another side.

298
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,390
It’s shaking. I don’t know what’s happening, Young Master.

299
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,392
It’s shaking. I don’t know what’s happening, Young Master.You’re useless, Pooh Bear.

300
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,951
You’re useless, Pooh Bear.

301
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:54,928
Come on, let me handle it.

302
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,407
Your tissue papers.

303
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,079
Merci.

304
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:15,023
What are you looking at?

305
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,864
No, I just want to see a mixed-race person’s eyes.

306
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,279
Want to have a bite?

307
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,509
Yes.

308
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:36,511
Yes.Krating!

309
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,567
Krating!

310
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:47,279
This is heavenly.

311
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,480
I can die right now with no regrets.

312
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,152
Help yourself

313
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,776
Please adopt me.

314
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,592
I want to eat your desserts every day.

315
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,288
How delicious can it be?

316
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,736
It’s not delicious.

317
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:25,536
Everyone thinks it’s delicious, only you don’t.

318
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,150
Could you please explain why?

319
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:32,576
What’s missing?

320
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:36,029
Bad desserts are just bad desserts.

321
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,976
There’s no need to find a reason why.

322
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:42,703
Can’t you accept my honest criticism?

323
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,688
A professional like me can take criticism

324
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,175
as long as you tell me what’s lacking.

325
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:57,584
Be specific so I can improve next time.

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,991
Don’t tell me you don’t even know the ingredients of these simple cookies?

327
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,250
Are you really the owner of this café?

328
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,256
Are you really the owner of this café?Hey.

329
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:14,750
Hey.

330
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:14,751
Hey.A talented person like Weir shouldn’t be wasting his time with you.

331
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:18,991
A talented person like Weir shouldn’t be wasting his time with you.

332
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,119
He deserves to be with someone more professional.

333
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,127
He deserves to be with someone more professional.How about we make a deal?

334
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,152
How about we make a deal?

335
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,776
If I can memorize the names and ingredients of every French pastry,

336
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:32,192
you’ll leave Weir alone and never show your face here again.

337
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,539
Okay.

338
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:34,544
Okay.Deal.

339
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:35,423
Deal.

340
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:43,819
But if you lose, you’ll let Weir leave your café to be with me.

341
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,839
How much time will you give me?

342
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:44,847
How much time will you give me?For someone like you, one month.

343
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:49,000
For someone like you, one month.

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,008
For someone like you, one month.One week.

345
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:49,759
One week.

346
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:50,816
Boss.

347
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:54,720
Okay.

348
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,809
Weir.

349
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,344
I have a favor to ask.

350
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:12,976
What is it, Boss?

351
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:16,624
I want to beat Jean.

352
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,799
I have to become better than him.

353
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,140
Can you teach me?

354
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,144
Can you teach me?If you want me to, tonight is going to be a tough night for you.

355
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:23,807
If you want me to, tonight is going to be a tough night for you.

356
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,895
You may not get to sleep.

357
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,592
Okay.

358
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,016
Skipping a night of sleep won’t kill me.

359
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,240
Then come with me quickly.

360
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:31,183
Wait.

361
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:32,440
Where are we going?

362
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,448
Where are we going?My room, of course.

363
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:33,503
My room, of course.

364
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,231
You said you wanted me to teach you.

365
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,759
I want you to teach me about desserts.

366
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:38,768
I want you to teach me about desserts.I’m just kidding.

367
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:40,112
I’m just kidding.

368
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,824
You’ll have to do your best to memorize though.

369
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,087
There are a lot of details about French pastries.

370
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:50,816
Alright.

371
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,839
What’s the most important and unique ingredient for a financier?

372
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:56,890
Rum?

373
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:56,895
Rum?That’s for a canelé.

374
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:57,839
That’s for a canelé.

375
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,208
The answer is almond flour.

376
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,339
Palmier?

377
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:03,344
Palmier?The English name is butterfly pie.

378
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,819
The English name is butterfly pie.

379
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:05,824
The English name is butterfly pie.Chocolate madeleine.

380
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,019
Chocolate madeleine.

381
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:07,023
Chocolate madeleine.Memorize it.

382
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:08,089
Memorize it.

383
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:08,096
Memorize it.Yes, sir.

384
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:08,720
Yes, sir.

385
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:12,960
What’s the first step?

386
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,816
Whisk chicken eggs, sugar

387
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:15,720
and salt.

388
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:15,728
and salt.What’s this?

389
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:16,463
What’s this?

390
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,567
Mille-feuille.

391
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,784
Soufflé

392
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:19,690
Éclair.

393
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:19,695
Éclair.Butterfly pie.

394
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,359
Butterfly pie.

395
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:49,049
What are you doing with Chef, Uncle?

396
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:49,056
What are you doing with Chef, Uncle?Last night did you…?

397
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:49,960
Last night did you…?

398
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:49,968
Last night did you…?It’s not what you think.

399
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,167
It’s not what you think.

400
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,329
Weir, what did you do to me last night?

401
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:54,336
Weir, what did you do to me last night?Boss, do you really not remember what you did last night?

402
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:58,496
Boss, do you really not remember what you did last night?

403
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:00,976
Remember what? What did I do to you?

404
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,912
Last night you felt hot and were sweating all over.

405
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:10,784
I waved my hands to cool you down but I couldn’t do it all night

406
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,511
so I unbuttoned your shirt a bit.

407
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,632
Why didn’t you turn on the AC instead of unbuttoning my shirt?

408
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,016
Hi, what can I get for you?

409
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,140
Which ones of your desserts don’t contain nuts? My girlfriend is allergic.

410
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,144
Which ones of your desserts don’t contain nuts? My girlfriend is allergic.We have quite a few options.

411
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,016
We have quite a few options.

412
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,490
We have lemon tarts, apple tarts, chocolate cakes,

413
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:36,496
We have lemon tarts, apple tarts, chocolate cakes,crepe cakes, cheesecakes, crème brulées and éclairs.

414
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:39,480
crepe cakes, cheesecakes, crème brulées and éclairs.

415
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:39,488
crepe cakes, cheesecakes, crème brulées and éclairs.Any éclair works except caramel éclairs because those contain hazelnuts.

416
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:43,839
Any éclair works except caramel éclairs because those contain hazelnuts.

417
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:45,289
Oh, okay.

418
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:45,296
Oh, okay.What are those?

419
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,511
What are those?

420
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:50,048
Oh, these are financiers.

421
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,839
She can eat them.

422
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,344
Okay, I’ll take some of those then.

423
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,730
How many pieces would you like?

424
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:56,736
How many pieces would you like?Four would be great.

425
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,175
Four would be great.

426
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,183
You got it.

427
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:12,250
Here you are.

428
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,256
Here you are.What are you doing?

429
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you doing?

430
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,344
I should be the one asking you that.

431
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,288
Don’t you know that financiers contain almonds?

432
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,430
Sorry, I got it wrong.

433
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:22,432
Sorry, I got it wrong.You can’t even get your simple facts right?

434
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:25,039
You can’t even get your simple facts right?

435
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,130
If he hadn’t warned you and my girlfriend ate them, she would die.

436
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,135
If he hadn’t warned you and my girlfriend ate them, she would die.Unbelievable.

437
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,144
Unbelievable.

438
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,160
Making desserts is not only a chef’s responsibility.

439
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:41,263
A cafe owner must also understand and learn about it.

440
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:46,880
This is another proof that you don’t deserve to work with Weir.

441
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,695
Tonight I have to memorize the ingredients of every French pastry.

442
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,496
I will be the most handsome and perfect owner.

443
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,807
You and Pooh have to tutor me.

444
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,912
Wait a minute.

445
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,311
All of these?

446
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,160
Yes.

447
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:31,872
I will show Weir I’m a better owner than Jean

448
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,039
so he’ll stay with us.

449
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,048
so he’ll stay with us.Then let’s tutor you up.

450
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:35,359
Then let’s tutor you up.

451
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:53,680
Help me.

452
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,160
Help me.

453
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:57,968
Fat cream,

454
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:01,327
milk, natural ground coffee,

455
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:03,369
sugar.

456
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:03,375
sugar.Correct.

457
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,544
Correct.

458
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,049
Are you ready, Young Master?

459
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:07,056
Are you ready, Young Master?Yes.

460
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:07,503
Yes.

461
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,119
Go.

462
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,887
Macaron.

463
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:11,369
Egg whites,

464
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:11,375
Egg whites,icing sugar,

465
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,592
icing sugar,

466
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:14,127
almond powder,

467
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:16,000
salt.

468
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,960
Yes!

469
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:17,759
Crème brûlée.

470
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,680
Egg yolks,

471
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:18,688
Egg yolks,sugar, milk, salt,

472
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:21,071
sugar, milk, salt,

473
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,847
heavy cream.

474
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,248
What else?

475
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Vanilla.

476
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,819
Correct!

477
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:27,824
Correct!Yay!

478
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:29,087
Yay!

479
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,048
Go!

480
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:40,240
Do I really have to try these?

481
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,135
If you don’t, how will you be able to tell the difference?

482
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:47,039
Different kinds of sugar taste different.

483
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,039
Fine.

484
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:11,887
Young Master!

485
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,511
Are you alright, Uncle?

486
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:32,319
Is Chef not picking up?

487
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,279
Why isn’t he back yet?

488
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,584
How can we get our canelés ready for sale on New Years’?

489
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,976
Mr. Weir has probably arrived.

490
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:46,079
Baby Pig?

491
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,960
Piglet.

492
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:50,463
Can I crash here tonight?

493
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:51,819
Have you told your mother?

494
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:51,824
Have you told your mother?I already got her permission.

495
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:54,319
I already got her permission.

496
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,008
I want to help you make canelés.

497
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,327
Can you give Pooh Bear a hug?

498
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,880
I think you have to make them yourself, Krating.

499
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:05,968
What?

500
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,064
Are you sure?

501
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,223
Canelés are difficult to make.

502
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,071
We can’t rely on Weir alone.

503
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:14,720
We must rely on ourselves for a change.

504
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:18,112
Otherwise, we won’t be able to keep Weir.

505
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,407
If we help each other, we can do it.

506
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,064
What’s this?

507
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,832
Oh, it’s a cinnamon stick.

508
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,960
It makes the flavor more sophisticated and matches well with the flavor of the orange juice.

509
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,663
Wow, you’re so good, Krating.

510
00:28:44,144 --> 00:28:44,624
Amazing.

511
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:48,864
Let’s get started.

512
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:18,809
How is it?

513
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:18,816
How is it?Quite good.

514
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:19,776
Quite good.

515
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,384
But it can be better.

516
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,359
I have something that can help.

517
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:33,359
[Guaranteed to be yummy]

518
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,511
It will be yummy.

519
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,869
The fact that the murderer committed another crime

520
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:53,872
The fact that the murderer committed another crimeafter almost 21 years

521
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:56,288
after almost 21 years

522
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,432
means there must be some kind of motive.

523
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,440
That’s possible.

524
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,920
Or it could be a copycat crime.

525
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,928
A copycat killer?

526
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:07,440
That’s very interesting.

527
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,592
Speaking of twenty-one years ago,

528
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,991
do you remember who the suspects were at the time?

529
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:24,240
The police suspected a lot of people

530
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,960
but there was no evidence that could link them to the crime, right?

531
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:29,968
but there was no evidence that could link them to the crime, right?Yeah, there was nothing.

532
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:30,920
Yeah, there was nothing.

533
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:30,928
Yeah, there was nothing.No.

534
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:31,839
No.

535
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,655
I think I forgot some folders upstairs.

536
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,000
I’ll be right back.

537
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:07,135
Do you think the murderer could be who we think it is?

538
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,751
I secretly wondered about that.

539
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,839
Their method is very similar.

540
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,432
Yes.

541
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:15,632
It’s just like what happened twenty-one years ago.

542
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,031
I’m so scared.

543
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,104
Hey.

544
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,223
I’m scared we’re the reason all the kids are dead.

545
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,544
Mone,

546
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:41,327
have you seen the news about a thug who attacked a doctor who treated his enemy?

547
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,968
Yes, why?

548
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:48,271
Your mother and I want you to cover that news.

549
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,784
We’ll cover the case of the kidnapped kid ourselves.

550
00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:57,903
Oh? But I’ve been investigating this case since the beginning.

551
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,190
Why are you making me cover another case?

552
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,192
Why are you making me cover another case?Because you’re better at fieldwork than we are

553
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:03,488
Because you’re better at fieldwork than we are

554
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:06,859
and that case requires speed.

555
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:06,864
and that case requires speed.If we’re slow, the news could die down.

556
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:10,624
If we’re slow, the news could die down.

557
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:14,208
Fine,

558
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:18,319
but let me go with you to talk to Punn.

559
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:21,632
I have something to ask him myself.

560
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,839
I have something to ask him myself.

561
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:37,839
I have something to ask him myself.

562
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,976
Made without the help of a top chef like Weir.

563
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,567
We want to give you the honor

564
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,104
of being the first to try it.

565
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,488
Good appearance.

566
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,259
Good color.

567
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:07,263
Good color.Crispy on the outside.

568
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:08,624
Crispy on the outside.

569
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
Soft and chewy on the inside.

570
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:15,039
What I love most is the orange cinnamon filling

571
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,240
because it goes very well with the flour.

572
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:23,200
As a chef, I have to say you make a very yummy

573
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
and unique dessert.

574
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:28,640
I wouldn’t be able to copy it if I tried.

575
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,759
I finally made a yummy dessert.

576
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:38,895
You’re amazing.

577
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:45,968
What about our competition, Mr. Owner?

578
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:47,104
I’m ready.

579
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:52,912
If you lose, don’t forget to keep your promise.

580
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:57,039
You have to keep your promise as well.

581
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:58,624
Of course.

582
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:00,192
No problem.

583
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,420
I’m going to ask you three questions today.

584
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,423
I’m going to ask you three questions today.You have to tell me the correct ingredients for each.

585
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:07,584
You have to tell me the correct ingredients for each.

586
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,300
Please do.

587
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,304
Please do.First question.

588
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,231
First question.

589
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,840
Cherry clafoutis.

590
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:14,831
All purpose flour,

591
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,829
sugar, milk, salt,

592
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,829
vanilla extract, egg whites, egg yolks,

593
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:20,128
butter and cherries.

594
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:23,184
Finally, icing on top after baking.

595
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,135
I saw you make that dessert all the time.

596
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,159
Did I get it right?

597
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:27,327
Yes.

598
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:31,711
Second question.

599
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:33,710
Dacquoise.

600
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,384
Meringue cake with filling.

601
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:39,807
The main ingredients would be almond powder and hazelnut.

602
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,639
Sugar, salt and egg whites to make meringue.

603
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:46,219
Chocolate ganache that is dark chocolate mixed with whipping cream

604
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:46,224
Chocolate ganache that is dark chocolate mixed with whipping creamand unsalted butter.

605
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:47,184
and unsalted butter.

606
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:51,070
The cream can be whipping cream or butter cream.

607
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,072
The cream can be whipping cream or butter cream.Egg yolks, milk, corn powder, and coffee extract.

608
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:55,311
Egg yolks, milk, corn powder, and coffee extract.

609
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,431
Okay.

610
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,199
Ask me your last question.

611
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:04,447
Don’t hold back.

612
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:07,119
Last one.

613
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:14,440
Île flottante.

614
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,248
Would you like to give up?

615
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:28,943
Never.

616
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,340
Sugar, eggs.

617
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:33,344
Sugar, eggs.Egg yolks or egg whites?

618
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,384
Egg yolks or egg whites?

619
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,800
Both.	And salt.

620
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,552
What else?

621
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:43,824
Vanilla.

622
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,576
Still missing the main ingredient.

623
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,384
Wheat flour.

624
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:51,391
Wrong.

625
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,903
It looks like you’ve lost, Mr. Owner.

626
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,103
The correct answer is milk

627
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,112
because no wheat flour is needed in any step of making an Île flottante.

628
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,327
It’s a light meringue

629
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:09,887
floating on vanilla cream sauce.

630
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,168
Like an island floating on the sea.

631
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:13,983
Wait.

632
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:16,271
That’s oeufs à la neige.

633
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:22,989
You don’t know that oeufs à la neige and îles flottantes are the same thing?

634
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:22,992
You don’t know that oeufs à la neige and îles flottantes are the same thing?That’s not fair.

635
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:24,288
That’s not fair.

636
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,032
Why didn’t you give him both names?

637
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,344
How is it not fair?

638
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,039
It’s Mr. Owner’s fault that he didn’t know its other name.

639
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,760
How am I wrong?

640
00:36:32,447 --> 00:36:35,456
I’ll take Weir as a prize.

641
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,449
I lost.

642
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,768
You can do whatever you decide.

643
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:47,440
Boss.

644
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,760
Allow me to take Weir.

645
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,655
Come, darling.

646
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:15,179
Come, darling.

647
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:15,184
Come, darling.Thank you.

648
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:16,463
Thank you.

649
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,648
Good evening.

650
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:33,639
What can I get for you?

651
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,175
We’re not here for desserts.

652
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:42,920
We’re here to ask you a few questions.

653
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:42,927
We’re here to ask you a few questions.What’s this about?

654
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,659
What’s this about?

655
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:43,664
What’s this about?You heard about the kid who got kidnapped and killed, right?

656
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:49,487
You heard about the kid who got kidnapped and killed, right?

657
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:53,456
Recently, another kid was kidnapped.

658
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:56,016
Luckily, that kid survived.

659
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,103
We’re trying to catch the murderer.

660
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,335
Why are you asking me about this?

661
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:06,927
I looked up the news from twenty years ago.

662
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,447
One boy made it out alive then as well.

663
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,559
You’re that boy.

664
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,496
Can you remember what your kidnapper looked like?

665
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,552
Mone,

666
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:23,880
please leave us for now.

667
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:23,887
please leave us for now.But…

668
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:24,400
But…

669
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,280
And please don’t talk about this in front of Young Master again.

670
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:29,280
I beg you.

671
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:39,775
You don’t look very happy.

672
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:41,503
Is something wrong?

673
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:45,760
I have something on my mind.

674
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:49,007
I did what I did because I meant well.

675
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,407
I want you to be with the right café

676
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,248
and experience good things.

677
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,920
I don’t know which place is right for me

678
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,391
but I feel that everyone at Sweet Day is special.

679
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,992
And what do you think of the owner?

680
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,704
On the outside,

681
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,327
he seems very unreliable, doesn’t he?

682
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,128
That’s right.

683
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,592
Actually, he’s a very good boss.

684
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:25,231
No matter what trouble anyone is in, he’s willing to do his best to help.

685
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,255
He’s the person I trust the most.

686
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,920
Do you trust me at all?

687
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,952
Jean.

688
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,271
Can we go back to how we were?

689
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:04,655
Please give me another chance, mon amour.

690
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:06,650
Please?

691
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,039
Please?

692
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,255
Merci, mon amour.

693
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,250
Weir.

694
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:39,632
Are you sleeping?

695
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:40,768
Not yet.

696
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:41,952
Can I come in?

697
00:40:54,608 --> 00:40:55,949
Is everything alright, Boss?

698
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:57,949
What’s going on between you and Jean?

699
00:40:59,295 --> 00:40:59,949
Boss.

700
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,639
Are you leaving us to be with Jean?

701
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,010
Boss, um,...

702
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,016
Boss, um,...If I sleep with you,

703
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:09,023
If I sleep with you,

704
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:11,072
will you stay?

705
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:22,559
