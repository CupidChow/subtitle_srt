You want to fight, Uncle?

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,109
Give me some respect. I’m the owner of the café.

43
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,060
I’ve already given you my hatred.

44
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,500
You’re misunderstanding something.

Calm down.	That’s enough.

Can I try it now?

00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:34,719
Of course.

00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,469
Not bad.

Keep practicing and developing your skills.

You, too, Uncle Bodyguard.

Yes.

Why don’t you ask me in French?

56
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,489
Oh, you don’t even understand Thai.

57
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,099
Krating, that’s not nice.

58
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,670
Sorry.

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,080
Would you do me the honor of trying my food, Uncle?

60
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,629
Fine, I’m doing you the honor.

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,969
Hey, this is good, Ting Nong Noy.

62

Wow, this is even better than Jean’s pasta.

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Speaking of Jean,

we haven’t seen him a lot lately.

He doesn’t come to make us breakfast anymore.

Jean has been busy with opening his new café.

68
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,409
but if you guys miss him, I can call him over.

69

There’s no need.

70
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,310
I’m sick of his face.

71
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,669
Oh, I made these Thai tea almond cookies.

72
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,060
Please have some.

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
Wow, this is so good, Mr. Weir.

74
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,139
It tastes just right, Chef.

75
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,099
Really?

76
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,889
But I think something is missing.

77
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,060
Will you try these, Boss?

78
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,629
No.	I don’t eat sweets.

79
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,969
You could’ve just told me you wanted to eat my spaghetti.

80
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:19,639
Yes,

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
I really want to eat your spaghetti

82
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,240
because it’s not often that your food turns out tasty.

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,039
Then eat up.

84
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,090

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,360

Mone est si belle.

It means Monet is very beautiful.

109
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,670
Repeat after me.

110
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,560
Mone n’est pas belle. (Mone is not beautiful.)

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,740
Mone est si belle.

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,230

Uncle, what are you doing?

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,350
A customer dropped her contact lens.

116
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,290
Forget it.	I can’t wear it anymore anyway.

117
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,160
No.

118
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,600

Wow, cuteness must be in their genes.

132

Both the brother and the sister are cute.

133
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,240
You should focus on teaching me.

134
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,240
And you should focus on your study.

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,540
How are you, View?

136
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,470
Is everything alright with you?

137
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,209
Yeah, I have so much to talk with you about.

138
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,470
Oh, you still have that phobia?

139

How do you find working here?

140
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,209
Is it better than France?

141
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,740
It is.

142
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,009
I feel so much more comfortable here.

143
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,839
And how have you been?

144
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,870
I have good news to share.

145
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,399
What is it?

146
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,850
I’m getting married, Weir.

147
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,529
View,

148
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,939
I’m so happy for you.

149
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,389
Weir.

150
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,040
You’ll come to my wedding, right?

151
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:14,959
I…

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,759
Mom wants to see you.

153
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,740
Weir,

154
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,160
how much longer are you going to avoid talking to her?

155
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,730
Weir,

156
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,639
why didn’t you tell me you have a beautiful sister?

157
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,639
You never asked.

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,399
Is she seeing someone?

159
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,220
Introduce me.

160
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,279
She just told me she’s getting married.

161
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,939
Boss, can I take a day off today?

162
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,160
Are you sick?

163
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,569
No, I’m fine.

164
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,689
I’m just tired. I want to get some rest.

165
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,319
Sure,

166
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,029
go get some rest.

167
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,839
Thank you.

168
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I’m going then.

169
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
He must have something on his mind

170
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,730
but just doesn’t want to tell us yet.

171
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,059
Tert,

172
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,759
it’s time to eat.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,460
Tert.

174
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:14,169
Tert.

175
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,690
Tert.

176
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,509
Easy, honey.

177
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,840
You don’t want to get drunk.

178
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,009
I do.

179
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,279
I have it ready.

180
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:50,799
Aod.

181
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,700
You know me best.

182
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,200
I only know about your drinking.

183
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,399
I’ll leave the other things to your boyfriend.

184
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,129
Oh,

185
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,039
he’s leaving up to his name the Guy Conquerer.

186
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,639
You’re flirting around again.

187
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,639
It’s normal for the…

188
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,440
The Guy Conquerer.

189
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,039
Stop with that excuse.

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,620
Relax.

191
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,169
You’re no fun when you’re like this.

192
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,610
I’m sorry.

193
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,200
Something happened today.

194
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,759
My sister came to the café and told me she’s getting married.

195
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,759
Isn’t that a good thing?

196
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,080
Do you have somewhere to be?

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,340
No.

198
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,960
Let’s dance.

199
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,200
We’re at a pub. We should have fun.

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,679
That’s enough, honey.

201
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,500
Are you that stressed out about your sister getting married?

202
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,879
It’s not about my sister.

203
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,480
You never remember why I ran away to France, do you?

204
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,379
Let’s talk nicely. Don’t yell.

205
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,889
You’re acting like a child.

206
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,320
I’m acting like a child?

207
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,470
If being an adult means being like you and not caring about others,

208
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,950
I don’t want to be one.

209
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,950
Let’s talk later.

210
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,120
Are you really leaving in the middle of the fight?

211
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,659
Don’t be silly, honey.

212
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,649
Don’t go.

213
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,350
I have to go take care of something.

214
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,570
I’ll see you tomorrow.

215
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:56,639
Aod.

216
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,080
Why did you all follow me?

217
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,620
I’m fine on my own.

218
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,320
Obviously, we’re worried about Chef.

219
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,139
Young Master, I’ll carry Mr. Weir.

220
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,149
We have to find him first.

221
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,940
Young Master!

222
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,080
There he is!

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,539
Come on.

224
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:49,289
He’s so stubborn. I tried to stop him but he wouldn’t listen or come down.

225
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,250
Get him down.

226
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,039
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Careful.

228
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,120
Mr. Weir.

229
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,840
Where are we going?

230
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,049
How much did you drink?

231
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,559
As much as my heart wanted.

232
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,440
Stop being witty.

233
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,100
Come on, let’s go home.

234
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,779
Not yet.

235
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,909
I’m still okay.

236
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,759
How can you say you’re okay when you’re so wasted? You’re not okay, Chef.

237
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,990
I’m your mentor, Ting Nong Noy.

238
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:36,679
Chef.

239
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,320
I’m sorry, everyone,

240
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,039
for troubling you.

241
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,870
It’s alright.

242
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,809
What’s going on with you today?

243
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,139
Is it about your sister’s visit?

244
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,009
It’s not that.

245
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:10,799
I just…

246
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,070
I just don’t want to see my mom.

247
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,500
Why not?

248
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,639
My mom is the reason I’m scared of women.

249
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,600
How did it happen?

250
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,879
What did your mom do?

251
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,600
She stole my first love.

252
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,779
Teacher Noom was my first love.

253
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,399
What are you daydreaming about?

254
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,960
Your exam is getting closer.

255
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,600
I’m sorry.

256
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,039
Pay attention.

257
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,980
I don’t want your mother to think I’m a bad teacher.

258
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,389
Got it?

259
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,919
Hey, guys.

261
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,159
I brought you something to boost your energy.

262
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,200
Thai tea almond cookies.

263
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,440
Yes, your favorite.

264
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:08,720
Have some, Teacher.

265
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,669
My mother makes the best Thai tea almond cookies in the world.

266
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,360
Can I try one of these then?

267
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,789
Of course.

268
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,039
You’re right. This is so good.

269
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,639
See? I told you.

270
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,500
So good.

271
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,139
I’m back, Mom.

272
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,600
The school let us go early.

273
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,960
What food do we have today?

274
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,289
Teacher Noom.

275
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:40,509
Weir!

276
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,899
Weir!

277
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,850
Weir!

278
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:58,600
The memory of Mom trying to beg her own son not to tell Dad about her sin

279
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,170
is too much for me to bear.

280
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,359
Weir.

281
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,779
Please don’t tell your dad.

282
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,890
I just made a mistake.

283
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,369
It’s not a big deal.

284
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,869
How could you say that?

285
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,960
You’re having an affair with my teacher.

286
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,200
I beg you.

287
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,369
Why him?

288
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,319
Why Teacher Noom?

289
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,279
Don’t you love Dad anymore?

290
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,180
Sometimes adult relationships are complicated.

291
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,519
I beg you, Weir.

292
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,230
I promise I won’t do anything like this again.

293
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,240
Weir, I beg you.

294
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,829
Don’t touch me!

295
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,170
Weir.

296
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,119
Weir.

297
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,559
In the end, Mom confessed to Dad

298
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,920
and they got a divorce.

299
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,859
I haven’t returned home since I graduated from high school.

300
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,240
Before I knew it, I couldn't face my mom anymore.

301
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,150
Since then, I’ve been scared of women.

302
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,279
I don’t want them to be near me.

303
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,359
I don’t want them to touch me.

304
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,259
Whenever a girl comes near me,

305
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:51,309
that picture of Mom and Teacher Noom pops up in my mind.

306
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,650
I understand you, Weir.

307
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,900
You’re not scared of women.

308
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,880
You’re just scared of being disappointed

309
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,930
and scared to trust after you’ve been hurt.

310
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,049
It’s alright, Chef.

311
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,119
Thank you so much, guys.

312
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,730
Weir.

313
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,150
Mom.

314
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,569
It’s alright.

315
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,660
I was just scared you’d drop these.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,009
Talk to your mom.

317
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,009
How are you, son?

318
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,339
I just want to talk to you.

319
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:30,079
Weir, Mom just wants to apologize to you.

320
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,079
Weir.

321
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,210
Weir,

322
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,779
don’t do this.

323
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,450
It won’t make anything better.

324
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,619
You can’t run forever.

325
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,759
But it’s no use talking to her.

326
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,519
You of all people should understand

327
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,200
how we can’t forget our painful past.

328
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,400
Okay.

329
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,940
You can go out through the back entrance and take another day off.

330
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,710
I made Weir work too hard and he’s not feeling well,

331
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,950
so I sent him home.

332
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,140
I know Weir doesn’t want to see me.

333
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,140
He must hate me a lot.

334
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,630
I cheated on my husband.

335
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,119
Mom.

336
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,180
It’s okay, View.

337
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,960
It’s the truth and I’m ready to talk about it.

338
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,940
I cheated on my husband and Weir saw it.

339
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:06,490
I destroyed my family with my own hands.

340
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,650
Most importantly,

341
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,549
he was Weir’s first love.

342
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:16,299
Does this mean…?

343
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:16,990
Yes.

344
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,480
I cheated on my husband with Weir’s first love.

345
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,359
I’m a terrible mother.

346
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,630
I made my son despise me so much that he’s too scared to get close to any girl.

347
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,430
But something good happened to Weir.

348
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,609
These days, he’s very happy to be here with us.

349
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,829
Thank you so much for hiring him.

350
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,359
No problem at all.

351
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,920
You and view can rest assured

352
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,920
that we take good care of Weir here.

353
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,529
More like Chef is the one taking care of us.

354
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,690
I’m glad that Weir got a job at a good place

355
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,000
and has good friends who care about him.

356
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,140
Thank you so much.

357
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:13,160
Mom, you and View don’t have to worry.

358
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,400
As a regular customer here,

359
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,799
I’m sure Weir will overcome his fear of women one day.

360
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,900
There are no problems that can't be solved.

361
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,000
I believe so.

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,769
Mom? Since when did you become her daughter?

363
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,450
Shut up, Ting Nong Noy.

364
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,450
Are you two dating?

365
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,269
No.

366
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,390
Mom,

367
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,599
may I ask you a favor?

368
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,019
Of course.

369
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,680
You asked us to come here because you have something to tell us, right?

370
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,589
I can’t deal with this anymore.

371
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,509
It’s getting out of hand.

372
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,880
I can’t keep Tert under control anymore.

373
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
What happened?

374
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,920
Tert…

375
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,519
What did he do?

376
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,970
Tert randomly disappeared the other day

377
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,960
so I followed him out.

378
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,519
Tert, don’t.

379
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:12,750
What are you doing?

380
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,490
Our son has run away.

381
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
That’s not our son, Tert.

382
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,140
We have to find our son.

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,140
He’s missing.

384
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,309
We have to find him.

385
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,660
He hasn’t come back home.

386
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,750
Do you know what day it is?

387
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,660
Of course I do.

388
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:33,647
It’s the day our son went missing.

389
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:39,776
We have to find our son, Nuan.

390
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:41,769
Do you understand?

391
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,296
We have to find our son.

392
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,768
Trust me. Our son may have gotten lost.

393
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:49,519
Trust me.	Please, Nuan.

394
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:51,839
Tert,

395
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,271
did you kidnap the kids?

396
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:00,991
The kids?

397
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,990
When I went to stay with my mom,

398
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:11,200
did you kidnap the kids to our house?

399
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:14,544
Did you, Tert?

400
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:17,567
Did you?

401
00:26:20,688 --> 00:26:21,920
Did you, Tert?

402
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,784
I thought that I knew my husband well and that I was capable of taking care of him.

403
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,471
But from that moment on,

404
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,567
I didn’t know who he was anymore.

405
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,895
Since that day, he’s gone missing

406
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,672
and he hasn’t come home.

407
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,607
I don’t know where he is

408
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,271
or what he plans to do.

409
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:54,928
I don’t know if he killed those kids.

410
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,799
Hello, what’s up?

411
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,423
Jean, are you busy?

412
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,087
Can you come over?

413
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,864
I’m a little busy right now with the café.

414
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:42,400
Is everything alright?

415
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,688
Will you go to the club with me?

416
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,215
I can’t today.

417
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:48,751
Can we go tomorrow?

418
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,680
But I really want to see you.

419
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,144
Jean, dinner is ready. Come eat.

420
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:57,599
Our children are waiting.

421
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:14,240
You’re married?

422
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,864
All this time you’ve been lying to me, haven’t you?

423
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,160
Did you ever love me?

424
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,008
Yes.

425
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:57,231
I love you.

426
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,480
If I say I love you, it means I really do.

427
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:02,319
I really love you, Weir.

428
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,369
Love?

429
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,087
How could it be love when you did this to me?

430
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,079
What about your wife and children?

431
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:10,415
Do you love them at all?

432
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,864
Weir, love comes in many forms.

433
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:18,655
Feeling you love someone is already love.

434
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:22,569
You don’t have to love only one person.

435
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:22,576
You don’t have to love only one person.Stop crafting your sentences.

436
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,384
Stop crafting your sentences.

437
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,144
No matter how beautiful your words are,

438
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,023
this shitty behavior won’t make you look better.

439
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:41,440
Did you know that I ran away to France and refused to go home because my mom cheated on my dad?

440
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:45,488
Look at me now. I’m having an affair with someone’s spouse.

441
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,288
It really hurts.

442
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:49,327
Listen to me.

443
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,352
We love each other, don’t we?

444
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,023
You don’t have to worry about my family.

445
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,640
I’ll handle it.

446
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:58,256
Jean, we have to break up.

447
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:01,935
We can’t.

448
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,031
You’re crazy about me.

449
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,029
How can you be such an asshole?

450
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:07,471
Weir.

451
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:09,743
I’m an asshole?

452
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,215
You slept around but I didn’t say anything.

453
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,496
I was single then.

454
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:15,855
I was single.

455
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,496
But you can’t live a double life.

456
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,240
Why not?

457
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,784
My dad could.

458
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,392
He shared his love for everyone.

459
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,703
I’m the same.

460
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,720
I can share my love for both you and family.

461
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,736
My mom once told me adult relationships are complicated.

462
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:44,144
I get it now.

463
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:50,192
I get that it’s just an excuse adults give to children when they want to do something selfish.

464
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,256
Weir.

465
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,248
Did Krating make these?

466
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,056
Your mom’s cookies.

467
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,776
She made some for everyone at the café.

468
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,304
Even Mone got a few boxes home.

469
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:12,688
She made that box specially for you.

470
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:20,576
Now you know what flavor was missing from the cookies.

471
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,569
It’s your mom’s flavor.

472
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,056
The woman you’ve been avoiding for over ten years.

473
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:32,539
It’s the flavor of family.

474
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,160
Why did you have to build up drama?

475
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:54,256
Do you love seeing me cry that much?

476
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:02,304
I want you to talk things out with your mom.

477
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:06,096
Chef,

478
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,031
you still have your mom, your sister,

479
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,768
and many others who are your family.

480
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:22,367
and a home to go back to.

481
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:28,304
No dishes are as delicious as what your mom makes.

482
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,880
Maybe your fear can be overcome with forgiveness.

483
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:45,248
She made a mistake in the past but she owns up to it and tries her best to fix it.

484
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,223
You should give her a chance.

485
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:56,064
But there’s someone else who shouldn’t be given another chance to hurt you again.

486
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:03,392
Who are you talking about?

487
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:07,759
Before you got home, Jean was waiting for you here

488
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,487
so we heard about your fight.

489
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,831
But I sent him away.

490
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:16,128
More like you begged him to leave.

491
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,824
I’m sorry for troubling you guys again.

492
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,367
It’s alright.

493
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:37,280
But please remember that people who make amends are different from people who make excuses.

494
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:41,760
It’s your choice what kind of people you want in your life.

495
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:47,952
Thank you.

496
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:51,407
Thank you all.

497
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,000
Where are you going, Chef?

498
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:58,112
To make desserts, of course.

499
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,231
To make desserts for my family members.

500
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:24,159
We spoke to Ms. Nuan, Mr.Tert’s wife.

501
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:28,831
We’re sure he kidnapped Mr. Punn.

502
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:31,840
Remember the case from 21 years ago I told you about?

503
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:39,552
One boy was kidnapped and ended up getting killed. It was Mr. Tert’s son.

504
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:43,615
After he lost his son,

505
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,784
he started suffering from mental illness	and having hallucinations.

506
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,344
He thinks every boy he sees is his son.

507
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,159
I think that’s why Mr. Punn was kidnapped.

508
00:35:57,311 --> 00:36:00,090
Now another scary thing has happened.

509
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,096
Now another scary thing has happened.What is it?

510
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,007
What is it?

511
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,056
Mr. Tert relapsed and disappeared from his house.

512
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:10,880
Ms. Nuan is very worried something bad might happen again.

513
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,407
Why didn’t you guys tell me sooner?

514
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,976
I could have helped you investigate.

515
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,880
Your father and I are in part responsible for his condition.

516
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,903
What do you mean?

517
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,023
He asked us to report the news about his son’s disappearance

518
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,791
hoping it will help him find the boy sooner

519
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:39,376
but we chose to focus on another news that more people were interested in.

520
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:43,519
If we hadn’t abandoned Mr. Tert’s case,

521
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:46,175
this wouldn’t have happened.

522
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:50,096
No kids would have been kidnapped.

523
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:58,335
So you didn’t tell me because you were scared I’d be disappointed in you?

524
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:08,672
We’ve always kept up our appearances and taught you to be a high-principled journalist,

525
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:15,791
but we have poor journalism ethics ourselves.

526
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:17,360
We’re ashamed.

527
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,367
That’s why we never told you this story in detail.

528
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:25,456
Dad, Mom,

529
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,648
I can never be disappointed in you guys,

530
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,503
because what you’re doing right now

531
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,096
is trying to fix your past mistake.

532
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,480
Stop blaming yourselves and let’s fix the problem together.

533
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:45,440
Thanks.

534
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:46,447
Thanks.

535
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,023
If the three of us work together,

536
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,864
we will surely be successful.

537
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,807
What’s Meena doing?

538
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,800
Hey, don’t hurt me!

539
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,735
Calm down. I’m your teacher.

540
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,784
You’re in primary grades. What are you doing here?

541
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:20,016
Mesa.

542
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:27,103
Sorry I’m late. I had to submit an assignment.

543
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,344
Is something wrong, Mr. Toomtam?

544
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:35,552
No, I saw her standing alone, so I said hi.

545
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,824
It’s alright, Mesa. Mr. Toomtam is my assistant.

546
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:46,768
Please excuse us. We have an assignment to work on at Meena’s.

547
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:50,896
Safe trip and please take care of her.

548
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:51,456
We will.

549
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,016
Bye, Mesa.

550
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,367
That girl seems paranoid.

551
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:01,711
Is she alright?

552
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,519
She was kidnapped.

553
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,215
Kidnapped?

554

555
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,449
Not yet,

556
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:09,456
Not yet,but they suspect the desserts murderer in the news.

557
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:13,920
but they suspect the desserts murderer in the news.

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,911
All set.

559
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,072
Those look good, Chef.

560
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,840
Of course they do. It’s your first time making them in ten years.

561
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:38,623
I hope both will like them.

562
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,672
You closed the café for us?

563
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:47,775
Mm.

564
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:54,416
Mom.

565
00:39:59,423 --> 00:40:00,096
Well…

566
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:05,400
Please have a seat.

567
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,016
You can do it.

568
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:28,847
Mom,

569
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,199
all this time

570
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:38,000
whenever I made Thai tea almond cookies,

571
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,920
I would always feel that something was missing.

572
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,920
ut you know my recipe.

573
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,184
Even if I do,

574
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,000
and no matter how hard I try,

575
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,255
something was still missing.

576
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:14,784
But now I know what’s missing.

577
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:56,784
I’m sorry, Mom.

578
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,744
I’m sorry I disappeared for so long.

579
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,416
View,

580
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:17,775
I’m sorry.

581
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,016
Can I try your cookies, son?

582
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:38,976
Please do.

583
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,239
I made these for you and View.

584
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:50,784
