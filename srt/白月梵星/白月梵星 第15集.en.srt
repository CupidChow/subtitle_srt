truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

Long time no see.

How are you?

22
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,280
I left Ning'an City

23
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,220
and am now back in Ning'an City.

24
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,040
Many things happened along the way

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,100
and I learned a lot.

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,220
I had a few near-death experiences.

27
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,680
Fortunately, Fan Yue has been protecting me

28

so I'm safe.

29

There are only two stars left now.

36
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,030
Master, do you have a solution?

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,000
I've tried all the common elixirs

38
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,410
but they didn't work.

39
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,940
You once said

40
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,710
there was a first-grade elixir in the world.

41
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,670
It can even withstand the thunder tribulation of a high-up Eternal ascending.

because you have "Mu" in your written name.

But you are the Demon King of the Polar Region.

And that's all you're going to do?

having to ask you to take the risk to come to this dangerous place.

The Cold Spring Palace is heavily guarded.

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,870
If anything happens to Master,

123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,070
even death is a light punishment for me.

124
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,900
You are in danger.

125
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,390
How can I stand by and watch?

126
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,800
You've suffered.

127
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,260
Take this pill.

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,620
It can protect your heart and meridians.

129

Fu Ling

130
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,020
saved you?

131
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,850
Yes.

132
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,150
Fu Ling used her demonic flower armor

133
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,980
to protect me from the attack.

134
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,440
But don't worry, Master.

135
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,240
I've killed the demonic flower

136
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,820
and am no longer a puppet of a demoness.

137
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,710
60,000 years ago, the Hidden Lord cause turmoil in the world

138
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,830
and the Divine Race perished.

139
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,710
There is no more gods in the world.

140
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,800
But Zhen Yu took the risk

141
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,520
of having the Eternals and demons join hands

142
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,940
and proposed the Deity-making Formation.

143
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,520
This formation seems to be a trap,

144
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,450
but it has all kinds of deception.

145
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,440
If it's not traceable,

146
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,380
the King of Outlanders wouldn't believe it easily.

147
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,170
Besides, does Zhen Yu's motive of using the divine sword

148
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,710
to retrieve the divine stone have something to do with Deity-making?

149
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,040
This remains

150
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,160
unknown to us.

151
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,430
If he succeeds in Deity-making,

152
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,730
everyone will be in danger.

153
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,440
Why don’t you

154
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,870
gather everyone to attack the Cold Spring?

155
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,140
I can't do that.

156
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,570
We don't know Cold Spring's army size and actual plans.

157
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,910
Other than Fu Ling,

158
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,260
there's another Demon Lord

159
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,570
named Chen Ye under Zhen Yu.

160
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,040
He is good at engineering military weapons and drug production.

161
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,770
He is evil

162
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,390
but few have seen his face.

163
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,900
Cold Spring

164
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,710
is really unpredictable.

165
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,290
Since Fu Ling saved you,

166
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,610
you can take this chance

167
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,600
to join Cold Spring

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,750
to collect internal information

169
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,080
to attack Zhen Yu's vital point

170
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
and destroy his plan.

171
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,580
Master, you...

172
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,660
I know.

173
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,910
This is putting you on the spot.

174
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,180
But among the Eternals,

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,110
you are the only immortal

176
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,430
who can enter the Cold Spring.

177
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,570
Since they want something from you,

178
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,630
they won’t hurt you easily.

179
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,310
Chong Zhao,

180
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,950
I have always treated you as my own son.

181
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,930
I don't want you

182
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,490
to be in danger.

183
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,630
But now,

184
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,200
not only Lanling needs you,

185
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,620
but all Eternals and demons need you.

186
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,700
So I

187
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,990
can only put you in danger.

188
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,800
You have a strong moral mind.

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,090
I believe

190
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,910
even if you are within darkness,

191
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,290
you won't be swallowed by it.

192
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,780
I understand.

193
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,570
I will do my best

194
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,000
and not let you down.

195
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,200
I will investigate Cold Spring's schemes.

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,080
Take care.

197
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,280
All Eternals will be proud of you.

198
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,650
Master.

199
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,950
If Shuo asks–

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,120
If you have to draw your sword against Bai Shuo,

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,150
I will explain it to her.

202
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,020
Okay.

203
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,030
All right.

204
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,490
Master.

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,130
I think we should buy a five-person table.

206
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,040
Why?

207
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,810
I'm happy to sit with you.

208
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,210
Do I look happy?

209
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,080
I think you should be happy.

210
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Have a taste.

211
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,100
These dishes

212
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,930
were sincerely made by me.

213
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,850
Even my aunt has never eaten my cooking.

214
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,090
Here, try this.

215
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,500
Here, Bai Shuo.

216
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,020
It tastes good.

217
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,890
Right?

218
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,130
Bai Shuo.

219
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,090
Why is

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,580
your nose bleeding again?

221
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,400
Again?

222
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
What's going on?

223
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
It bled a few times.

224
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,060
Maybe it's because of internal heat.

225
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,220
How many times?

226
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,180
Two to three times?

227
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,360
Three to four times?

228
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,390
It's no big deal.

229
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,870
You should not hide any of your

230
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,130
health issues from me.

231
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,580
When did this start?

232
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,890
Since we returned from the Outlanders' City.

233
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,640
Did this happen to the previous King of Outlanders

234
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
after they put on the Outlander King's Ring?

235
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
Not that I heard of.

236
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,540
Does it have something to do with the ring?

237
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,080
But...

238
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,250
But what?

239
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,980
When I put the sword back in the Outlanders' City's Underground Palace,

240
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,440
I did feel a surge of

241
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,970
new power in my body.

242
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,480
Could it be that the Contemplation Stone reacted

243
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,740
with the Divine Sword?

244
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,480
Does this power still exist?

245
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,960
I don't know.

246
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,950
After that, I've never

247
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,350
felt that power anymore.

248
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,000
Try activating your internal energy.

249
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,010
Look.

250
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,400
Nothing happened.

251
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,150
Did the sword spirit mistake me for someone else?

252
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,640
The Outlander King's Ring's doesn't acknowledge

253
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,170
anyone as its owner easily.

254
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,530
Lend me your tortise shell.

255
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,000
Are you looking for my master again?

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,150
If Lanling finds out, he'll be punished again.

257
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,270
I'll be careful.

258
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,530
I'll go too then.

259
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,970
It's more convenient for me to go alone.

260
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,210
You stay here

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
to cultivate elixirs for me.

262
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,050
Fine.

263
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,780
Please say hello to Master for me.

264
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,980
Don't put him on the spot.

265
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,180
No.

266
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,850
No one's eating

267
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,110
such delicious food?

268
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,460
My disciple's nose is bleeding?

269
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,490
Why didn't she

270
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,300
mention this in the letter?

271
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,790
She said

272
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,240
she has absorbed another Contemplation

273
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,490
in the Outlanders' City.

274
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,290
That's right.

275
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,380
It's related to the Contemplation Stone.

276
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,450
My disciple is a mortal,

277
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,110
but the Contemplation Stone is an ancient divine object.

278
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,010
Before a Contemplation is absorbed,

279
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,040
Contemplation Stone is just a stone.

280
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,710
The more it absorbs,

281
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,630
the stronger the energy is.

282
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,340
As a mortal,

283
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,050
how can she handle

284
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,280
divine power?

285
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,120
The nose bleed

286
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,880
is just the beginning.

287
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,090
When the

288
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,810
Five Contemplations are all gathered

289
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,850
and the Contemplation Stone activates...

290
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,090
What will happen?

291
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,170
Her body will explode and die.

292
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,150
Why didn't you say that earlier?

293
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,320
Although I know divination,

294
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,840
I can only know after

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,960
I calculate it.

296
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,270
Only because you told me

297
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,390
my disciple is sick,

298
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,780
so I could tell it's because of the Contemplation Stone.

299
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,960
How do we solve this?

300
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,350
There is a way to do so.

301
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,320
The Fox Clan has a treasure

302
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,750
called Weak Water Stone.

303
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,790
This is

304
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,960
birthed from the love

305
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,630
of the Fox Clan's ancestors.

306
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,320
Whoever gets the Weak Water Stone

307
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,500
will have endless spiritual power.

308
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,370
This power can suppress

309
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,590
Bai Shuo's backlash brought by the Contemplation Stone.

310
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,670
My disciple said that you lost a star in Outlanders' City.

311
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,820
Let me have a look.

312
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,640
No need.

313
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,990
I have things to tend to.

314
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,020
You've been cultivating elixirs day and night.

315
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,550
That's very sincere of you.

316
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,829
What are you trying to say?

317
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,030
Be straightforward.

318
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,510
Since the first time Master

319
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,369
brought you to Bright Moon Palace,

320
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,130
I knew he now has a weakness.

321
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,450
This weakness is you.

322
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,569
The Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on him

323
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,420
can only be erased by the divine power of the Contemplation Stone.

324
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,770
I know he will never hurt you.

325
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,750
If...

326
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,630
If one day

327
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,860
Master needs you,

328
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,340
I hope you won't betray him.

329
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,580
I will bind my life

330
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,330
to Fan Yue's.

331
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,200
Who wants

332
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,250
that?

333
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,590
What do you mean by that?

334
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,410
What did you mean?

335
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,820
Your life is yours.

336
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,810
My life is mine.

337
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
Why should they be bound?

338
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,330
Did Master tell you something?

339
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,310
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

340
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,570
No.

341
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,620
I'll ask him myself.

342
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,270
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

343
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,350
You weren't like this

344
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,400
before you went to Master.

345
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,370
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

346
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,750
Like what?

347
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,630
I've always been like this.

348
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,830
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

349
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:46,630
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

350
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,790
You're not eating, drinking,

351
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,120
nor making any noise.

352
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,900
How calm of you.

353
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
But

354
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,830
I'm impatient.

355
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,580
How about we play a game today?

356
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,350
It's not fun if it's just the two of us playing it.

357
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,480
We need more people.

358
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
For example,

359
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,890
with your Eternal friends.

360
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,860
I don't understand what you mean.

361
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,150
You're not killing me

362
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,530
nor letting me go.

363
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,830
What are you trying to do?

364
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,540
I've never stopped you.

365
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,330
But

366
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,970
with your injury,

367
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,790
can you walk out of Cold Spring?

368
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,750
The other demons in Cold Spring Palace are different from me.

369
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,310
If they catch a delicate Eternal,

370
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,120
they will eat you.

371
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,790
Divinity,

372
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,280
the game I prepared for you

373
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,820
is about to begin.

374
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,490
What are you doing?

375
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,820
I told you.

376
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,560
I want to play a game

377
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,900
with you.

378
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,960
If you kill one of them,

379
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,120
I'll let the rest

380
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,470
go.

381
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,400
Divinity.

382
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,480
You wasted this opportunity.

383
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,000
No!

384
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,690
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

385
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,370
If you listened to me,

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,270
all four of them can live.

387
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,480
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

388
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,670
But you didn't give them

389
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,450
the chance to live.

390
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,570
I'll let you choose again.

391
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,540
Kill one of these four.

392
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:01,570
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

393
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,920
As for the rest,

394
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,270
I can let them go.

395
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,200
You demoness...

396
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,070
Why don't you just kill me?

397
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,540
It's boring to kill you.

398
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,540
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

399
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
It's fun to force you to kill an Eternal.

400
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,710
Why?

401
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,670
You can't do it?

402
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,670
♫Across thousands of miles♫

403
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,290
Fellow Eternal...

404
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,940
Fellow Eternal...

405
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,380
Fellow Eternal...

406
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,790
Divinity Chong Zhao,

407
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,160
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

408
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,630
you lost another chance to save your fellow Eternals.

409
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,260
Now there are three people left.

410
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,630
The rules are the same.

411
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,850
Let's start.

412
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:38,160
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

413
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,020
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

414
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,370
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

415
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:00,500
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

416
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:10,290
♫To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart♫

417
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,480
♫I'm your wanderer♫

418
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,480
Sorry...

419
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,310
♫The flowers flew away♫

420
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,050
♫My tears are streaming down like rain♫

421
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:42,290
♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

422
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,630
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

423
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,110
Go!

424
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,120
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

425
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,400
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

426
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,350
♫My love brought tears♫

427
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,350
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

428
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,390
Didn't you say you'd let them go?

429
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,410
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

430
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,180
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

431
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,240
This is the second thing

432
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
about being a demon that I'm teaching you.

433
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,800
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

434
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:09,860
A demon

435
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,740
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

436
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,440
is not credible.

437
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,030
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

438
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,280
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

439
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
The evil insects Chen Ye made are really something.

440
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,590
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

441
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,270
I'm really looking forward to how amazing

442
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,430
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

443
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,630
he will be after he has absorbed

444
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,630
enough demon pith,

445
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,570
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

446
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,590
Eternal arteries, and human lives.

447
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,800
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

448
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,570
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

449
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,190
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

450
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,880
Other than Fu Ling,

451
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,410
there's another Demon Lord

452
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,390
named Chen Ye under Zhen Yu.

453
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,290
He is good at engineering military weapons and drug production.

454
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,890
He is evil

455
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,600
but few have seen his face.

456
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
I've killed an Eternal

457
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,340
and betrayed my sect

458
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,790
as you wished.

459
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,720
Are you satisfied?

460
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,820
Welcome, Lord Chong Zhao,

461
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
to the Cold Spring Palace.

462
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,120
Master.

463
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,180
What happened?

464
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,210
-What’s wrong–
-Bai Shuo can't absorb anymore Contemplations.

465
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,570
Why?

466
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,850
She's just a human.

467
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,290
She can't withstand the divine power of the Contemplation Stone.

468
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,350
The nosebleed is just the beginning.

469
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,880
If she keeps absorbing Contemplations,

470
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,460
her body will explode.

471
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,960
What about you?

472
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,060
Are you going to give up collecting Contemplations for her?

473
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,200
I thought you and her

474
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
have established some friendship.

475
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,880
Bai Shuo saved the Outlanders' City

476
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,840
and Hua Yong,

477
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,630
so I can repay that with my life.

478
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,770
But this concerns your life.

479
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,990
Bright Moon Palace needs its master.

480
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,530
No matter who ceases to exist,

481
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,030
the world still goes on.

482
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,680
My life is up to me.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,660
Even the heavens can't stop me

484
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,380
from protecting the people I want to.

485
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Where is Mu Jiu?

486
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,290
He's still in the Unbridled Pavilion, right?

487
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,370
Mu Jiu?

488
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,780
There is a treasure called Weak Water Stone in the Fox Clan.

489
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,540
If Bai Shuo can have that,

490
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,630
she can suppress Contemplation Stone's backlash.

491
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,370
I'll go look for Mu Jiu now.

492
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,160
Huo?

493
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,290
Why are you here?

494
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,970
Why are you in my room

495
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,460
in the middle of the night?

496
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,880
You miss me?

497
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,480
I heard that there are many treasures

498
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,720
in Jingyou Mountain.

499
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,810
Why are you

500
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,970
coveting the treasure of our Fox Clan?

501
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,180
But it doesn't matter.

502
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,230
You're Huo.

503
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,050
I can give you

504
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,550
any treasure you want.

505
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,910
But...

506
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,170
But what?

507
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,830
Today's been tiring.

508
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,710
I have a headache

509
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,980
and I'm aching all over.

510
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,150
If someone

511
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,510
can give me a massage,

512
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,850
maybe...

513
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,190
I was just kidding.

514
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,450
Just kidding.

515
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
You don't have to...

516
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,240
Massage where?

517
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,570
Then...

518
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,560
Massage here.

519
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,270
It hurts.

520
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,250
It hurts...

521
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,350
Here, here...

522
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,870
It hurts!

523
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,770
It hurts.

524
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,200
That's enough.

525
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,480
It's great.

526
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,350
By the way,

527
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,370
our Fox Clan has

528
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,440
many treasures.

529
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,660
Which one do you want?

530
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,770
How about this?

531
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,660
Why don't you

532
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,070
go back to Jingyou Mountain with me

533
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,870
and be my wife?

534
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,550
By then,

535
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,670
you can choose whatever treasure

536
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,760
you want.

537
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,240
Young Master.

538
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,510
Young Master.

539
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,800
You're really here.

540
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,210
Chang Sheng?

541
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,260
Elder,

542
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,290
why are you here?

543
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,070
Master has ordered

544
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,120
[Chang Sheng,
Demon Race,
Elder of Fox Clan]

545
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,910
for me to take you back to Jingyou Mountain.

546
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,950
I'm not going back.

547
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,130
Master said

548
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,290
if you don't obey,

549
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,910
I can use force.

550
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,870
Huo, save me.

551
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,200
Since your master has given the order,

552
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
if I were to stop you,

553
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,270
it would be rude of me.

554
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,370
But our master asked me

555
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,980
to protect your young master.

556
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,730
If I lose him,

557
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,430
I won't be able to explain it.

558
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,550
What do you want then?

559
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,860
Your young master invited me to the Fox Clan.

560
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,530
Let me be your guest then.

561
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,420
But that's not an invitation from my master.

562
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,030
But I want to go.

563
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,900
Shuo.

564
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,870
Are you okay?

565
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,670
The human body

566
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,970
can't withstand the power of the Contemplation Stone.

567
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,650
If this continues,

568
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,950
Bai Shuo will die.

569
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,210
Fan Yue,

570
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,380
if you really care about her,

571
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,630
you can't allow her

572
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,410
to continue absorbing the Five Contemplations.

573
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,130
Go back and rest.

574
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,990
I don't need you to cultivate elixirs anymore.

575
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,620
You said yesterday that

576
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,570
your life is yours

577
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,110
and my life is mine.

578
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,110
Please behave yourself.

579
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,640
Leave me alone.

580
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,250
Master.

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
Bad news.

582
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,470
Something happened to Tian Huo and Mu Jiu.

583
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,830
I've searched all of Unbridled Pavilion.

584
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,460
It's neat everywhere else.

585
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,270
Only Mu Jiu's room has signs of fighting.

586
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,360
Tian Huo and Mu Jiu

587
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,980
must have disappeared here.

588
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,060
It's the Fox Clan.

589
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,610
Did Tian Huo go to the Fox Clan to look for the Weak Water Stone?

590
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,940
This is a burn mark left by a Fox Clan spell.

591
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,620
A Fox Clan spell?

592
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,750
Master.

593
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,960
Bright Moon Palace and Fox Clan

594
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,440
never interfere with each other.

595
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,640
It must be Mu Jiu who caused the trouble.

596
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,830
He was kidnapped along with the Tian Huo.

597
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,350
Master.

598
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,350
Let's go to the Fox Clan to save them.

599
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,720
Master,

600
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,510
Ms. Bai, why aren't you worried?

601
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,140
Tian Huo knows what to do.

602
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,230
Her spiritual power is not weak either.

603
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,940
Even if Fox Clan's Chang Mei came,

604
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,520
they couldn't have taken the both of them away

605
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,830
from Unbridled Pavilion without making a sound.

606
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,940
What do you mean?

607
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,850
It's easy for Tian Huo

608
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,400
to make a ruckus.

609
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,450
Obviously,

610
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,080
she didn't want to alarm us.

611
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,440
Why?

612
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,980
If they alarmed you,

613
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,690
they wouldn't be able to leave.

614
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,370
Then,

615
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Tian Huo couldn't go to the Fox Clan.

616
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,920
You mean

617
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Tian Huo wasn't abducted?

618
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,330
She went to the Fox Clan willingly?

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,710
[Jingyou Mountain,
Demon Race]

620
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,730
Auntie.

621
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,600
If I hadn't sent Chang Sheng to find you,

622
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,980
[Chang Mei,
Demon Race,
Master of Jingyou Mountain]

623
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,290
will you still remember me?

624
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,190
Greetings, Master of Jingyou Mountain.

625
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,600
No need for the formalities, Lady Tian Huo.

626
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,550
I don’t deserve being greeted

627
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,360
by the guardian of the Bright Moon Palace.

628
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,970
You are one of the Three Kings of the Demon Race.

629
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,870
How could you say that?

630
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,890
Is that so?

631
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,130
Then why did you

632
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,800
come uninvited?

633
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,820
Aunt.

634
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,770
This has nothing to do with Tian Huo.

635
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,730
I know.

636
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,370
You want me to come back to Jingyou Mountain

637
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,790
to force me to inherit the Master position

638
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,990
and manage Jingyou Mountain, right?

639
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,230
Aunt,

640
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,580
don't you know what I'm capable of?

641
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,440
Me?

642
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,590
Manage the Fox Clan?

643
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,830
I'm not worthy.

644
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,110
What do you want to do if not that then?

645
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,120
Join the Bright Moon Palace?

646
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,030
Three days later will be

647
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,960
your Master Succession Ceremony.

648
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,270
Chang Sheng and Chang Wu have made the preparations

649
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,270
for the ceremony.

650
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,380
You're not allowed to go anywhere these few days.

651
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,810
Otherwise, I'll break your leg.

652
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,360
Why do you want me to inherit your position?

653
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,710
I said I don't want to.

654
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,870
You don't want to?

655
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,710
Fine.

656
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,660
I shall kill

657
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,600
Lady Tian Huo then.

658
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,890
Cang Shan.

659
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,140
Get ready.

660
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,460
We'll set off to Jingyou Mountain now.

661
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,970
You stay.

662
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,820
Why?

663
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,640
This is a Bright Moon Palace matter.

664
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,010
It has nothing to do with you.

665
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,270
Tian Huo and I went through

666
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,600
thick and thin in Outlanders' City.

667
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,870
We're friends.

668
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,010
There must be a reason

669
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,370
for her going to the Fox Clan.

670
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,190
As her friend, I should–

671
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,450
Where she goes has nothing to do with you.

672
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,100
Jingyou Mountain is a demon territory.

673
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,920
You're a human

674
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,810
with no spiritual power.

675
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,600
If you follow us,

676
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,000
you'll only drag us down.

677
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,910
How can you threaten me with Tian Huo?

678
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,510
This has nothing to do with her.

679
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,620
Why didn't you come home?

680
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,000
You first went to the Outlanders' City,

681
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,420
then you went to the Human Race.

682
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,360
How many days has it been?

683
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,090
I haven't heard from you at all.

684
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,700
Do you really care about the Fox Clan

685
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,090
or me at all?

686
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,000
These...

687
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,340
These are all my fault.

688
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,630
But Tian Huo has nothing to do with these.

689
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,810
I insisted on following her.

690
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,610
Shut up!

691
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,570
She's under Fan Yue.

692
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,510
Don’t you know the relationship

693
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,880
between Jingyou Mountain and Bright Moon Palace?

694
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,170
Why would she approach you of all people?

695
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,270
What is she up to?

696
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,640
Have you ever thought about it with your brain?

697
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,510
Master, that's not right.

698
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,390
Jingyou Mountain and Bright Moon Palace

699
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,880
never interfered with each other.

700
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,760
You are the leader of a clan.

701
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,240
You should think

702
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,790
before you speak.

703
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,310
How dare you

704
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,040
refute me?

705
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,860
I dare not.

706
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,890
But this concerns my master.

707
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,800
I must explain.

708
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,070
Master?

709
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,130
Why are you here?

710
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,219
Did the tortoise shell I gave you break?

711
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,409
I sensed the tortoise shell cracking,

712
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,639
so I came to see it.

713
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,989
Where is Fan Yue?

714
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,480
You fought?

715
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
Master.

716
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,670
What did Fan Yue talk to you about?

717
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,670
After he came back,

718
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,030
it was like he's a different person.

719
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,889
The two of you...

720
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,110
one's terribly unlucky

721
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,800
and the other is a living hell.

722
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,840
You two can make a scene

723
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,590
behind closed doors.

724
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,150
But why do you have to torture me too?

725
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,150
Fine.

726
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,860
I've lived thousands of years.

727
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,710
I shall consider doing this for merit.

728
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,910
Let me ask you.

729
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,410
Did Fan Yue

730
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,750
go somewhere far?

731
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,920
How did you know?

732
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,290
Not only do I know,

733
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,930
I also know that he went to the Fox Clan.

734
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,540
You know that too?

735
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Why didn't he take you there?

736
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,960
He said I'm an outsider.

737
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,580
He said that without spiritual power,

738
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,590
I'll only drag them down.

739
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,760
Why can't you use your tricks

740
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,590
when it comes to him?

741
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,380
You believe whatever he says?

742
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,790
Of course not.

743
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,570
I just don't want to fight him head-on again.

744
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,710
If you didn't come,

745
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,890
I was going to go check out the Fox Clan.

746
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,840
Master,

747
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,150
be straightforward.

748
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,070
Don't hide things from me.

749
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,050
And don't lie to me.

750
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,830
I can tell you.

751
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,630
But

752
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,850
you have to answer a question first.

753
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,280
What is it?

754
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,430
Do you have feelings for Fan Yue?

755
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,030
How...

756
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,450
How is that possible?

757
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,730
I'm mad at him now.

758
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,940
How could he

759
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,510
just change like that?

760
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,950
Look.

761
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,900
You're so in love.

762
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,890
In the letter you wrote to me,

763
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,390
it was all about Fan Yue.

764
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,080
Your mood changes

765
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,150
with his mood.

766
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,150
How can you say you're not in love?

767
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,810
I...

768
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,390
The lovers in this world

769
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,940
do all things

770
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,760
for each other,

771
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,450
yet they always misunderstand

772
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,220
and even miss out each other.

773
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,530
My disciple,

774
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,890
there are only two stars left on Fan Yue.

775
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,580
But now he's going to the Fox Clan for a treasure.

776
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,830
It's dangerous.

777
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,740
A treasure?

778
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,990
Fan Yue went

779
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,580
for a treasure of the Fox Clan

780
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,720
called Weak Water Stone.

781
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,550
But the master of the Fox Clan Chang Mei

782
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,920
has a bad temper and is inflexible.

783
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,520
How could she give away the treasure so easily?

784
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,470
You know how badly Fan Yue is injured.

785
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,770
There will be a fierce battle.

786
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,120
Why did he go to get a treasure?

787
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,510
Does that need a reason?

788
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,400
Of course it's because...

789
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,540
this treasure is good.

790
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,750
With Fan Yue's current condition,

791
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,800
if he fights with the entire Fox Clan,

792
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,770
another star

793
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,460
might fall.

794
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,360
My good disciple!

795
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,710
Don't tell Fan Yue I told you this

796
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,280
when you see him!

797
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Aunt,

798
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,570
I lost my parents when I was young.

799
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,420
You raised me.

800
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,440
In my heart,

801
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,210
I've treated you as my own mother.

802
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,630
Even if I marry Tian Huo,

803
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,150
I will never forget you.

804
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,490
I was born weaker than others.

805
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,580
When I was young,

806
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,530
there weren't many I could defeat.

807
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,220
I was bullied for this.

808
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
I've grown up now.

809
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,300
Those guys

810
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,940
seem to respect me and fear me,

811
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,870
but it's all for your sake.

812
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,890
It's fine if it was in the past.

813
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,100
I fear nothing in this vast world because I'm reckless.

814
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,180
But this time,

815
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,500
after being to the Outlanders' City,

816
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,380
I found out the world is so huge

817
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,120
and there are countless powerful Eternals and demons.

818
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,990
Aunt,

819
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,410
if you really hand over

820
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,730
the Fox Clan to me,

821
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,660
aren't you afraid

822
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,130
I will ruin the foundation

823
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,900
you've built up over thousands of years?

824
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
Since you know these,

825
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,150
you should cultivate harder

826
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,810
so that you can protect yourself

827
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,860
and the Fox Clan,

828
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,740
instead of chasing after women

829
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,360
without behaving properly.

830
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,790
Aunt,

831
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,760
I know how you feel.

832
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,270
But I don't want to

833
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,970
go against my will.

834
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
I like Tian Huo.

835
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,370
I like freedom.

836
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,140
Jingyou Mountain is too small.

837
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,280
The responsibility of a master is too much too.

838
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,730
Aunt,

839
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,280
if you really care about me,

840
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,820
please let me go.

841
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,020
I also want you to be happy.

842
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,990
But...

843
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,130
You're willing to

844
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,940
give up everything for Tian Huo.

845
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,030
But what about her?

846
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,430
Does she like you?

847
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,010
She...

848
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,630
She doesn't like me now.

849
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,080
That's because we're not close enough.

850
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,990
When she gets to know me,

851
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,490
she will definitely–

852
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,130
You opened those pistachios

853
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,640
for her, right?

854
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,970
You're a young master after all.

855
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,830
Since when did you do such things?

856
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,840
Even a blind can tell

857
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,300
you like her.

858
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,130
Jiu,

859
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,280
you're just deceiving yourself.

860
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,970
I can't persuade you for things like love.

861
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,620
But you have to promise me

862
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,680
to inherit the position of the master.

863
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,370
But not now.

864
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,400
What do you mean?

865
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,440
Three days.

866
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,210
I'll give you three days.

867
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,530
If you can make Tian Huo fall in love with you,

868
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,380
then be prepared to welcome

869
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,810
the grandest wedding of the Fox Clan for you.

870
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,080
But if Tian Huo doesn't like you

871
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,320
no matter how hard you try,

872
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,200
that means it's not worthy for you

873
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,000
to give up on everything for her.

874
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,100
So you must then

875
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,930
inherit this position.

876
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
What do you think?

877
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,500
Do you dare?

878
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,570
Master.

879
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,010
You’ve always brought Bai Shuo along with you.

880
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,310
Why did you suddenly stop doing so?

881
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,790
Also,

882
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,960
you've been a little

883
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,820
fierce to Bai Shuo these few days.

884
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,170
Master.

885
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,290
How are you going to go in?

886
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,360
In a civilized manner

887
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
or with brute force?

888
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,800
Let’s split up.

889
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,070
I need you to do something else.

890
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,640
Master.

891
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,280
The succession concerns

892
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,050
the rise and fall of the Fox Clan.

893
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,640
After all, Mu Jiu is still young.

894
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,960
He doesn't have many achievements in the clan.

895
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,400
If you pass the position so rashly,

896
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,070
[Chang Wu, Demon Race, Elder of the Fox Clan]
[Chang Sheng, Demon Race, Elder of the Fox Clan]

897
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
wouldn't it be...

898
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,430
This position

899
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,820
is passed down within the family.

900
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,960
I have the final say of who it goes to.

901
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,590
You can be it if you want.

902
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,250
How about you go solve

903
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,570
the problem with the Emotion Tree?

904
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,770
That's not what I meant.

905
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,600
But...

906
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,700
We don't need to discuss this anymore.

907
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,450
As for Jiu,

908
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,410
Tian Huo clearly doesn't love him.

909
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,740
As long as Tian Huo can stay in the Fox Clan for three days,

910
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,730
the succession of the throne will happen naturally.

911
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,880
Chang Wu.

912
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,860
Keep an eye on them.

913
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,140
Report to me

914
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,400
if they have any movements.

915
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,290
Yes.

916
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,620
But Master,

917
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,580
the person behind Tian Huo

918
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,820
is not to be trifled with.

919
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,670
We broke into the Unbridled Pavilion.

920
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,220
If we detain her now,

921
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,330
I'm afraid...

922
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,030
What are you afraid of?

923
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,790
Even if the sky falls,

924
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,920
you'd push me

925
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,520
to take the responsibility.

926
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,220
All these years, the affairs of the Fox Clan have always been like this.

927
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,090
Now you're being loyal?

928
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,610
Master.

929
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,310
Master of Bright Moon is here.

930
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,210
Master of Bright Moon is here?

931
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:01,830
We’re doomed.

932
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,540
Are we going to be wiped out?

933
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,970
He's up to no good, right?

934
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,380
Our master is powerful too.

935
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,320
Let's go and have a look.

936
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:09,850
Okay.

937
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,590
All irrelevant people, leave.

938
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,960
I have something

939
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,490
to talk to Master Fan about.

940
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,480
Let's go.

941
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,720
Master Fan,

942
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,070
are you here for Tian Huo?

943
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,200
I'll be frank with you.

944
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,110
Lady Tian Huo is indeed in my mountain.

945
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,980
But

946
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,270
I can’t give her back to you today.

947
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,380
Why?

948
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,730
You must know that there's something going on

949
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,400
between Mu Jiu and Tian Huo.

950
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,520
My nephew is a romantic guy.

951
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,180
I promised him

952
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,600
to give him three days

953
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,180
to win the heart of Tian Huo.

954
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,190
If possible,

955
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,180
we will hold a wedding for them.

956
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Wedding?

957
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,550
You Fox Clan like to do things

958
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,880
on your own accord.

959
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,450
From the Outlanders' City's chaos,

960
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,610
you should've guessed that

961
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,610
the Cold Spring Palace's snake

962
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,500
is plotting something terrible.

963
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,610
Even if you have great demonic power,

964
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,870
it's better to have Jingyou Mountain as your friend

965
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,350
than having another enemy

966
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,780
while surrounded by other enemies, right?

967
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,580
Are you threatening me?

968
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,830
No.

969
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm asking for your help.

970
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,090
My nephew is born with weak demonic power.

971
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,550
But demons always revere the strong.

972
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,020
I fear that

973
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,210
when I'm gone,

974
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,880
he will have no one to rely on.

975
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,710
Since Mu Jiu likes Tian Huo,

976
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,650
if they can get married,

977
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,950
with the support of the Bright Moon Palace,

978
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,390
I can rest assured.

979
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,490
Consider it as me

980
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,330
owing you a favor.

981
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,490
No need.

982
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,710
Tian Huo can decide her personal matters.

983
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,880
If you want me to protect Mu Jiu,

984
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,440
that's not a problem too.

985
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,920
But I want something.

986
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
What is it?

987
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,690
The Weak Water Stone.
