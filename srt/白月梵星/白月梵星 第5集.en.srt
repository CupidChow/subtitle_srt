No.

that the Governor's Mansion has the antidote.

It seems the Nether Poison doesn't work on her.

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,900
how about we make it even more exciting?

177
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,150
Governor?

178
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,910
Screw you!

179
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,430
The governor has gone mad!

180
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,540
Governor?

181
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,790
Governor!

182
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,290
He's gone mad! Run!

183
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,000
Governor!

184
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,530
Let's run!

185
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,400
The outside is full of madmen!

186
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
Only the Governor's Mansion is safe!

187
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,830
Where else can we escape to?

188
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,280
Bai Xun is highly skilled in martial arts.

189
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,610
While he hasn't completely lost control,

190
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,600
let's kill him now!

191
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Otherwise, when he completely loses his sanity,

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,960
-we'll be the ones who die!
-Kill him!

193
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,530
They are the people Bai Xun wants to protectâ€”

194
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
ungrateful

195
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,150
and murderous.

196
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,450
Even I, a demon, can't compare to them.

197
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,520
Bai Shuo,

198
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,860
why don't you stop being a human

199
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,340
and join our Demon Race?

200
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,980
The Desireless Stone is inside you.

201
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,630
If you work for the Grand Master,

202
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,630
he

203
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,090
will surely be pleased.

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Shut up!

205
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,110
Detoxify my father!

206
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,420
As you know,

207
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,780
there's no cure for this poison.

208
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,240
It's either death or madness.

209
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,710
Today,

210
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,410
someone has to die.

211
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,110
Kill him!

212
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,530
Kill him!

213
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,270
Die!

214
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,510
Kill him!

215
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,610
Stop!

216
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,420
Stop beating him!

217
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
Beat him!

218
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,760
Beat him!

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
Father, wake up!

220
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,880
Beat him!

221
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,720
Beat him!

222
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
What are you doing?

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
Governor!

224
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop it!

225
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,260
Father!

226
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,150
No!

227
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,650
Don't bite my father!

228
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,720
Father, wake up! Father!

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
Let go of my father!

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Let go of my father!

231
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,050
Don't bite my father!

232
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,590
Let go of my father!

233
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,140
Let go of my father!

234
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,020
Go.

235
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,570
Go!

236
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,450
Father, wake up! Father!

237
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,750
Father!

238
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,550
Governor!

239
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,400
I'll kill you!

240
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,680
I swear I'll kill you!

241
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,900
I'm incompetent!

242
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,260
I can't save you.

243
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,400
This maniac condition...

244
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,690
really has no cure!

245
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,280
Bai Yu!

246
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,970
Hurry!

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Take the people out of Ning'an City!

248
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,670
Hurry!

249
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,720
Father!

250
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,320
I don't know...

251
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,290
why Ning'an is suffering this calamity,

252
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,210
but I know...

253
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,560
â™«Across thousands of milesâ™«

254
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,630
that there are gods in this world!

255
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,560
Gods!

256
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,320
I, Bai Xun,

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,250
â™«The pain of parting lingersâ™«

258
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,510
am willing to offer my life

259
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,290
to seek your mercy!

260
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:04,020
â™« I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my daysâ™«

261
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,290
Please descend upon Ning'an

262
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,550
and save

263
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,960
the people of Ning'an!

264
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,180
â™«Flowers in the wind, sand in the waterâ™«

265
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,270
I am willing

266
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,130
to exchange my life

267
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,750
for the peace...

268
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,030
Governor! Governor!

269
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,330
No!

270
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Governor!

271
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
Of a city!

272
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,510
Father!

273
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,030
â™«May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?â™«

274
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
Governor!

275
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,330
â™«Sadness from infatuation, anger, and partingâ™«

276
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,180
â™«My love brought tearsâ™«

277
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,150
â™«Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completenessâ™«

278
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,400
â™«I was never a flower, but I withered on my ownâ™«

279
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,030
â™«I fell between your brows and became a good fruitâ™«

280
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,860
â™«The grand dream of life is hard to let goâ™«

281
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,210
â™«Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothingâ™«

282
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,150
â™«With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessionsâ™«

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,050
â™«I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moonâ™«

284
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,430
â™«The daylight burns through, and the stars shine brightâ™«

285
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,320
â™«Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the skyâ™«

286
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,430
â™«I am but a mortal, destined to fadeâ™«

287
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,710
â™«But I went through a thousand calamities for a promiseâ™«

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
â™«I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and meâ™«

289
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,160
â™«To protect the world for eternityâ™«

290
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:04,100
â™«The flowers flew awayâ™«

291
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,710
â™«My tears are streaming down like rainâ™«

292
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,800
Don't sleep.

293
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:22,860
â™«Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the worldâ™«

294
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,480
You can't sleep!

295
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,610
I don't allow you to die!

296
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,670
Didn't you say you would wait with me

297
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:29,460
â™«On the vast sea, you and Iâ™«

298
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,080
for Xi to come back?

299
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,510
Xi hasn't come back yet.

300
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,150
You can't die!

301
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,240
It's all your fault!

302
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,270
It's because of you!

303
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,210
I'll kill you!

304
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,510
Father,

305
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,900
I can save you.

306
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,590
I'll find someone to save you.

307
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,630
Hang in there.

308
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,510
I will find someone to save you.

309
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,010
[Bai Residence]

310
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,800
Hang in there.

311
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,840
â™«Sadness from infatuation, anger, and partingâ™«

312

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,410
One of the Five Contemplations

327
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,580
was awakened?

328
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,520
It's golden.

329
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,990
Kindness?

330
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,950
The first Contemplation is not killing,

331
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,870
but kindness!

332

Bai Shuo.

334

Let's go.

335
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,450
Did you see that?

336
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,920
Are they immortals?

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,100
My baby is cured!

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,830
My baby is cured!

339
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,560
Sect Leader.

340
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,400
He's really cured!

341
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,370
They are really immortals!

342
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,040
They are really immortals!

343
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,140
-Are you okay? Let me see.
-I'm fine.

344
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,220
Great!

345
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,190
Great!

346
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,680
We're fine now.

347
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,560
I didn't expect to see you again.

348
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,420
Thank you, immortals! Thank you, immortals!

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,050
Thank you, immortals! Thank you, immortals!

350
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,310
Put her down!

351
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,020
The Human Race has suffered heavy losses.

352
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,970
How about we call a truce between the Eternals and demons today?

353
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,760
Bai Xun just died.

354
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,200
Aren't you going to let them

355
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,660
say their final goodbyes?

356
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,880
The Lanling Sect always stands by its word.

357
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Are you afraid

358
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,310
that we'll take her in front of you?

359
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,400
Master,

360
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,380
don't believe him.

361
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,310
You're injured.

362
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,980
We should take Bai Shuo back to the Polar Realm as soon as possible.

363
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,740
The road ahead is not yours to take.

364
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,070
Sir?

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,550
Is this the Lunar Hidden Sea?

366
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,110
Yes.

367
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,240
And no.

368
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,510
This is your sea of consciousness.

369
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,550
What you see

370
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,040
is just my consciousness.

371
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,580
Bai Shuo,

372
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,740
your father's death

373
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,460
caused you great pain.

374
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Sir,

375
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm begging you, please save my father.

376
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,130
You saved me ten years ago,

377
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,790
which was already a great kindness.

378
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,790
I know I have no right to ask for more,

379
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,210
but my father loved the city and protected the people

380
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,720
with loyalty throughout his life.

381
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,790
Until the moment of his death,

382
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,540
he never gave up on being kind.

383
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,200
He is the one who truly deserves to live.

384
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,310
Please, I beg you to save him.

385
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,000
Or...

386
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,510
or give my life to him

387
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,440
and let him live.

388
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,200
You want to die?

389
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,220
I don't want to die.

390
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,890
But I have no other choices now.

391
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,940
Only gods can bring someone

392
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,590
back to life.

393
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,960
No.

394
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,680
You're wrong.

395
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
The one who can interfere with life and death isn't meâ€”

396
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,940
it's you.

397
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,400
Me?

398
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,700
Eternals can't save him,

399
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,190
and demons can't save him.

400
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,960
I'm just a mortal.

401
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
How can I save him?

402
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,960
As long as you have enough power,

403
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
you can.

404
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Enough power?

405
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,900
How can I have enough power?

406
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,790
Gather the contemplations

407
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,790
and reignite the Desireless Stone.

408
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,820
Reignite the Desireless Stone?

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,530
Bai Shuo,

410
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,580
remember,

411
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,270
the meaning of your existence

412
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
isn't to repay someone's kindness,

413
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,360
nor to live for anyone else.

414
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,870
The Desireless Stone entering your body

415
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,070
is both a serendipity

416
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,610
and a part of the cycle of cause and effect.

417
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,080
When the heavens bestow great responsibilities,

418
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,340
they come with trials.

419
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,110
There's no way ahead.

420
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,080
No destruction, no construction.

421
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,230
You

422
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
must carve your own path.

423
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,280
What is my own path?

424
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,700
Sir,

425
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,250
who are you?

426
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,530
One day,

427
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,980
you will know.

428
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
Father.

429
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,420
Where is my father?

430
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,700
Where is my father?

Mom.

460
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,920
Ning'an City is in this state

461
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,340
because of the Eternal Race's negligence.

462
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,490
But isn't the Bright Moon Palace also responsible for this?

463
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,490
You're injured now.

464
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,650
And we're not afraid of war.

465
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,050
If the 72 sects of the Eternals unite,

466
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,450
the Bright Moon Palace would have no chance to win.

467
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,950
Do you think

468
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,290
you can use this threat on me?

469
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,140
It's not a threat.

470
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,500
If it really comes to a war,

471
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,790
it's still the common people who will suffer.

472
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,080
This is not what we want.

473
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,960
You must have taken Bai Shuo in

474
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,590
out of compassion, right?

475
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,570
Compassion?

476
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,340
Ridiculous.

477
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,440
Whether it's out of compassion or not,

478
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
only you know.

479
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,410
Whether she joins the Eternals

480
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,680
or the demons,

481
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,120
let Bai Shuo decide for herself.

482
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,720
Does it hurt?

483
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,090
Wipe it off.

484
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
Thank you, Grand Master.

485
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,290
Do you know

486
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,480
why I punished you?

487
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,330
Because I saved Chong Zhao,

488
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,330
which led to the failure of framing the blame.

489
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,470
Lanling Sect is now targeting

490
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,800
the Cold Spring Palace.

491
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,180
Wrong.

492
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,380
When you first intervened to save him,

493
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,420
I told you

494
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,410
I wouldn't punish you, so I didn't.

495
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,570
What angered me is that

496
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,600
you made the same mistake for the second time.

497
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,640
Do you think I couldn't see through it?

498
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,570
In front of

499
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,900
the Governor's Mansion,

500
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,310
you took the initiative to step in

501
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,710
and lend a hand,

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,930
and it was still to save Chong Zhao.

503
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,390
It seems our Lady Fu Ling

504
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,160
has someone special on her mind now.

505
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,230
Unfortunately,

506
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,680
he is an Eternal.

507
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,970
I can accept any punishment

508
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,250
from Grand Master.

509
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,070
But it's not your place to sow discord between us.

510
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,920
That's right.

511
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,360
But I'm also curious,

512
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,410
what exactly

513
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,760
are your feelings

514
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,110
for that Chong Zhao now?

515
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,130
I have no particular feelings for him.

516
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,090
As I said before,

517
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,700
besides repaying his kindness,

518
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,490
I also want him to join our Cold Spring Palace

519
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,820
and work for you.

520
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,880
Great.

521
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,590
Well then,

522
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,820
let's do as you said

523
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,280
and turn him into a demon.

524
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,140
How about this?

525
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,280
I...

526
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,460
will give you some more time.

527
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
One month.

528
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,640
How about one month?

529
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Within one month,

530
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,220
make him work for our Cold Spring Palace.

531
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
If you fail,

532
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,350
then

533
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,930
I'll have to step in

534
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,810
and end him.

535
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
Understood?

536
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,070
Yes.

537
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,970
Go.

538
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,190
I allowed you to kowtow to him

539
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,300
because he deserved it.

540
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,270
But Chong Zhao,

541
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,380
from now on,

542
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
you're no longer a member of the Bai family.

543
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,410
Ever since my father was chosen as the governor,

544
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,310
he prepared this coffin.

545
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,400
I know he was not afraid of death,

546
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,640
but I never imagined

547
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,700
he would leave me like this.

548
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,910
The one who always wants to cultivate immortality is me.

549
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,480
The one who was self-righteous

550
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,680
and brought the Eternals and demons upon us was me.

551
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,790
The one who should have borne the consequences was supposed to be me,

552
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,960
but why was it my father?

553
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,440
What did my father do wrong?

554
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,480
Why was he the one who died in the end?

555
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,790
Why was he the only one who died?

556
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,400
It was all my fault.

557
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,160
I failed to protect Uncle Bai.

558
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
Shuo,

559
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,880
go back to the Eternals with me.

560
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,040
Now that the Demon Race is eyeing the Desireless Stone,

561
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,150
only the Eternals can protect you.

562
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,830
That day, in the ruined house outside the city,

563
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,630
you said you'd protect my father.

564
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,720
In Ning'an City,

565
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,340
you also said that with your master and uncle master there,

566
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,240
â™«What kind of flower would never bear fruit?â™«

567
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,520
you would definitely keep my father safe.

568
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,590
The Eternals,

569
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,260
â™«What kind of fruit never sees a flower?â™«

570
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,400
the demons,

571
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,700
and the humans in this worldâ€”

572
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,070
I just realized that I never truly understood them.

573
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,120
â™«Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of meâ™«

574
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,540
I thought Eternals could always save humans,

575
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,230
â™«I am the fruit to your flowersâ™«

576
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,200
but it turned out that it was my wishful thinking.

577
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,920
I was wrong.

578
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,270
Logically,

579
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,240
I have no right to blame you.

580
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,090
But emotionally,

581
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,770
I can't help but blame you.

582
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,720
So, Chong Zhao,

583
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,960
from now on,

584
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,350
we have nothing to do

585
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,370
with each other.

â™«Across thousands of milesâ™«

587
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,610
But there's one thing

588
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,370
â™«The pain of parting lingersâ™«

589
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,590
I hope you'll tell me honestly.

590
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,110
Who cast the demonic poison in Ning'an City?

591
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,150
You want revenge?

592

â™« I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my daysâ™«

Listen to me, Shuo.

601

Don't be impulsive.

602

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,750
and I will go to the Cold Spring Palace to avenge you.

675
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,170
[Tomb of My Father, Bai Xun]

676
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,010
If you want to get revenge on the Cold Spring Palace,

677
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,400
you don't need to go through all this trouble.

678
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,860
Who allowed you to come to my father's grave?

679
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,320
Don't you want to get revenge on the Cold Spring Palace?

680
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,030
Join my Polar Realm,

681
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,150
and I'll help you.

682
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,930
The Cold Spring Palace deserves to die.

683
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,510
But what makes you any better?

684
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,840
Did you really have no intention of using me

685
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,150
when you gave me the Ghost Grass?

686
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,480
I remember you saying

687
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,610
it was an equal exchange,

688
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,550
and that gain or loss didn't matter.

689
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,880
The condition for an equal exchange was that my father was alive!

690
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,340
â™«No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless onceâ™«

691
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,980
I don't expect a demon to be good,

692
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,810
â™«Because love is thrillingâ™«

693
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,130
but I will never allow you to disturb my father's peace.

694
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
Get lost!

695
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,880
â™«If you tear open my heartâ™«

696
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,990
â™«I can hold you a little tighterâ™«

697
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,380
â™«This pain will gradually fadeâ™«

698
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,780
I do plan to leave this city.

699
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,280
However,

700
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,330
â™«Time withers the moonlightâ™«

701
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,210
you must go with me.

702
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,360
Why should I go with you?

703
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,250
â™«All that's left is pitch darknessâ™«

704
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,730
You don't have the right to choose.

705
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,310
â™«I want to tear apartâ™«

706
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,130
â™«This sky for youâ™«

707
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,120
Who says I don't?

708
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,900
â™«A lifetime of guarding everything with youâ™«

709
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,730
â™«Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vowâ™«

710
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,470
â™«I'll leap without a thought for tomorrowâ™«

711
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,370
â™«This moment feels like foreverâ™«

712
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,660
â™«I've missed too much time in my lifeâ™«

713
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,690
I told you

714
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,530
not to be disrespectful in front of my father's grave

715
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,660
â™«I'll throw myself into this flame for youâ™«

716
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,290
and disturb his peace.

717
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,030
Fan Yue,

718
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,920
â™«Even if I'll perishâ™«

719
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,440
I am just a human.

720
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,890
â™«At least I can still kiss your faceâ™«

721
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,320
In your eyes, I'm as insignificant as an ant.

722
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,100
â™«Burn out my waning moonâ™«

723
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,800
But even ants will bite

724
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,510
when cornered.

725
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,460
â™«Exchanging a lifetime of passionâ™«

726
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,280
If it weren't for your stirring things up

727
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,440
and watching from the sidelines,

728
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,300
my father wouldn't be lying here!

729
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,760
Fan Yue, remember,

730
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I, Bai Shuo, never let my grudges go,

731
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,690
nor let my anger fade on its own.

732
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,490
You never let your grudges go,

733
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,150
and never let your anger fade on its own?

734
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,110
Are you really not afraid of death just to vent your anger?

735
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,110
I am.

736
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,750
But I'm more afraid that my father can't rest in peace.

737
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,950
A heartless demon like you

738
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,910
would never understand what family means,

739
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,700
nor would you understand my father's loyalty.

740
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,670
Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!

741
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,500
Grandfather!

742
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,180
Let her go!

743
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,870
Without strength,

744
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,090
drawing your sword would only be self-humiliation.

745
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,260
Fan Yue,

746
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,870
if you forcefully take her away,

747
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,630
you'll be the enemy of the entire Lanling Sect.

748
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,360
Fine by me.

749
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,200
â™«A lifetime of guarding everything with youâ™«

750
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,810
Go back and tell Jin Yao

751
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,120
I've taken her away.

752
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,070
If he wants to start a war,

753
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,420
â™«Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vowâ™«

754
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,020
I'll be waiting in the Polar Realm.

755
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,410
â™«I'll leap without a thought for tomorrowâ™«

â™«I'll throw myself into this flame for youâ™«

â™«At least I can still kiss your faceâ™«

761
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,670
Young Lord!

762
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,110
Young Lord!

763
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,030
How are you?

764
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,180
I won't die.

765
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,160
Master hasn't punished you so harshly in a long time.

766
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,910
Young Lord,

767
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,220
I don't understand.

768
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,370
That Chong Zhao only saved you once.

769
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,110
Why are you helping him so much?

770
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,280
Haven't you already

771
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,870
repaid his kindness?

772
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,100
That's not kindness.

773
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,820
Then what is it?

774
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,620
It's a feeling,

775
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,870
a feeling

776
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,830
that I can't even explain.

777
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,810
You don't need to worry about this.

778
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,540
Investigate something for me.

779
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,760
What is it?

780
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,640
Everything about Chong Zhao from his birth until now,

781
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,100
no matter how big or small.

782
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,250
Why do you want to investigate this?

783
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,410
I want him to come into my world,

784
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,040
the world of hell.

785
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,620
[Bright Moon Palace, Demon Race]

786
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:42,620
Where am I?

787
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,280
The Bright Moon Palace.

788
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,140
I didn't say I'd come here.

789
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,620
Don't you want revenge?

790
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,300
Do you really think Lanling Sect can help you?

791
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,970
That doesn't mean

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,330
I have to rely on you.

793
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,070
Even if I don't join the Eternals,

794
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,130
I will never submit to the Demon Race.

795
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,490
I'll choose

796
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,980
my path myself.

797
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,600
No one has the right to decide for me.

798
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,050
So, are you going back

799
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,480
to Ning'an City to step right into the trap,

800
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,430
or are you going to live a wandering, fugitive life?

801
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,890
It has nothing to do with you.

802
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,620
I don't want to get involved in your life or death.

803
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,080
In my eyes,

804
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,080
you're just a vessel for the Desireless Stone.

805
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,940
But the Desireless Stone is mine,

806
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,840
so you are mine too.
