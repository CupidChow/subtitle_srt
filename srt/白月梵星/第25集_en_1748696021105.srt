1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:19,220
Welcome to the

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,220
The world is here.

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,220
We are here.

5
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:59,220
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

6
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,220
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
The fairy demon is a map.

8
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,220
You and her are not the same person.

9
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

10
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,220
You and her are not the same person.

11
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,220
You have always been sincere to me.

12
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:55,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

14
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,220
You and her are not the same person.

15
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

16
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,220
You and her are not the same person.

17
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:39,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

18
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

19
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,220
You are not the same person.

20
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,220
You are willing to be like a star, like a moon.

21
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:25,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

22
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

23
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,220
She's been suffering all these years.

24
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
She wants to be with you forever.

25
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,220
Forever?

26
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,220
If she really wants to be with you forever,

27
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,220
she should kill the mountain for me.

28
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,220
But the truth is,

29
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,220
I can't compare to you or the mountain in her heart.

30
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
What a guilt.

31
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,220
What a mountain.

32
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
It's all fake.

33
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
She's with the mountain now.

34
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,220
How could you miss such a good thing?

35
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:13,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

36
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:23,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

37
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,220
I'm willing to be like a moon.

38
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

39
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm willing to be like a star, like a moon.

40
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Wake up.

41
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
It's really a poison.

42
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
It can still wake up a little bit

43
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,220
if you control it.

44
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Come here.

45
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
I'll let my own eyes see the moon killing the mountain.

46
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Is it not interesting?

47
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Let her go.

48
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Since you don't want to kill the mountain,

49
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,220
you can kill what you love.

50
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Fan Yue,

51
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,220
throw the five-spice power out of her body.

52
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Don't.

53
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,220
I'll kill you.

54
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Kill me?

55
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Kill me?

56
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,220
I'll die if I kill you.

57
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
The magic in her body will be more powerful.

58
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
Your power will never work.

59
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
If you go to save her,

60
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
all the ten tribes will die.

61
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
I'll kill you.

62
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Fan Yue, wake up.

63
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm Bai Shuang.

64
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Ji Feng,

65
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
I'll break your legs.

66
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
They're innocent.

67
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,220
Changsheng, you want to save your tribe.

68
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,220
I'll give you a chance.

69
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
If you kill Fan Yue,

70
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,220
I'll let the ten tribes go.

71
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Don't be controlled by the evil spirits. Wake up.

72
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,220
What? You don't want to?

73
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Then I'll let you see

74
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
that they're all dead in front of you.

75
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Ji Feng!

76
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Kill Fan Yue.

77
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,220
You can save everyone.

78
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,220
I'll die.

79
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I'll die.

80
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Your hatred is over.

81
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,220
Please let go of my dad and Bai Shuang.

82
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Please let go of the ten tribes.

83
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Let go?

84
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,220
If you let go so easily,

85
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,220
why didn't anyone let go of the Bai Zezu?

86
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Let go of me?

87
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Should we just die?

88
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Fan Yue,

89
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
kill Su Zhan Su Jue.

90
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Kill him.

91
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Let go of my dad.

92
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Fan Yue,

93
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm so sorry

94
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
that I killed you.

95
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,220
I'll die.

96
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
I'll die.

97
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
You're the one who made the mistake.

98
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Cang Shan.

99
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
I'll get into the body of Cang Shan.

100
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,220
Let go of my dad!

101
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,220
I'll die.

102
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
I'll die.

103
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
You're not that easy to win.

104
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,220
I'll kill all three of them.

105
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,220
I'll die.

106
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
I can't let the ten tribes die like this.

107
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Otherwise, the blood of the Xie Chong

108
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
and Bai Zeyuan's family

109
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
will all die.

110
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220
They're all dead.

111
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Either the ten tribes die,

112
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,220
or you'll be killed by the ten tribes.

113
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,220
There's no third way.

114
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
All the grudges will have a solution.

115
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
No.

116
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
You're wrong.

117
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
The ten tribes are the most likely to die.

118
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
The third way.

119
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I'll go.

120
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Cang Shan.

121
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Cang Shan.

122
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Your Highness.

123
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
I'll take care of the dragon god.

124
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Cang Shan.

125
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Don't do anything stupid.

126
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Die Chu.

127
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
This is the best result.

128
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
I'll die with the dragon god.

129
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
These people will die soon.

130
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,220
I've left home for a long time.

131
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
The people of Dianyang and Zunran are all here.

132
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
I'll stay here.

133
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
What a pity.

134
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
I can't see the last side of the sky.

135
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
The owner is in great trouble.

136
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
He's so stubborn.

137
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
The first demon tribe.

138
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Cang Shan eats the treasure every day.

139
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
The fire is burning and the stars are with me.

140
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Cang Shan.

141
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Cang Shan.

142
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Cang Shan.

143
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Cang Shan.

144
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I'm sorry.

146
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Cang Shan.

147
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I can't believe that

148
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
the dragon god is hiding in the room.

149
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
I think the ancient scrolls

150
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
in the map

151
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
are the gods' relics.

152
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
No way.

153
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
I can't believe that

154
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
the dragon god is the weird demon

155
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
who is suspicious of the fairy and the demon.

156
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
I've never seen it before.

157
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
Fairy, demon, demon.

158
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
It's hard to find the power.

159
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
I can't believe that.

160
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
It's hard to find the power.

161
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Is it...

162
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
the hidden power?

163
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
No way.

164
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
The hidden curse has been destroyed

165
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
60,000 years ago.

166
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
How could there be hidden power?

167
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
But if there is hidden power,

168
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
there really is.

169
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Is it the hidden curse?

170
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
I've taught the hidden curse before.

171
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
It's the demon curse.

172
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
That's the hidden curse.

173
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,220
I don't know what the hidden curse is.

174
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
It's been secretly hiding in the dark.

175
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
What is it?

176
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
It's the magic and the hidden curse.

177
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
You didn't think of anything?

178
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
What? Tell me.

179
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
The hidden curse can be combined with the fairy demon.

180
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
It can be used as a relic.

181
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
It can be used as a gift to the gods.

182
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
How could it be that

183
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
the demon wants to be the god?

184
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
We can't be sure.

185
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
But we can't take this risk.

186
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,220
The 72-star sect

187
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
is coming to the Lanling ritual.

188
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Brother.

189
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Have you forgotten?

190
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
After Ning'an City was destroyed,

191
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
all the sects were worried that the war was out of control.

192
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
They thought that the human clan would not like to start the war.

193
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
No one came.

194
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
How could they dare to come to the Shisheng Clan?

195
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
If I really become a god,

196
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
the fire and the land

197
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
will be destroyed.

198
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
Who is it?

199
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Go and tell me.

200
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Yes.

201
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
Every time I think about it,

202
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I can't think of anything.

203
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Why does the hatred of Bai Zi always exist?

204
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
The fairy demon is the fairy.

205
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
The fairy demon can't be used.

206
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Uncle.

207
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
I'm here.

208
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I've always been here.

209
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Fan Yuan.

210
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
He's been trying to protect you.

211
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
You can't save him.

212
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
You can't even do anything for him.

213
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
What's the use of your demon power?

214
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
You can't save him.

215
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
You can't even do anything for him.

216
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
You can't even do anything for him.

217
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
What's the use of your demon power?

218
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
Uncle.

219
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
I can definitely think of a way to save you.

220
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
I will.

221
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
I'm not in the Shisheng Clan?

222
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Where is this?

223
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Fan Yuan.

224
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Fan Yuan.

225
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Fan Yuan.

226
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Fan Yuan.

227
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
Fan Yuan.

228
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
Bai Zi is willing to enter the world.

229
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
This is my medical field.

230
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
I'm here.

231
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Mu Zhai.

232
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Is this the place?

233
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Yes.

234
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Brother.

235
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Is this the place?

236
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Someone broke the code.

237
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Someone broke the code.

238
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Someone broke the code.

239
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
I'm not a bad person.

240
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Don't be afraid.

241
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Who are you?

242
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
How did you get in?

243
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
He is my guest.

244
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
My child.

245
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
You're finally here.

246
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

247
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Greetings, Lord Tianhui.

248
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,220
The owner of the shop has returned from the Shisheng Clan.

249
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
The owner is in Miss Bai's room.

250
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
This is...

251
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Take him down first.

252
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Be safe.

253
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Don't be afraid.

254
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
It's very safe here.

255
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
They will protect you.

256
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
By the way,

257
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
I've been to the shop all the way.

258
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,220
Why didn't I see the mountain?

259
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Where did he go?

260
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Where did it go?

261
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
That bloodyRe cut!

262
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Right in front of you.

263
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
You forgot what was inside.

264
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Maybe something lie inside the shop.

265
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
There is a mission.

266
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Who says something should be in visiting Brat?

267
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,220
Er,

268
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
I've heard burglaries.

269
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
They're mental ill.

270
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
They are just admiters of active Sad 3918,

271
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
An X zwanzhi okiefen

272
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
He had賽x dhe Dongyue

273
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
Shoshan Qiang

274
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,220
She has a snake bug on the Shizu people.

275
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Although Muchong is dead with Cangshan,

276
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
Zichong is still in the body of the Shizu people.

277
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
They are all in a coma.

278
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
Only she can push out the snake bug.

279
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
She can't die yet.

280
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Shizu, the snake bug.

281
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Or else I'll kill you right now!

282
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
It's already dead.

283
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
It's also dead in the night.

284
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Of course, I have to drag those Shizu people

285
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
to accompany me.

286
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Tianhua.

287
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Cangshan died for the Shizu people.

288
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
I mean, the Shizu people will never wake up again.

289
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,220
I promise you.

290
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,220
I will give you a chance to explain the revenge of Cangshan.

291
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Come.

292
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
How are you going to explain it to her?

293
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
I'll kill you.

294
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Or torture me?

295
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Limutan

296
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
Why did you bring me here?

297
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Maskedatic error.

298
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
What?

299
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
You think you can use these things to catch me?

300
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,220
Just let the tribe of Shi stop making mistakes.

301
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Mistakes?

302
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
What mistakes?

303
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Shouldn't they die?

304
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
The tribe of Shi is still wrong.

305
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
But the price they pay is enough.

306
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Not enough!

307
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
I'll bury them all!

308
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
What?

309
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
You don't want to pretend?

310
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
You're going to take your family's face?

311
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
The tribe of Shi won't let me go.

312
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,220
If you had the guts, you would have killed me!

313
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Kill me!

314
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
I'll avenge your funeral.

315
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,220
I'll give him the order of the Shi tribe of Wugong.

316
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,220
I'm telling you, it's not just the blood of the Shi tribe.

317
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,220
I've also personally killed the people of the Ming tribe.

318
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,220
I've never let go of all those who have been abandoned by your Shi.

319
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Why didn't you answer?

320
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Cang Shan is not your good friend.

321
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,220
I can't let you go.

322
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Anyway, they're dead in your heart!

323
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm dead too!

324
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Shi!

325
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
Cang Shan is my brother.

326
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
You are also...

327
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Shi!

328
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
Shao Ping'er,

329
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,220
the sky and the mountain are the treasure of the King of Jiyu.

330
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I'm a noble man who has done evil things.

331
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm a man who can't be a good leader.

332
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
No matter what you become,

333
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
no matter how much you hate me,

334
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
you're all my brothers.

335
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,220
I'm not just for Cang Shan,

336
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
but also for you.

337
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Shi is wrong.

338
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
They've been behind the crime,

339
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
but they've been living in fear for many years.

340
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
You?

341
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
You're also going to be behind the crime

342
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
and be killed in the end?

343
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
The A-Ye and the people are gone.

344
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
You're my only family.

345
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
If you can choose,

346
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
I'd rather be taken away by the tiger tribe.

347
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,220
I hope I can take all the things you've experienced.

348
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
If I have the courage,

349
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I can take revenge on you

350
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
and get back the anger of the past.

351
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
When I do all these things,

352
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,220
I'll give my life back to you.

353
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,220
I'll give my life back to you.

354
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,220
I'll give my life back to you.

355
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,220
I'll give my life back to you.

356
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,220
I'll give my life back to you.

357
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
But Fan Yu,

358
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
Qi Feng has died long ago.

359
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I'll give my life back to you.

360
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
I'll give my life back to you.

361
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
I'll give my life back to you.

362
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,220
I'll give my life back to you.

363
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
I'll give my life back to you.

364
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I'll give my life back to you.

365
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
I'll give my life back to you.

366
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
I'll give my life back to you.

367
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,220
I'll give my life back to you.

368
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
I'll give my life back to you.

369
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
You drank too much.

370
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,220
This is the best wine in the world.

371
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,220
I'll drink his wine for him today.

372
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
I'll drink it.

373
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,220
But there won't be another chance to drink with three people.

374
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
It's me.

375
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
I didn't protect Cang Shan.

376
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Cang Shan.

377
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
Cang Shan.

378
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
Cang Shan.

379
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Cang Shan.

380
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Cang Shan.

381
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Cang Shan.

382
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Cang Shan.

383
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Cang Shan.

384
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
If I were in the tribe

385
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
and I were in the same situation as Cang Shan,

386
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,220
I would have made the same choice as him.

387
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Cang Shan.

388
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Cang Shan.

389
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
Cang Shan.

390
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
But I want to ask you.

391
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
If there's no evil in the tribe,

392
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
would you kill Chen Yan?

393
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
I don't know.

394
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
When the tiger tribe broke into the Bai Ze tribe,

395
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
I was the one who was going to catch it.

396
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,220
My father asked Qi Feng to replace me.

397
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
If it weren't for me,

398
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Qi Feng wouldn't have been like this today.

399
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
I can't do anything about it.

400
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,220
I won't kill him.

401
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
He's my biggest threat.

402
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,220
But I want to remind you.

403
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
He's already Chen Yan.

404
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
He's not the Qi Feng he was before.

405
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,220
No matter what you do,

406
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,220
you can't change anything.

407
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,220
Maybe he's the one who's in charge of the Hall of the Hall.

408
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Whether it's to be trapped or to be released,

409
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
he can only rely on the Hall of the Hall to do so.

410
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,220
I found out two things this time.

411
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
The first one.

412
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
The one who took Bai Xi away

413
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
was from the Cold Palace.

414
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
The second one.

415
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
There was another one in the Tiger Tribe.

416
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
I learned something from him.

417
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
I think the Hall Master should also listen to it.

418
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Princess.

419
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
What?

420
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
You're still not dead?

421
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,220
You still want to find out my secret?

422
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Princess, you're mistaken.

423
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Chong Zhao has no intention of doing this.

424
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,220
I wonder what you're saying to me.

425
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
Chong Zhao.

426
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,220
You've been here for a while.

427
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Does Lan Ling really care about your life?

428
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
Chong Zhao has entered the Cold Palace.

429
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
It has nothing to do with Lan Ling.

430
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Are you really so determined

431
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,220
or are you determined to do this in front of me?

432
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Chong Zhao was forced to kill the Immortal.

433
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,220
He was already exiled to the Immortal Sect.

434
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Chong Zhao has no way out.

435
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
The Cold Palace has already taken Chong Zhao.

436
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Chong Zhao has only been in the cold for Princess.

437
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Chong Zhao, you should know that

438
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,220
I have been asking for your life many times.

439
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
You can live to this day

440
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
not by yourself,

441
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,220
but by my own will.

442
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Lan Ling has been kind and generous.

443
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,220
But she is not concerned about your safety.

444
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,220
They say that they want to protect the world.

445
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,220
But I think it's just a little bit of a threat.

446
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,220
You'll know who really cares about you in the future.

447
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Princess trusts Chong Zhao.

448
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
It's Chong Zhao's blessing.

449
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
Chong Zhao will...

450
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
You must be the strongest person around me.

451
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,220
Then you must completely cut off the Immortal Sect.

452
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,220
As long as you have the power within you,

453
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,220
you will never be able to be a real Immortal.

454
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,220
The second step is to train you

455
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,220
to merge the Immortal and Immortal sect.

456
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,220
Immortal and Immortal, how can we merge them?

457
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Don't worry. You will know soon.

458
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
Chong Zhao!

459
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
I'll punish you.

460
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,220
What can I do to help the demon inside me?

461
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Demon?

462
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,220
She wants me to kill her.

463
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Immortal Sect will only follow you to the dead.

464
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
What do you want me to do?

465
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
I want to force the demon out.

466
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I can't be the Immortal.

467
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,220
I can't be the demon that will take the Demon back to the Blue Spirit.

468
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Hurry and help me!

469
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
You...

470
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
It's useless.

471
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Seeing how strong you are,

472
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
this will be the end of the demon.

473
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,220
I can't go back anymore.

474
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,220
Chong Zhao, you should go.

475
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Go find Jin Yao. She must have a way.

476
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
No.

477
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,220
I haven't fully found out the truth.

478
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Look at you.

479
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
You're not a demon, you're not a demon.

480
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,220
Shi Zun knew you came to Leng Quan Palace to investigate the intelligence.

481
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,220
He didn't kill you. He tortured you.

482
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
I've never heard of the Immortal demon in Leng Quan Palace.

483
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,220
If you don't leave, there's no chance.

484
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
You're the one who should leave.

485
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
You've done enough for him.

486
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,220
You can leave here and live your free life.

487
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Maybe...

488
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,220
Maybe you can find your family.

489
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Family? What do you mean?

490
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Chong Zhao, how are you?

491
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
I'm not going back to the Blue Spirit.

492
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Hurry and leave!

493
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
It hurts.

494
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Leng Quan Palace is full of people.

495
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
If we can't go back,

496
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
let's face it together.

497
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
The sky is full of people.

498
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,220
I'm like a map.

499
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,220
I'm like a map.

500
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
I'm like a map.

501
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
One year.

502
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
One year.

503
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
What are you doing?

504
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
What did you ask?

505
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
What did you hit?

506
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
You're the Tiger King's aunt?

507
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
Name?

508
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
Mu.

509
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Who was the tiger king?

510
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
A demon who can be a demon.

511
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,220
That's absurd.

512
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,220
The tiger king didn't know how to be a demon.

513
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
But there were few demons who could kill the tiger.

514
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,220
How could the demon king be able to kill the tiger king?

515
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
I won't get it.

516
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Father.

517
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Father, what happened?

518
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
They came so suddenly.

519
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,220
The tiger king didn't have any protection.

520
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
I hid the letter in the box.

521
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
I escaped together.

522
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
I escaped.

523
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
I hid in the human race.

524
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
I didn't dare to step on the demon.

525
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
I...

526
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
I found me by the fire of the sky.

527
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Do you remember the demon's face?

528
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
The demon's face?

529
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
Do you remember?

530
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I saw the demon's face.

531
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,220
I saw the demon's face.

532
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
I saw the demon's face.

533
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Come.

534
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,220
What's the matter?

535
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,220
W ringing?

536
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,220
It's you who killed my father and the dragon god!

537
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
The Tiger Tribe still has a living being.

538
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
The murderer of the Tu Bai Ze is right in front of us.

539
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
You're protecting him?

540
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
He was still young.

541
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
He wasn't a murderer.

542
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Fan Yu,

543
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,220
you're really kindhearted.

544
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,220
Have you forgotten

545
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
how the old Ruo Fu Ru of the Bai Ze Clan

546
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,220
killed the Tiger Tribe?

547
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
I killed the Tiger Tribe.

548
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
I reported the revenge of the Tu Bai Ze.

549
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,220
What did you do?

550
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Now you're still pretending to be a fake?

551
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
Enough!

552
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
Isn't the murder of the Tu Bai Ze enough?

553
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
Tell me.

554
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Why did the Tiger Tribe choose Zitong?

555
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I don't know what Zitong is.

556
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,220
I just know

557
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
that there's a mysterious person

558
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
who met my father.

559
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Every time we meet,

560
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
the Tiger Tribe will have a similar image.

561
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
What mysterious person?

562
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
I've never seen his face.

563
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
I don't know who he is.

564
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
But once I saw a mysterious person

565
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,220
in the room,

566
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
I accidentally fell into his room.

567
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,220
Father!

568
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Zhu Chao,

569
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
this is my daughter.

570
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
She's still unconscious.

571
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
She's in the building.

572
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
I did see the mysterious person's face,

573
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
but I saw a black mark on her arm.

574
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
A black snake-dark mark?

575
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Do you have any idea?

576
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
I can help you.

577
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Let's go and check.

578
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
I've seen you in the memory of Qi Feng.

579
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
You're the leader of the Tu Bai Ze Tribe.

580
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,220
Do you know me?

581
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
The Tu Bai Ze is far away.

582
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,220
She's under the pressure of the Shi Tribe.

583
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
She can't communicate with anyone.

584
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
She's a secret to us.

585
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
We can only talk to you.

586
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,220
I know

587
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
that you're the Bai Shi Tribe's leader.

588
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,220
You're the one who's been in the process of the murder.

589
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,220
I know your relationship with A Yue.

590
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,220
You should call me A-ye.

591
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I've seen A-ye.

592
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,220
I'm relieved to have you by A-ye's side.

593
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Fan Yue has always missed you.

594
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
There's a secret room in the hall.

595
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
It's full of the Bai Ze Tribe's names.

596
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
She's never forgotten you.

597
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Even if it's a lost time,

598
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,220
she's always in your dreams.

599
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,220
I don't think it's better than that.

600
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
The more I can't let go,

601
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,220
the more I suffer and torture.

602
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
A Yue is like this.

603
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Qi Feng is like this too.

604
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,220
The child in Chang Shan

605
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
has to be forgiven

606
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
by her own life.

607
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,220
It's not my fault.

608
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,220
But I'm helpless.

609
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
My family and I

610
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,220
are about to be separated from the world.

611
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
I have to let you know

612
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,220
some things.

613
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,220
So I borrowed the time to take the blame

614
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,220
and brought the family to your heart.

615
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
What do you want to tell me?

616
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
A truth

617
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
that you all want to know

618
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,220
since childhood.

619
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,220
The person standing in the distance

620
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,220
Don't be afraid

621
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,220
The stars will guide you to me

622
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:07,220
Come on, come on

623
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:16,220
My heart is so excited

624
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,220
I'm so excited

625
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,220
I'm so happy

626
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,220
My heart is so cold

627
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,220
You look at me

628
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,220
You are the light I want to see

629
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,220
You are the only way

630
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,220
I can be with you

631
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:54,220
I want to be with you

632
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:01,220
I want to see you

633
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,220
You are the blue soil I want to see

634
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,220
You are the wind and the palm

635
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:17,220
I want to see you

636
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:25,220
I want to be with you

637
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I want to see you
