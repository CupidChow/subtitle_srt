1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
a

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Time is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You and him are not the same person.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Time is here.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
growing up and water

11
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,480
deeply attached to this crazy heart.

12
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,440
No.

13
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,660
It can't Marcus Sim says

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,500
to not use your heart

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,580
Out of everything

16
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,880
All you ever wish for

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
in this world

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
will get eventually

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,180
dead.

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,300
Did you expect to bury our family?

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
How about the money?

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,340
You were still in the uniform!

23
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,860
Endless fighting and reliability of family is the highlight!

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Can't let myself be fooled!

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,480
The world will be fine, but the destinyえ Docker complimentary rest

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,480
the放 obviously with you

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,460
hehe

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
zurück to 18 years

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
The spy of the internal world,

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
the family of 10,000,

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
will be watching the Star of the Moon for the first time in a year.

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Why?

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Why did master treat me like this?

34
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Why?

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Why?

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
No.

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Linglong died.

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,760
The legend is fake.

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
The immortal spirit of the Soul-Dead is gone.

40
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
It's not a nonsense.

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
It's a fairy.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
I don't see any fairy today.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Can you see her?

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Kunlun's master is sick.

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
He's going back to Kunlun.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Back to Kunlun?

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Linglong told me something strange just now.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I always think he's a little bit strange today.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I asked him what's wrong.

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
He said he was tired and wanted to rest.

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Sister.

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Where did he go?

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Awu, forgive me for being rude.

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,760
The Hu clan is rich and the Hu clan is rich.

55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
It's hard to be rich and the Hu clan is poor.

56
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm the holy woman of the Hu clan.

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Protecting the Hu clan is my responsibility.

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
But you don't understand.

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
You've been with me for three years.

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Finally you've lived a peaceful life.

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I don't want you to be in any danger.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I just want you to be a little girl who has no worries.

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
And the one who loves you.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Always live happily.

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm afraid Linglong and Rongxian will be gone in a few days.

66
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
He really treated me as Awu.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Can't we change anything?

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Linglong has a child?

69
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Let's go to the Hu clan.

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Rongxian, we're dying to pass on your power.

71
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,760
You dare to destroy the Hu clan and kill Kunlun.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Destroy the Hu clan?

73
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,760
How about this cold-blooded Kunlun?

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Rongxian, stop!

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Stop!

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Kunlun is wrong.

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
But what's to be done is to kill Kunlun and his four demons.

78
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I didn't hurt you.

79
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm not the one who should be killed.

80
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Then I'll ask you.

81
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
What's wrong with Linglong and the child?

82
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Rongxian.

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
If you continue to kill them, you can't go back to your head.

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Go back?

85
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I've already done everything I can.

86
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I've always killed my own people.

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I've done everything I can.

88
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,760
I'll let the famous Kunlun, Wei Linglong and the child, be with me.

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
But the one who should die will die.

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
I'll go back to my head.

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
No!

92
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Is this child...

93
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Is it...

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Is it...

95
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Sister!

96
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Sister!

97
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Sister!

98
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Sister!

99
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
We're still here.

100
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Who's the one who killed Hu Zu?

101
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Awu.

102
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
You're alive.

103
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
You're so good.

104
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
It's Rongxian.

105
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Rongxian killed Hu Zu.

106
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,760
All of this was done by Kunlun.

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Why?

108
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Isn't Rongxian the Fairy?

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Isn't Kunlun the one who protected the Cangsheng?

110
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Lingling is the one who killed Hu Zu.

111
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Why would she still hate the niece?

112
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
She gave birth to such a wish?

113
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
A wish?

114
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Yes.

115
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
This is a wish.

116
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Since everything is fake,

117
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
can we turn back to life or death?

118
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
If we save Linglong and the child,

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
will there be a chance to change?

120
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Linglong is dead.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
She won't live.

122
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
You only said she won't live.

123
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
So, can the child be saved?

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
This child has almost saved Linglong and all the spiritual gifts.

125
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
There's still a chance to save her.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
But this is just a illusion.

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
They've been killed by Rongxian.

128
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Even if we change our lives and save her,

129
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
what's the point?

130
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
No.

131
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
If everything that happened

132
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
is really what Rongxian wanted,

133
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
then why would she still have such a strong wish

134
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
and such a deep wish?

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,760
You asked me what kind of person Rongxian is.

136
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I can see that she's not fake.

137
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Since we've heard the truth a thousand years later,

138
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,760
it's not true that what we see now is not true.

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
If the Hu tribe killed Kunlun,

140
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
then who is the one who really killed Kunlun?

141
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Fengyuan,

142
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
saving this child

143
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
may have a chance to change.

144
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
You really want to save this child?

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
You are so cruel!

146
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
I just want to save this child.

147
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
What kind of child is this?

148
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I don't know.

149
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
But I can't help it.

150
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I just want to save this child.

151
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You really want to save this child?

152
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I don't.

153
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
I just want to save this child.

154
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I don't want to be a burden to this child.

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I don't want to be a burden to this child.

156
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
You are so cruel to the Hu tribe.

157
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
That's why you are so cruel.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
When Linglong died,

159
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,760
you used blood to ruin her memory.

160
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
That's what happened.

161
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Rongxian, look!

162
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
This is your child.

163
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
She's not...

164
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
She's not dead.

165
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
It's me.

166
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
You killed your own daughter!

167
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
She's gone crazy.

168
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
You said nothing.

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Trust me.

170
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
No.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
The child is still here.

172
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Look.

173
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
She's going to cry.

174
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
She'll laugh.

175
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
She's warm and breathless.

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
She's a little fat.

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
She's soft and soft like a little group.

178
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
You haven't seen her.

179
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,760
You haven't hugged her yet.

180
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
From the beginning,

181
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
I knew that this child was not good.

182
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
It's hard to live.

183
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
But she still wants to give up everything to protect her.

184
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
Because she loves this child and loves you.

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Rong'er,

186
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
I know that Hu Zu is your family.

187
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
When there's a doctor,

188
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
the fairy demon is no longer fighting.

189
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
When they can take us,

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I will take you to Hu Zu.

191
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,760
There's no doubt that there's only hatred between the fairy demon and you.

192
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Our love and love are not wrong.

193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,760
No matter if Kunlun and Hu Zu take us or not,

194
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I, you,

195
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
and our future child

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
are all true and true.

197
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
The world is too big.

198
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I've already experienced two kinds of fighting.

199
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,760
What I want is a warm home.

200
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,760
You think you've been in a bad mood,

201
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
and you've hit Kunlun's算計.

202
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
You think you're the worst.

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
So you hate yourself the most.

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
You're actually the one, right?

205
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Do I know?

206
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Why would I be Kunlun's son?

207
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Why must the fairy demon be killed by Fang Xiu?

208
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Why is such a cruel thing

209
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
happening to me and Ling Long?

210
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,760
There are many things that I can't ask for.

211
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,760
I've also been in a bad situation.

212
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,760
I've also been in a bad situation.

213
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Why was I saved by the gods?

214
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Why is my sister not the one who did it?

215
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Why is my father not the one who died?

216
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
But no one can give me an answer.

217
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Maybe most people in the world are all suffering.

218
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Everyone has their own difficulties.

219
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
But they must find a way for themselves.

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
If my path continues,

221
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,760
I'll let go of your path.

222
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
You're like your mother.

223
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
You don't follow me.

224
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
You're good.

225
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
My child.

226
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm looking forward to this.

227
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Let's go find your mother.

228
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Okay?

229
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
This is Miss Yue Ning.

230
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
We're going out.

231
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Cang Shan.

232
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Cang Shan.

233
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Why is it moving?

234
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
What's wrong?

235
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Uncle!

236
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
What's wrong?

237
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
What's wrong?

238
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Uncle, are you okay?

239
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
What happened?

240
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm fine.

241
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
We entered the fairy's realm.

242
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
We changed some things in the realm.

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,760
It's been a long time since we last met.

244
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
He was so cruel to us.

245
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
He was punished for his own sins.

246
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
But he's also so selfish.

247
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I hope someone can help him.

248
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Fengyu, thank you.

249
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
You saved the child and the fairy.

250
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
He saved the child himself.

251
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
He can't forgive himself.

252
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
So he's been so cruel for a thousand years.

253
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Even if all the tragedy has been over,

254
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
he can't change it.

255
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
But he still hopes that someone can help him

256
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
change the child's fate.

257
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Only then can he have the chance to change his fate.

258
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
He chose us.

259
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Rong Xian has been so cruel for a thousand years.

260
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Now he can finally let go.

261
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
No, they're going through the road.

262
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I want to know.

264
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
I'll go ask.

265
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Let me take care of him.

266
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:23,860
Go.

267
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,960
Huffman.

268
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
She really is Aницыu.

269
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
It's Aницыu.

270
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
She's appeared.

271
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
It's A � estate.

272
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
She really is A kill.

273
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,080
What?

274
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,560
Mujiu, take it.

275
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Senior!

276
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,960
This is Senior's choice.

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,760
He also hopes we can let go of our hatred.

278
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Otherwise, we won't be able to exchange our identities with you in the court.

279
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
The new fire turtle is so lucky.

280
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
There's no doubt about Kunlun.

281
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
No!

282
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Everyone has their own fate.

283
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Why give it to him?

284
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
That's right!

285
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Why give it to him?

286
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
It's just that a person who has died for a thousand years

287
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
has no right to decide who to give it to.

288
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
That's right!

289
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
That's enough!

290
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
I didn't care about you.

291
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I saw you two fighting for a long time.

292
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Now, I can't lie to you.

293
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Let me tell you.

294
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
If anyone dares to fight with me,

295
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
I'll be the enemy of the Jinyou Mountain.

296
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
It's Changmei!

297
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Changmei has been killed by three kings.

298
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
He's broken his arm.

299
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
It's not easy to get him to fight.

300
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
You're afraid of Changmei?

301
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm not afraid of him being eliminated.

302
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Kid,

303
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
hand over the second fire.

304
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
You saw it too.

305
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
You can't hold the fire for a long time.

306
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Why don't you hand over the second fire?

307
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Why should I give it to you?

308
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
But this sister

309
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
saved me in the chaos just now.

310
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
If you want it,

311
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I can consider it.

312
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Him?

313
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
No.

314
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
When you and Rongxian were fighting,

315
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
you clearly used your power.

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
You're not a demon.

317
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
You're a artist.

318
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Artist?

319
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Artist?

320
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
What do I have to do with you?

321
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
How can you be a soldier in the Hall of Fame?

322
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
How can you be related to us?

323
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
That's right.

324
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
That's right.

325
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
You're a soldier.

326
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Kid,

327
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
we've already let you lead the team.

328
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Right?

329
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
You're colluding with the artist now.

330
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
That's not the point of the world.

331
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Right?

332
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
That's right.

333
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
The fire has been burning for seven years.

334
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
It's been a long time.

335
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Now it's a demon.

336
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
It's a demon.

337
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Why can't we be a demon?

338
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
We can change the technique.

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
We can change the bloodline.

340
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
He's just an artist.

341
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Right.

342
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
That's right.

343
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Kid,

344
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
you're a...

345
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Zishu Jing,

346
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
you can't steal the new fire.

347
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
You're really against others.

348
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
You're a second brother.

349
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
You're a demon.

350
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I think you're a demon.

351
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Don't be face.

352
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
You're so selfish.

353
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
What are you talking about?

354
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Come here.

355
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Come here.

356
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
What's wrong?

357
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
What's wrong?

358
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
What's wrong?

359
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Stop!

360
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Stop!

361
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Stop!

362
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Stop!

363
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Stop!

364
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
The fire is in his hands.

365
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You're not chasing him.

366
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't let him run away.

367
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Stop!

368
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Stop!

369
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Stop!

370
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Stop!

371
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Stop!

372
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Stop!

373
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Stop!

374
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Stop!

375
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Stop!

376
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
What a bunch of idiots.

377
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
They want to be a demon.

378
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
The famous demon king of the demon clan,

379
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
is just an artist.

380
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Interesting.

381
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Why can't we steal the new fire

382
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
from the dragon?

383
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Master.

384
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Master.

385
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Wu An.

386
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I was just a little injured.

387
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I didn't steal the fire.

388
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
The third fire is in the first place.

389
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
If both of them are in our hands,

390
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
we'll be more important.

391
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Master.

392
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
What happened in the forest?

393
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Why are you so upset?

394
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Nothing.

395
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
I just had a bad day in the forest.

396
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I've lost some magic power.

397
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Lost some magic power?

398
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Even if you have a bad day in the forest,

399
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
you'll be severely injured and killed.

400
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
You're so clear-headed.

401
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Master.

402
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
You have a seven-star fire.

403
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Why are you so upset?

404
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
You're a demon.

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Is it all for the sake of saving Bai Shuo?

406
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I was just trying to save the forest.

407
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
How could I save Bai Shuo?

408
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Bai Shuo knows that.

409
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Master, to break the fairy's spirit,

410
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
the spirit power is so strong.

411
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
She doesn't know.

412
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Don't mention it to her again.

413
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Yes.

414
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Yes.

415
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Senior, you called me?

416
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower can't be transmitted.

417
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
You go outside the city.

418
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Use the spirit power to

419
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
send the message to the city.

420
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
The message?

421
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Why so sudden?

422
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

423
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
can't be transmitted to the city

424
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy.

425
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
It can be transmitted to the city

426
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
or the fire.

427
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm afraid that

428
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
the five-star fire is not that simple.

429
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Go back quickly.

430
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't let others find out.

431
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

432
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
can't be transmitted to the city

433
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy.

434
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

435
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
can't be transmitted to the city

436
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy.

437
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

438
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
can't be transmitted to the city

439
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy.

440
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

441
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
can't be transmitted to the city

442
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy.

443
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

444
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
can't be transmitted to the city

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
No matter it's a monster or a fairy.

446
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
The Yicheng Sword-Tower

447
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
can't be transmitted to the city

448
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
no matter it's a monster or a fairy

449
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
I'm afraid that

450
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
it will single out a monster

451
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
in order toicide the city.

452
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,460
üs

453
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
the sake and notoriety

454
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
threatened the sky

455
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
if the Dean let you enter the West

456
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,560
three times during the fire

457
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
it cannot ever get past

458
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
這個人沒有想到

459
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I have no reason to comment

460
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
now that I have the chance

461
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
I was so confident in my mother.

462
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I have left a thousand year of my wish.

463
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
I have no one to break it.

464
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,160
Fan Yue and Bai Shu

465
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,160
thought they would break the wish of the immortal.

466
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,760
I don't know.

467
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
But they have done it for us.

468
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Has the operation on the Fulin started?

469
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
It should be done soon.

470
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
There are two days left until the late night of Fen'an.

471
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
As long as the Immortal Demon is in the palace,

472
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,560
it will be a misunderstanding.

473
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
The red-eyed night, the immortal.

474
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
I will send her to the biggest funeral.

475
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Master.

476
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Master.

477
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Master.

478
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
How could this happen?

479
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
You are so naive.

480
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
It's a small matter.

481
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I'm afraid the Immortal Demon is not here.

482
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Bai Shu and Noble Lady have learned some medical skills.

483
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Go find her.

484
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Okay.

485
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Master.

486
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
The demon has come.

487
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
The Immortal Demon is hurt.

488
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
What's wrong with her?

489
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
When did she get hurt?

490
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
You don't even know when she got hurt.

491
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
The Immortal Demon has been trying to kill the child.

492
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't know how much she has lost.

493
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
How dare you...

494
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Cang Shan.

495
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
What is this?

496
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
The second piece of the Guanyuan Pill.

497
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Don't be greedy.

498
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
If you don't believe me,

499
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
then just watch her die.

500
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I will.

501
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
It's really a small pill.

502
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
It's not enough for just one pill.

503
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
We still need to take the medicine.

504
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
You guys go to the city to find the medicine.

505
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Miao Fang.

506
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Something bad has happened to them.

507
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
XieENT-Yue.

508
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
He is dead,

509
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
but the pretext is not over yet.

510
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
How are you talking about this?

511
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
You must be tired.

512
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Are you worried?

513
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
I mean...

514
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
uppess there.

515
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
But

516
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
everything is cycle.

517
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Yan Yujia?

518
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:48,680
Her Darwin име

519
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,080
It seems no emission is necessary to see if the animals are stupid

520
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:54,920
The

521
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
He's not in the room.

522
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,920
Master.

523
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,220
Where did he go?

524
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,420
He was injured and weak.

525
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,920
He was going out to take me with him.

526
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,420
No one else is involved.

527
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,920
Master left the room by himself.

528
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,420
Find him separately.

529
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Let's go.

530
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Let's go.

531
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Come on.

532
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Sit here.

533
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,920
Okay.

534
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Sit here.

535
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
Okay.

536
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Come on.

537
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Look.

538
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
Look.

539
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Thank you.

540
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Here.

541
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Be careful.

542
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Sorry, Miss.

543
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I saved you from the police station.

544
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,420
I didn't do it to make you get killed.

545
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Why didn't you hide?

546
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Why did he keep an eye on me?

547
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,920
Did he scold me?

548
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Are you angry?

549
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,920
Since you're fine,

550
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
I'll go back first.

551
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
Does it hurt?

552
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
You're not Fan Yuan.

553
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Who are you?

554
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,420
You really don't remember your name?

555
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
I don't remember.

556
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I don't remember.

557
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
I don't remember.

558
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,420
Where's Hao Yue?

559
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
The Demon King?

560
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
The Sky Fire?

561
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
You always remember when you miss him, right?

562
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
What do you remember?

563
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
You...

564
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
You...

565
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
Who do you remember me?

566
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
The one who was good to me.

567
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
What's going on?

568
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
The last time I was in the hospital,

569
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
it was Gu Yuan Dan.

570
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
That's right.

571
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Is it because he was injured in the hospital

572
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
and had a different wound?

573
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
He had a bad time.

574
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
No.

575
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,420
I can't let the Sky Fire and the Demon King

576
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,920
know that I killed Fan Yuan.

577
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Otherwise, they'll have to criticize me.

578
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Listen.

579
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,920
You're Fan Yuan.

580
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,420
The Demon King of the Jiyu.

581
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,920
The owner of Hao Yue.

582
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920
You have the Sky Fire and the Demon King.

583
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,420
Your name is unheard of in the world.

584
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Your home is in Hao Yue.

585
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
You made a lot of money.

586
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
It's very, very luxurious.

587
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Just like the clothes you have.

588
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
And we are now in Yicheng.

589
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
We are here to open the Five Nights.

590
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
The whole Yicheng has been changed.

591
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,420
It's just that we didn't see the owner.

592
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
He probably hasn't come back.

593
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Dear guests.

594
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
Your owner has already come back.

595
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
I saw that girl in the human clan

596
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
going to the building.

597
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
My name is Bai Shuang.

598
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I'm your...

599
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
lover.

600
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I was just saying that too quickly.

601
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
I'm just repeating...

602
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Bai Shuang.

603
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
I remember.

604
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,920
So you promised to protect me.

605
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Are you still counting?

606
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Counting?

607
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Don't turn back, Demon King.

608
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
I won't.

609
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Why do you trust me so much?

610
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
When you saved me,

611
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I was the only one who was worried.

612
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Although I don't know who you are,

613
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
you must be the closest person to me.

614
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
So I trust you.

615
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Bai Shuang.

616
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Master!

617
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Master!

618
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
You...

619
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Oh no.

620
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I haven't finished telling you.

621
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Fengyuan is already missing.

622
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
She doesn't remember them at all.

623
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
She must be there.

624
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Bai Shuang.

625
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
How dare you say that we are not here.

626
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Gu Yuheng is our master.

627
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I am...

628
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.

629
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
What's wrong?

630
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Nothing.

631
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
You can leave now.

632
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Since Master is not here,

633
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
we should leave now.

634
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Close the door.

635
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Close the door.

636
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,920
They are both

637
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,420
the Fire and the Mountain.

638
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
You don't want to see them?

639
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Why do you think so?

640
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Because when they came in,

641
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
there was a light in your eyes.

642
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
It seems that they lost their will.

643
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
They didn't change their mind.

644
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,920
They are still smart.

645
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Remember,

646
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Yi Cheng is very dangerous.

647
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,420
You must not let anyone

648
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,920
find out the truth.

649
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Including them.

650
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
How about this?

651
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I'll teach you.

652
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
You should remember seven words.

653
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
The body.

654
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
The short words.

655
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
The eyes.

656
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
When you talk to someone,

657
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
you should call yourself

658
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
the father.

659
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
The father.

660
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Once again.

661
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
The power.

662
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Stop.

663
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Put your hand here.

664
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
Put your hand here.

665
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Put your hand here.

666
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Do you think the owner is very rude?

667
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Very rude?

668
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,420
Bai Shuo slept in our owner's room for a night.

669
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Is it possible

670
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,920
that he gave the owner the medicine?

671
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
What did you say?

672
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Who slept in Fan Yue's room for a night?

673
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
The power.

674
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Yes.

675
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
That's it.

676
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
The expression is more cold.

677
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
The spirit is more proud.

678
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
The eyes are more powerful.

679
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Hall Master, please be careful.

680
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
I...

681
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
You dare to touch the power?

682
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
It's not what you think.

683
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
A Shuo is the person in the power.

684
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
I think that

685
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
I can do whatever I want.

686
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
What do you want?

687
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Let her go.

688
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Zheng, you...

689
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,420
I only listen to A Shuo.

690
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I don't care what she says.

691
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
She said it.

692
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
Fang Yue,

693
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
let go of my hand.

694
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
It's too late.

695
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,420
Let her go.

696
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Come out with me.

697
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
Hall Master.

698
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
Go out.

699
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
Yes.

700
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Close the door.

701
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
It's not what you think.

702
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
Fang Yue was hurt in order to save someone.

703
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
She was so scared.

704
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
She was so scared.

705
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
She was so scared.

706
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,920
I took care of her all night

707
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
in order to save someone.

708
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Save someone?

709
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
She is a demon.

710
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
She can save people?

711
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
She is not what you think.

712
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
But she just...

713
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
A Shuo,

714
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
when did you become so close to each other?

715
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Fang Yue doesn't remember anything now.

716
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
No one can kill her.

717
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
I can't let anyone know that she is lost.

718
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Close?

719
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
I just don't want to owe her any favors.

720
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
You are trying to break the rules of the world.

721
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
Have you ever thought about leaving this dance?

722
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
It's not the only chance.

723
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
If you are in the first place,

724
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,420
you will have no future.

725
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,420
I don't want to wait for the revenge and revenge.

726
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Even if it's a thousand-point cliff ahead,

727
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
I plan to jump.

728
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
If it's a broken bone,

729
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
will you jump too?

730
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
From the story of the past,

731
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,920
the ending of jumping

732
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,420
will probably be a miracle.

733
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,420
You will get the God's Ice

734
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,920
and the Blood of the Blood.

735
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Then you will come back to the Great Sha Temple

736
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
to get the wish of the city.

737
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Chong Zhang,

738
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
you should also wish me the same.

739
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Wish me that I will not die

740
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
and wish to get the city.

741
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
You must stay.

742
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
You must stay.

743
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
I understand.

744
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,420
So what can I do for you?

745
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
What have you done to the owner?

746
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
I knew that

747
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
hiding the mountain is easy.

748
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
It's hard to hide it from you.

749
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Shiyi,

750
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,420
a lover.

751
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
When the owner recovers his memory,

752
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
he knows that you are so confident.

753
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
You are so confident.

754
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Don't threaten me.

755
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Your owner only trusts me now.

756
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
If I am not happy,

757
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
I will feed him a bone every day.

758
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I think he trusts me as a lover

759
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
or as your partner.

760
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
How dare you!

761
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Why would I dare not?

762
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Being a lover is too much.

763
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
If you still want to take five years,

764
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
let the owner wake up.

765
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Do you think I don't want to?

766
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,920
He is in a state of depression now.

767
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
He needs time to recover.

768
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I will take care of him.

769
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,420
He needs time to recover.

770
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
How long?

771
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
A couple of days.

772
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,420
How about Changze?

773
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,420
I don't know.

774
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
You are like this.

775
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,420
You should not do it on purpose.

776
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,420
I am the same as Fan Yue.

777
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,420
We are still the same at this moment.

778
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
I won't do it on purpose.

779
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
You think he is the same?

780
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
What else?

781
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,920
You are the best.

782
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Revenge?

783
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Tian Huo and Cang Shan secretly searched the ingredients in the city.

784
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
They are all the medicines for the cure.

785
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,920
They are so anxious to get rid of Fan Yue.

786
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Is he injured in the Dragon Immortal's courtyard?

787
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
So,

788
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Tian Huo is not with Fan Yue now.

789
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Yes.

790
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
I told you.

791
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
I will talk to my son.

792
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
We will see if he is heard out.

793
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Let me tell you this.

794
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Don't talk like that to him.

795
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Do you think he is a naive lad?

796
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Do you think he can do anything?

797
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,920
Seriously?

798
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,420
Don't ask for anything.

799
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,420
I'm so angry.

800
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
I was afraid of A Zhao.

801
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
I found you lost your memory.

802
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
So...

803
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
You called her A Zhao, but you called me Fan Ru.

804
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
This is for you.

805
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Mu Mu.

806
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Actually, I usually call you Mu Mu.

807
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Because your name is Mu.

808
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
But you are the Demon King.

809
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
So you can't call this name in front of outsiders.

810
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm not a demon.

811
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
You can't call this name in front of outsiders.

812
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Mu Mu.

813
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
He Ya.

814
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
Mu Mu.

815
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
You are so good.

816
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Have a good rest.

817
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,420
Go to bed early.

818
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Where are you going?

819
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
To the room.

820
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,420
There is a bed here.

821
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Together.

822
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,420
We can't sleep together.

823
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
Why?

824
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
Look.

825
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,420
In the inn, everyone is a beautiful room.

826
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
What is this for?

827
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,420
It's for the sake of the space for each other.

828
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
We are lovers.

829
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,420
Why do we have to be lovers?

830
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Love.

831
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,420
There is also a need for each other to have space.

832
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
Will lovers be together?

833
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
No.

834
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,420
They will be beautiful together.

835
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
But I think...

836
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,420
No.

837
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
You don't want to.

838
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
You have so many trust in me.

839
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,420
I'm afraid that I will have too much trouble when you recover.

840
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
The Demon King is the Demon King.

841
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
It's better to keep a distance.

842
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Good boy.

843
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Go to bed.

844
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
Be careful.

845
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Go.

846
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
Hua Ling sent you here.

847
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,420
Queen, the Hall of the Moon must die in the first place.

848
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
I want to die.

849
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Get out.

850
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Retreat.

851
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,420
The Demon King is not finished.

852
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,420
We will withdraw.

853
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
General, you have a order.

854
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
You can't kill the Queen.

855
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
Wait for me.

856
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,420
Do you know that you may die?

857
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
I'm fine.

858
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
I have to protect you.

859
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
I remember this.

860
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,420
I said it casually.

861
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
You can't remember anything else.

862
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,420
You only remember this.

863
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
You don't need to remember.

864
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
Because I want to protect you.

865
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
Because I want to protect you.

866
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
You can't lose your life even if you want to protect me.

867
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Next time you meet this kind of situation,

868
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
you must protect yourself first.

869
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Don't worry about me.

870
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Did you hear that?

871
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm asking you a question.

872
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
Did you hear that?

873
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
Hand.

874
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
You still feed her?

875
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
If you...

876
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
If you are sleepy after eating,

877
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
you can sleep after you are sleepy.

878
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Don't wait for me.

879
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I have something to talk with Tian Huo.

880
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,420
Tian Huo,

881
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,420
I didn't want to ask you about your life.

882
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
But now, a monster is chasing after you.

883
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,420
It's time to kill him.

884
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,420
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,420
The monster is chasing after you.

886
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,420
It's time to kill him.

887
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
It's time to kill him.

888
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
It's time to kill him.

889
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
It's time to kill him.

890
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,420
We must find a way to break the barrier.

891
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,420
I hope you can tell me everything you know.

892
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,420
Including your past.

893
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:36,420
My heart is so excited.

894
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,420
Wait for me.

895
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,420
I'm so happy to see you.

896
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,420
You are the light I want to see.

897
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,420
It's the lonely way.

898
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Let this moment be with you.

899
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:10,420
I want to be with you.

900
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:17,420
I can't forget you.

901
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,420
You are the blue soil of my life.

902
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,420
I'm so happy to see you.

903
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,420
I'm so happy to see you.

904
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:42,420
I want to be with you.

905
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm so happy to see you.
