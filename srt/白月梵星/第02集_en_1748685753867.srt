4

Everything that has happened has happened.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,260
It's time to put an end to it.

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,740

I want to be with you forever.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
You and him are not the same person.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
You are the same person.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
You and him are not the same person.

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You are the same person.

You are the same person.

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,960
You are the same person.

Life is clear.

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Life is true.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
We are together.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
We are together.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
We are together.

First Episode

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Episode 17

24
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
The monster is watching the star of the moon.

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
The style of this snake-eating snake,

26
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,660
this wild composition,

27
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
is really the fairy.

28
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
We still need to find out.

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,860
Miss Bai said she would come again.

30
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,360
I thought she would be late.

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,860
I didn't expect her to be so anxious.

32
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,360
I didn't expect either.

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
She was so calm.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
The master put my words on her mind.

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
You said last night that you are very good at playing the game.

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
You can make me do anything.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
If that's the case...

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Wait.

39
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,460
Last night was last night.

40
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,760
Today is today.

41
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I was in a hurry to talk to the master.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Since I have a good relationship with the master,

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I should get to know him.

44
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
There is a kind of a popular wine in Ni'an City.

45
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
A cup of wine, a question.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
I drink, you answer.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Do you feel it?

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:32,940
When I was который of previous했

49
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,940
I've been in the game for years.

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
Although I've not been able to get the first number,

51
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,940
I'm still a little bit of a fan.

52
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Now that I've tried, I'm not that bad.

53
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Since you have such a big name,

54
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,940
it's not too much to look at.

55
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,940
I'm going to deal with those numbers.

56
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
What do you mean?

57
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
You naturally have different lives.

58
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,940
It's me who's going to deal with them.

59
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm going to deal with them.

60
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm going to deal with them.

61
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
It's me who's going to deal with them.

62
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm going to deal with them.

63
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm going to deal with them.

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,940
If I'm being too rash,

65
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
I'll be a sinner.

66
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,940
What do you want to see?

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,940
The wind, rain, lightning, lightning,

68
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,940
are these too hard for you?

69
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

70
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
The demon is not in the game.

71
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
There's a big demon in the city.

72
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Why is it raining suddenly?

73
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Where are you going again?

74
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Where are you going?

75
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Miss Bai, what are you still looking at?

76
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
The fire is still in the city.

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
As long as you're awake,

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,940
I'll show you everything.

79
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Enough, enough.

80
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,940
The fairy is in the fairy's power.

81
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Come to the play.

82
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Then the third cup of wine...

83
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Miss Bai asked so many questions.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
It's time to turn to me.

85
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,940
What are you doing?

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
She really can.

87
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Don't move.

88
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
What is she doing?

89
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Is she testing my magnetism?

90
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
It's strange.

91
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Why can she make the five-seller seven reflect?

92
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,940
But she can't turn on the five-seller.

93
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Is it because she's too weak?

94
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
It turns out that this is a demon nest.

95
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Go.

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Which fairy will do this?

97
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
Miss Bai, don't worry.

98
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,940
This is the magic trick of the Blue Forest Sect.

99
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
If you don't want to learn, just forget it.

100
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,940
You think I'm stupid?

101
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
I've never heard of a fairy with a thousand words.

102
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
I need to use ten words.

103
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm not a fairy.

104
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm a demon.

105
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm not a fairy.

106
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm a demon.

107
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I've never heard of a fairy with a thousand words.

108
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
I need to use ten words to turn on people.

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
What fairy?

110
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
I think you're more like a demon.

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
There's no need to be a demon in the world.

112
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
You don't know.

113
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
You can only explain it without knowing.

114
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
Miss Bai, I've only asked you to do it.

115
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
That's why I'm doing it.

116
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,940
If you don't want to, just leave.

117
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I have no idea what you are doing.

118
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
What?

119
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
You didn't want to know?

120
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I just wanted to know.

121
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
You're not a demon.

122
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm a demon.

123
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm not a demon.

124
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm not a demon.

125
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
I'm a demon.

126
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
I'm a demon.

127
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
I'm a demon.

128
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm a demon.

129
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm a demon.

130
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm a demon.

131
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,940
I'm a demon.

132
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I'm a demon.

133
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm a demon.

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
And I'm a demon.

135
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
I'm a demon.

136
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm a demon.

137
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm not this person.

138
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
I'm a demon.

139
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,940
I'm not this person.

140
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,940
This person is a demon.

141
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
I'm so proud of you.

142
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,940
I know you know that I'm a demon.

143
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
I'm a demon.

144
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
This is...

145
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,940
I'm Chong Zhao.

146
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Bai Shuai is the fiancee who is engaged to Bai Shuai.

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
That's so interesting.

148
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Such a different couple has a marriage.

149
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Could it be that Miss Bai is a special person?

150
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Bai Shuai is just my fiancee.

151
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,940
I don't have a special identity.

152
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
My elder brother-in-law knows that we are here today.

153
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
He is not worried.

154
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
No matter what the future holds,

155
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,940
we will not be in a hurry.

156
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
You are right.

157
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
We are here to help you.

158
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,940
But we need to be serious.

159
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
If you come again,

160
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
please tell us in advance.

161
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
So that we can have a peaceful marriage.

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Okay.

163
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Zhao, what are you talking about?

164
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Let's go back first.

165
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
No.

166
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Miss Rong,

167
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
our master is having a feast at home tonight.

168
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
He wants you to celebrate his birthday.

169
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Zhao,

170
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
why are you so angry?

171
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
This place is not a hotel. Let's go back first.

172
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm here to do something serious.

173
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Why are you here?

174
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
Let Bai Shuai know that he is going to be angry.

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Let's go back.

176
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
I'm here to do something serious.

177
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Why are you here?

178
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Let Bai Shuai know that he is going to be angry.

179
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Let's go back.

180
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Let's go back.

181
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm sorry. Let's go back.

182
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
No.

183
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Young man,

184
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
come to see me dance.

185
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,940
You went to the city to talk business.

186
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
Why did you go to the chicken house?

187
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Do you know that old master?

188
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
No.

189
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
I don't know him.

190
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
But I saw you talking to him.

191
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
He is a man of the art.

192
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,940
Then what are you doing in the chicken house?

193
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
I'm just doing my job.

194
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
He said that the master is a fairy.

195
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Fairy?

196
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
You believe him?

197
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I didn't believe him.

198
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
But he has a little bit of a headache today.

199
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
Uncle,

200
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,940
that chicken house is not a good place.

201
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
I know you want to beg for a fairy.

202
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
But they are all frauds.

203
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
Don't be fooled by them.

204
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
You always have a good relationship with people.

205
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
Why do you feel sorry for the chicken house?

206
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Or do you know something?

207
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
I...

208
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
I'm just afraid that you will be cheated.

209
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Just like that?

210
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Yes.

211
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Are you hiding something from me?

212
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
No.

213
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
That's good.

214
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,940
You know it.

215
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
I don't like to be cheated.

216
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,940
There is a mansion in front.

217
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
You should go back.

218
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
I have some things to do in the warehouse.

219
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
I will come back later.

220
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
What?

221
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Why is Zhou Qing strange today?

222
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
That Fan Yue looks like a fairy.

223
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
I have to find Master Song to ask him.

224
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Master,

225
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
why did we let that fairy run away?

226
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
If she is the fairy who sent the demon into Ning'an City,

227
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
and goes back to Lanling,

228
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
we can't continue the building.

229
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,940
I don't think that a fairy in Lanling is still in the dark.

230
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
I'm interested in it.

231
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
It's that Bai Shuang.

232
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
A human being

233
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
can not only light up the Wunian Stone,

234
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,940
but also get together with the people in Lanling.

235
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Don't you think it's interesting?

236
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
Master,

237
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,940
you mean

238
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Bai Shuang may be the fairy's trap?

239
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Did they already know that Wunian Stone

240
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
was taken by you?

241
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Whether it's a trap or not,

242
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
it's a matter of time.

243
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,940
If she is really the wife of the fairy,

244
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
she deliberately approached the temple

245
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
to explore the temple's secrets.

246
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,940
That temple

247
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
will be a good place

248
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,940
for her to be sent to.

249
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
The demon is going to eat people?

250
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
He clearly shot me with a spear.

251
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
How come he is trying to trick me?

252
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,940
He has been through so many obstacles on the road.

253
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
He just went to the temple

254
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
to get some food.

255
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
He is so stupid.

256
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
He is so stupid.

257
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
He is so stupid.

258
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,940
He is so stupid.

259
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,940
He is so stupid.

260
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
He is so stupid.

261
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
He is so stupid.

262
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,940
He is so stupid.

263
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
He is so stupid.

264
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
He is so stupid.

265
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
He just went to the temple to get some food.

266
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,940
The food given by Master Sun is useless.

267
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
The demon chased me all the way.

268
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
But he didn't kill anyone.

269
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Is it a trap or a trap?

270
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Master,

271
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
the demon entered Nian'an City

272
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
and didn't enter the entrance of the building.

273
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
He didn't know what to do.

274
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
Demon.

275
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Demon.

276
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Demon.

277
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Come on.

278
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
What are you doing?

279
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Demon.

280
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
Demon.

281
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
What the hell are you doing?

282
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
What the hell are you doing?

284
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,240
A source of抓.

285
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,160
Stand there.

286
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,040
Okay.

287
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,060
Go.

288
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,140
Go...

289
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,300
Go...

290
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,940
cut

291
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
The New Year's building

292
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
Will you dance at my home again

293
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,460
It's you

294
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,380
Japanese circle

295
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,380
But it really 백신

296
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,700
You just go into the city

297
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,220
What are you gonna do

298
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,220
manure

299
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,020
Just made up

300
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,720
Really ridiculous Tribute?

301
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm afraid it's dangerous.

302
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
You can't get away.

303
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Go.

304
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Go.

305
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Go.

306
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Go.

307
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Go.

308
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Go.

309
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Go.

310
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Go.

311
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Go.

312
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Go.

313
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Go.

314
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Go.

315
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Why is this wolf demon coming?

316
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
If that white monster is a fairy,

317
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
the key moment will be the fairy.

318
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
But if he is really just a human being,

319
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
why did we kill him?

320
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Isn't the plan of the five-legged stone falling out?

321
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I've put my body on the wolf demon.

322
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
I only hurt him.

323
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
I've lost enough of this white monster.

324
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Chief!

325
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Chief!

326
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
What's wrong with you?

327
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Miss Bai, you're not well.

328
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
You've run into a monster.

329
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
You're just in time for the wolf demon.

330
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Don't you think I'm a evil demon?

331
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
I'm in trouble.

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
I believe I'm a fairy.

333
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Is it true?

334
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
It's not the next rainy day.

335
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
You have to see if you can help me tonight.

336
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
It's dangerous to run into this.

337
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
You still want to test me.

338
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
But you don't need me.

339
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Don't mention you to me.

340
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I don't use this.

341
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
You have no use.

342
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
I don't have it.

343
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Go.

344
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I'm a fairy.

345
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Fairy?

346
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Fairy?

347
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
The wolf demon is so strong.

348
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
They can't even fight.

349
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
He didn't even try.

350
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
It seems they're not the same.

351
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
It's his blood.

352
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Human blood is so strong.

353
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Why does he have to use the blood of a wolf demon?

354
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Who is he?

355
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Five years later

356
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Five years later

357
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Stop.

358
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Where's the dianrong?

359
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Where is it?

360
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
What is this place?

361
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Five years later

362
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
What is this stone?

363
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
How could it enter my body?

364
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Old man.

365
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Old man, where are we?

366
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
How should I go out?

367
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
You can't survive a mortal life.

368
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Why do you have to report this?

369
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
What?

370
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Living life.

371
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Living life.

372
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Living life.

373
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Living life.

374
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Living life.

375
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Living life.

376
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Living life.

377
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
The sea.

378
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Is this the才華 in the legend?

379
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,300
You still dare to run away from my shop?

380
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
You're so annoying.

381
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Master Lu, no matter what you do,

382
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
send me to the other side.

383
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Why isn't he here?

384
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
He was still there just now.

385
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Stop pretending to be crazy here.

386
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Return the Five-Year Stone to my shop.

387
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Return it.

388
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
You can't get out.

389
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
You actually recognize it?

390
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
The Five-Year Stone is a god.

391
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
The world has long been a god.

392
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Why do you recognize it?

393
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Who is it?

394
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Look at this.

395
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Young Master, we've successfully successfully captured the people.

396
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
The Immortal Army is going to the Fujin Tower.

397
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
The Blue Forest is a good match for the Fujin.

398
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Whoever dies, who lives,

399
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
will be able to fight in the Cold Palace.

400
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,300
I'm really looking forward to this battle.

401
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Xi Xi is also looking forward to it.

402
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Master! Master!

403
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Master!

404
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Master!

405
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Master!

406
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Master!

407
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
Don't shout!

408
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
They were taken away by the Five-Year Stone.

409
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
You're a god! You're useless!

410
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
What should we do?

411
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm a god.

412
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
I have no time to play with you.

413
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Tell me, who are you?

414
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Why do you recognize the god?

415
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Why are you so crazy?

416
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
That Stone is a god.

417
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,300
He just wanted to kill me.

418
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

419
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
What god?

420
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
What god?

421
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I just wanted to save my life.

422
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm a god.

423
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
You're a good man.

424
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
You're dead.

425
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
The Five-Year Stone is out.

426
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Master!

427
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Master!

428
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Wait a minute.

429
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
I don't think the power is working.

430
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
You guys...

431
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Can you please save me?

432
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
The power is not working.

433
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Please...

434
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Please save me.

435
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh no. The power is out.

436
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
I killed the power.

437
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Wait!

438
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
I hurt your power.

439
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
You guys should kill me.

440
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Kill him!

441
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
You said it yourself.

442
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
The Five-Year Stone is a god.

443
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
He can recognize me as the master.

444
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm not a common person.

445
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I don't know why you're here.

446
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
But I'm sure the Five-Year Stone is important to you.

447
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
You think Jiao Ping doesn't want to kill you?

448
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Of course.

449
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
But it's not good for you.

450
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
I want to talk to you about the deal.

451
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
A human group?

452
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Why do you have to cooperate with the power?

453
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
I don't want to be a common person.

454
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
But I don't care.

455
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
I can help you no matter what you do.

456
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
But you have to help me.

457
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
What do I have to help you?

458
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Help me to the place where I just came back.

459
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Find someone important to me.

460
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Zhou!

461
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Uncle Bai.

462
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
When will you come back?

463
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Why are you here so late?

464
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,300
I...

465
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Chongzhuang.

466
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
I told you to grow up in Fuyang.

467
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
You've been a star in Guangqing.

468
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I...

469
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Uncle Bai, I didn't. I'm here to find someone.

470
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Who's here?

471
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
I'm not looking for anyone.

472
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Who are you looking for?

473
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Is Uncle Bai also in there?

474
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
No.

475
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
How dare you come here?

476
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
I'll break your legs.

477
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
I'm not going to meet Uncle Bai.

478
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
What did you see in the Moon and Silver Sea?

479
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
A man who saved my life once.

480
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
He's inside.

481
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
It's not like lying.

482
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Does anyone in the Moon and Silver Sea exist?

483
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Is there a god in the world?

484
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Is this the reason why Wu Nian chose him?

485
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
He's a master in this field.

486
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Aren't you afraid of death?

487
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Yes.

488
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I've been a human for many years.

489
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I'm a god in the world.

490
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm afraid of death.

491
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
But I'm afraid I can't repay him.

492
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
So I can use you.

493
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
I won't expose your identity.

494
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
But you must exchange with me.

495
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I'll do as you say.

496
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
Why should I believe you?

497
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
You're the one who's leading me.

498
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
I'm a mortal.

499
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Open the door!

500
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Uncle Bai.

501
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Uncle Bai.

502
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Don't touch me.

503
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
It's my dad.

504
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Why did he come here at this time?

505
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
The area is a demon.

506
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
The two people next door are not good.

507
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
If they get in a fight,

508
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
they can't move.

509
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
But my dad is the one who's in trouble.

510
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
You think about what you're doing.

511
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
My dad is the master.

512
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
If he sees you like this,

513
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
he'll be sick.

514
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
You want me to be a human?

515
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
The rule of the human is the master.

516
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
No matter what your plan is,

517
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
your dad is sick.

518
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Take care of him.

519
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Don't let him talk.

520
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Don't go down the stairs.

521
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Big brother!

522
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Uncle Bai.

523
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Don't touch me.

524
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Don't touch me.

525
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Uncle Bai.

526
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
You're a bastard.

527
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Uncle Bai.

528
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
Go to the god's house.

529
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Uncle Bai said

530
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,300
we can't go down the stairs.

531
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Dad.

532
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
What a coincidence.

533
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
You're here to play too?

534
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
I'll kill you.

535
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
You're scolding me.

536
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
You brought so many people to the building

537
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
and you're treating me like a dead mother?

538
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
I'm here to learn.

539
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
You think we're too idle?

540
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,300
You bastard.

541
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300
I won't kill you today.

542
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Let go of me.

543
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,300
Uncle Bai.

544
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
I have something to tell you.

545
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
I must tell you now.

546
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Tell me.

547
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
I've already decided on Uncle Bai's wedding.

548
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
I wanted to take care of him

549
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
but I don't want to wait for him anymore.

550
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
You want to go on a wedding

551
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
and tell me your wedding?

552
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
Good boy.

553
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
It's been so many years.

554
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
I finally get to hear you say this.

555
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Go home.

556
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
We're not going back today.

557
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Go home and drink.

558
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Little rabbit.

559
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Go home.

560
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Go.

561
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
You're finally making a fool of yourself.

562
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Master.

563
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Master.

564
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Shan Weizhuang.

565
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Good boy.

566
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
The瞬间一斗.

567
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Tun persona al buses.

568
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Hunter.

569
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,600
If the word was a hunter after she's been killed

570
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
I'd be so sorry if I upset you.

571
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm dead.

572
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
The Wunian clan is out.

573
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
They even killed me.

574
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Although I've reached the transaction,

575
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I still have to do something.

576
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
time to kill

577
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
what's going on.

578
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Why are you crying?

579
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
He's not dead.

580
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
When he was on the phone,

581
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
He violation of the secret on twelve Isen

582
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
they went to fight.

583
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
At the manor four of them went out.

584
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
They are not still on the phone.

585
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,960
As long as we revive the Five-Thousand Poison Stone,

586
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,880
the Hall Master will definitely survive.

587
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,160
But can this be a legend of the world?

588
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,240
The Five-Thousand Poison Stone has been dead.

589
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
I still suspect it.

590
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,320
But now that the Five-Thousand Poison Stone is awake,

591
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,760
and it's still in the White Beast's body,

592
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,600
it means there's a possibility.

593
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,040
I'll go and get the White Beast back now.

594
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
Stop! Why are you getting him back now?

595
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,880
Whether we revive the Five-Thousand Poison Stone or not,

596
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
the Hall Master's life is still not saved.

597
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,480
Now there are three Star Kings in the world.

598
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
We still have a chance.

599
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,440
Now we can't just let the White Beast

600
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,360
catch the more dangerous enemies.

601
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you understand?

602
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,680
I...

603
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,480
Open your business card and take a look.

604
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,600
What is this? It's mysterious.

605
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,880
How did you know I wanted this?

606
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm your sister. Of course I know.

607
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,080
This is a sword made by the Master of the Temple.

608
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,440
It can remove evil spirits.

609
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,720
I wish you a happy and prosperous life.

610
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,200
Happy and prosperous life?

611
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Xi, I want to ask you a question.

612
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,960
Did you really not remember

613
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,520
what happened to the Star of the Last Realm?

614
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,320
But I believe you said it.

615
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,560
But they all said I was stupid and crazy.

616
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,720
No matter what the people say,

617
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,240
they will remember what you said.

618
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,760
I'm Chen Xi.

619
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,080
You are the Star of the Last Realm.

620
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,840
The Star of the Last Realm is the first.

621
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,360
We, A'Shuo,

622
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,440
should be like the Star of the Sky.

623
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,880
The darker the night, the more shining it is.

624
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,120
Today is my birthday.

625
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Do you have to make me cry?

626
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,880
I'm serious, A'Shuo.

627
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,360
As long as you make your decision,

628
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,520
you can go on.

629
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,440
I'll always be by your side.

630
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,320
Thank you, Sister.

631
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,960
You...

632
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Xi,

633
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,840
I think I've met a monster.

634
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,960
He said the Five-Thousand-Eight is a god.

635
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
But why would a god enter me

636
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,160
in a mortal body?

637
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
But I've seen the benefactor today.

638
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,360
The Five-Thousand-Eight is Fan Yue.

639
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,760
Is it related to the benefactor?

640
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,720
Is it the fingerprint

641
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,120
that the benefactor gave me?

642
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,320
A'Shuo,

643
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,480
have you had a drink with my dad?

644
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
A'Shuo,

645
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
let's have a talk.

646
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,440
Thank you for today.

647
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,880
You even said the Star of the Last Realm

648
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,600
to help me get out of the world.

649
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,600
I owe you a favor this time.

650
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm not just here to help you.

651
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,600
You really want to marry me?

652
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,720
I have a lot of fame here.

653
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,840
You don't know that.

654
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
You're in a bad mood.

655
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,840
I just want to take care of you.

656
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,640
You're so weak.

657
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,360
I'll take care of you

658
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
when I get the Star of the Last Realm.

659
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
But A'Shuo,

660
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,720
the benefactor is not like the immortal.

661
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
Don't lie to him.

662
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,200
Zhao is weak.

663
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
He can't do anything but make a hideout.

664
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't let him get into these dangerous things.

665
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Don't worry.

666
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,880
I won't trust him.

667
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,040
I'll take care of these things.

668
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,680
It's late.

669
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,520
I'm going to sleep.

670
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,880
You should rest early.

671
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,680
Don't be too tired.

672
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,400
Wait.

673
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
A'Shuo is in there.

674
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,320
What's wrong?

675
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,400
Nothing.

676
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,000
Go back and rest.

677
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,560
What's with hers?

678
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,840
It has nothing to do with you.

679
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,840
No parent is allowed to get in here.

680
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,200
Choose who 밑And he will take care of you later.

681
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,760
Why is he in Ashou's body?

682
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Zhao, what's wrong with you?

683
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
I can't let Ashou find out I'm a fairy.

684
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,000
I can't go now.

685
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,800
It's okay. I'm just too sleepy.

686
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,880
Go back and rest. I'm going back.

687
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
Why is he out in an end?

688
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,520
I'll buy you your adult horse

689
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,880
No

690
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:36,240
I can't

691
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,320
It's so annoying

692
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,580
I am not alone

693
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,400
If Xianmen knows

694
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,320
Everything doesn't go down

695
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,480
움직асибо

696
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,880
You could just make the book back

697
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
There is no way to reproduce the HR

698
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,320
His highness was enthralled in thejar battle

699
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,260
Empress broke redeployment

700
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
The world is no longer magical.

701
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,860
The Moon Sea is the place where the Star Moon Goddess, the Night Clan, is practicing.

702
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,660
For the past 60,000 years, no one has ever learned its existence.

703
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,860
And even more so, it's gone.

704
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,060
Who is this white-talking person?

705
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,660
The Moon God, Wu Nian Shi.

706
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,860
It's very likely that it was Wu Nian Shi who led us into the Moon Sea.

707
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,860
He can move Wu Nian Shi in the crisis.

708
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,660
His blood can still be the monster's demon power.

709
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,060
No matter who he is, he must have a secret that he doesn't know.

710
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,460
But I checked it again yesterday.

711
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,060
His aura is indeed a human being.

712
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,660
This white-talk person is a mysterious and suspicious person.

713
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,260
After two or three encounters, he has already touched the plan of this store.

714
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,860
At the moment, he is trying to find a way to bring him back to the Moon Palace.

715
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,660
But, Hall Master, you didn't manage to do it yesterday.

716
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,860
I'm afraid that he already has the equipment.

717
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,860
If he gives him a reason why he can't refuse,

718
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,260
he will catch him this week.

719
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,160
Having青蛇本身,

720
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,060
His aura will never touch the game.

721
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:29,660
In fact, it's not a high value 2017 for me,

722
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:36,260
but it's definitely a big year-end award for becoming the secondary player

723
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:54,300
μέ

724
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I'll be back soon.

725
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Bye.

726
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
See you.

727
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
You know my benefactor?

728
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Of course.

729
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Why would I take Wu Nian Shi to the capital?

730
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,300
To help my friend Zhijiao.

731
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I used to feel strange before.

732
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Why would Wu Nian Shi be able to take over the human race?

733
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,300
But you said my friend Gu is your benefactor.

734
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
That makes sense.

735
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
You're afraid of being a fool, aren't you?

736
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
You wanted to kill me yesterday.

737
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
You were in the Dragon King's temple with the water.

738
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
You're the one who killed yourself.

739
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
The Moon and the Sea are magical.

740
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
There's no god in the world.

741
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Last time you went in,

742
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,300
it was Wu Nian Shi who brought the miracle.

743
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
If you want to enter the Moon and the Sea again,

744
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
you must completely open the Moon and the Sea.

745
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,300
I don't want to believe that Wu Nian Shi will choose the human race.

746
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
But the truth is,

747
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,300
to help my friend Zhijiao,

748
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,300
I can only force you to cooperate with this small human race.

749
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Since there's no god in the world,

750
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
and the Moon and the Sea are impossible to enter,

751
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
why would my benefactor be trapped?

752
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,300
You must know the reason for your relationship with him.

753
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Miss Bai is saying that my friend Gu is your benefactor.

754
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,300
I don't know why you're not talking nonsense.

755
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,300
Why?

756
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I want to tell you that

757
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
I want to tell you this.

758
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Since the Tower Master and I are in the same place,

759
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,300
we don't need to be so close.

760
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
How can I open the Moon and the Sea?

761
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
What do I need to do?

762
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Miss Bai is just a little girl.

763
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
But...

764
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Miss Bai is not afraid of me being a demon.

765
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,300
I'm not afraid of being a fake.

766
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,300
From last night to this morning, I've been thinking.

767
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,300
If you're a demon,

768
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
what should I do to help you?

769
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,300
I'm hiding my knife to kill you.

770
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,300
But it seems too naive.

771
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
A demon kills people, kills people,

772
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
and it's hard to count.

773
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
It's a long story.

774
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
So it's still the same as what you said.

775
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
We're friends.

776
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
It's good to have a fairy,

777
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
but it's okay to be a demon.

778
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
I don't ask you for help.

779
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
It doesn't matter what the hell you are.

780
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
As long as you can save my benefactor,

781
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
I can cooperate with you.

782
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Good.

783
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,300
A true person can live long and long.

784
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
What is a five-year-old?

785
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
To start over,

786
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,300
you must love, hate, kill,

787
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,300
be greedy, be kind, and be fearless.

788
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Dad.

789
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,300
What's the point of such a wonderful thing?

790
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Where should we go?

791
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Of course, we should go to the world

792
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
as soon as we can.

793
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I want to leave the village

794
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,300
and follow you.

795
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,300
You've been looking for a long time,

796
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
but you're still suffering.

797
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,300
You've spent so much time,

798
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
energy, and money,

799
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,300
but you're still very devoted to the real fairy.

800
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
You only want to save people

801
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
who are just like the people.

802
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
You know what I'm thinking.

803
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
No matter if Miss Bai believes or doesn't believe,

804
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
this store is your only choice.

805
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,300
You know very well about this.

806
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
Of course.

807
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
If you don't believe,

808
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
you can leave.

809
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,300
I can save people who are just like the people.

810
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,300
I can only leave the city.

811
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,300
You're not a good person,

812
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
but you've given me a bad temper.

813
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Three days.

814
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
I'll answer you three days later.

815
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Why are you waiting for three days?

816
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
You've seen my dad.

817
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
I've been looking for a fairy

818
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
and I've already made him a half-dead.

819
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
If I want to repay his kindness,

820
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
I can't be a filial son.

821
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,300
It's my dad's birthday three days later.

823
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Whether I leave or not,

824
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
I want to spend a good birthday with him.

825
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
It's a problem for the human race.

826
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,300
You're not human race.

827
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,300
Of course you're not.

828
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,300
Life is short and short.

829
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Every birthday boy

830
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,300
has to hold a paper and live well.

831
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
If I really leave,

832
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
I don't know when I'll be back.

833
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
I have to tell him

834
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
that I'm not human.

835
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
I'm afraid.

836
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,300
My heart will always be yours.

837
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,300
Come to me.

838
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Come to me.

839
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,300
Come to me.

840
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
Come to me.

841
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Come to me.

842
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
My heart is so excited.

843
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Come to me.

844
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
Come to me.

845
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Come to me.

846
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,300
Wait for me.

847
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Wait for me.

848
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,300
I'm sorry.

849
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,300
I'm sorry.

850
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,300
I'm sorry.

851
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,300
I'm sorry.

852
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,300
I'm sorry.

853
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
I'm sorry.

854
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,300
I'm sorry.

855
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,300
I'm sorry.

856
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,300
I'm sorry.

857
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,300
I'm sorry.

858
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,300
I'm sorry.

859
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I'm sorry.

860
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,300
I'm sorry.

861
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
I'm sorry.

862
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
I'm sorry.

863
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,300
My heart is so excited.

864
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,300
Come to me.

865
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Come to me.

866
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Come to me.

867
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
Come to me.

868
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Come to me.

869
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:55,300
wichtig

870
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,300
்.
