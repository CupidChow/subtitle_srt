00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a stranger.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
承 relationships.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A virgin.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Have real first sight.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Shedding the peace,

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
everything won't end.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Let life...

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,480
voted for death.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,940

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,220

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,260
From the brol

22
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,100
By a wheelchair

23
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,840
Look these fools

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,900
All inottent

25
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,020
She destroyed my consciousness

26
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,940
Impossible

27
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:12,900
What kind of

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
I know nothing about you.

29
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Since you're here,

30
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
then stay here.

31
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Chongzhao, take Master and Fulin away.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Be careful.

33
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Go!

34
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,900
How did you break the Yi-Shi Sea?

35
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,900
You have to thank me for your reminder.

36
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
The seal of the power is only the power that can be broken.

37
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Don't forget, I have a secret to tell you.

38
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,900
You can kill me with your power.

39
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Why do you want me to be trapped in the Yi-Shi Sea?

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
You want Chongzhao to kill me?

41
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
I told you.

42
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
If you give up,

43
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,900
I'll tell you the last thing you said.

44
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Even if you're in danger,

45
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
we can always be together.

46
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Why did you choose him?

47
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Jingyuan, I've been by your side all night.

48
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
You really forgot?

49
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I'm not Jingwen.

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't care about you.

51
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm not your criminal.

52
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm not worthy of death.

53
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
You're not worthy of death?

54
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
I've waited for you for 60,000 years.

55
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
I've waited for you for 60,000 years.

56
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
You're not Jingyuan.

57
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
But what you love is the heart-to-heart fight.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,900
You're so naive that you can't tell the truth.

59
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,900
You really think you're a man of your own?

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
You're so naive that you can't tell the truth.

61
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,900
You're a man of your own.

62
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
But do you know

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
the fate of Jingyuan is

64
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
that it's one-on-one with your dead body?

65
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
What do you mean?

66
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Why did I have such a big enemy?

67
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm telling you now.

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Because of the battle 60,000 years ago,

69
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Jingyuan killed you in person.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
And now,

71
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
you're the god of Jingyuan.

72
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
You can't chase after me.

73
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
The fate of the 60,000 years ago

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
is the past between Jingyuan and Xingyue.

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
It has nothing to do with me.

76
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,900
You're not her.

77
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Since you're so determined,

78
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
I don't need to keep my hands on you.

79
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,900
The fate of the 60,000 years ago

80
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,900
is the past between Jingyuan and Xingyue.

81
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,900
It has nothing to do with me.

82
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
You're not her.

83
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
You're the god of Jingyuan.

84
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
You're the god of Jingyuan.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,900
You're the god of Jingyuan.

86
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,900
You're the god of Jingyuan.

87
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,900
You're the god of Jingyuan.

88
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,900
The gods of the tribe are all in her body.

89
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Since you love each other,

90
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,900
I'll grant you the right to live together.

91
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
She has the power of the evil spirit.

92
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
We have it too.

93
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Do you remember?

94
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
My blood can make the demon's body stronger.

95
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Shoot the deers!

96
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Beat them!

97
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
It's a two team fight and we're still fighting.

98
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,900
It turns out that right now

99
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,900
the two gods don't like Sasaka's minimalism,

100
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
but we have them now.

101
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,260
Won'tense God你要 Self-Pะ

102
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,200
How romantic

103
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,600
How15

104
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,940
How could you ever

105
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,700
No?

106
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Master.

107
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Nan Ling is not the place you can come if you want to.

108
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Master.

109
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,900
But the sect leader still wants me to come in?

110
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
If you don't come in person next time,

111
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
don't blame Nan Ling for her illegal law.

112
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Law?

113
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Do you still need the law after Nan Ling?

114
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
The sect leader is Nan Ling's law, isn't he?

115
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
I've already given her the jade map and killed her.

116
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
What else are you doing here?

117
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
This is a new jade map.

118
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,900
I still need more jades to restore the original.

119
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,900
The sect leader will create a new jade map.

120
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
The attack was too successful this time.

121
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
If we continue to do this,

122
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,900
we will surely cause other doubts.

123
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Who dares to suspect that you will lose her to the Bodhi Village?

124
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
That's good.

125
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Don't worry, master.

126
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
The battle of the Demon Demon is clear and clear.

127
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I will take you in.

128
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,900
You will be the first person to be known as the first person to be known.

129
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Why did Ling Yi move all of a sudden?

130
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Did something happen to the sect leader?

131
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Do you know why I named him that?

132
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Seeing Xuan Yuanxuan in the папing Manor,

133
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I élabeledlove him too late.

134
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,580
I too was already its master

135
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,900
and able to spelat the demon ten.

136
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,700
At that time,準 compañ roni might have noticed

137
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,900
the important matter regarding my отervation.

138
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,620
Gatekeeper Deng!

139
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,140
ained peace a dame?

140
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
Master, you finally woke up.

141
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
I've been living for thousands of years.

142
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
I've never met anything.

143
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
I can't die.

144
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Master, how did you enter the Bodhi Village?

145
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,140
It's a golden medicine.

146
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
I've been living for thousands of years.

147
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
I've never met anything.

148
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
It's a golden medicine.

149
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,460
I've accidentally broken its secret about the ancient

150
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
new method secretly.

151
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,140
It caught me and gave me to the Bodhi Village.

152
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,140
The clothes in the cave are all the ancestors sent by the golden medicine.

153
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Every single ancestor in the Bodhi Village

154
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,140
will have a different kind of person.

155
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,140
All of this is a secret.

156
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Where's my parents?

157
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Did my parents really die in the Bodhi Village?

158
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I'm not sure.

159
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
There are no people in the cave anyway.

160
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,140
There are many ancestors who have been living in the cave for hundreds of years.

161
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Maybe they were hidden somewhere else.

162
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,140
There's something that I've been thinking about for a long time.

163
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,140
While everyone is there, it's time to face it.

164
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,140
You've been wanting to know why I'm hiding in the forest.

165
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,140
I'm trying to hide in the rain.

166
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
Rain?

167
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Rain is looking for three children who are very sweet.

168
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Ten years ago, he caught me and forced me to not count the three children's whereabouts.

169
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,140
I told him about the two children for the sake of my life.

170
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,140
One is in the Bai family in Ning'an City.

171
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,140
The other is in the Bai family.

172
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,140
You're the one who hid the rain.

173
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,140
I know I'm very serious this year.

174
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm sorry for the Bai family and the Bai Zezu.

175
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,140
It's because I'm guilty.

176
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,140
But the more I'm guilty, the more I dare not tell you the truth.

177
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,140
When the rain stopped counting, you knew what would happen later.

178
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,140
If I knew that after the counting, I would bring so much blood and bitterness,

179
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,140
even if I died, I wouldn't count it.

180
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,140
But there's nothing like it.

181
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
What happened is what happened.

182
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
It's all wrong.

183
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,140
It's me who's guilty.

184
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Then tell me the whereabouts of the third child.

185
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I don't know why the third child is looking for three children.

186
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
I'm afraid that he'll succeed.

187
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
I won't keep counting.

188
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,140
I lied to him that the third child is still alive.

189
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
The rain...

190
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,140
This is the most dangerous thing.

191
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,140
It's him again.

192
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Master, what's going on?

193
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Are you all right?

194
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm telling you, Lingling.

195
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,140
No need.

196
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
My roots are rotten.

197
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,140
I'm dead.

198
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Take this.

199
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,140
This is my precious.

200
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Why are you giving me this?

201
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,140
I don't want it.

202
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
I'm telling you to take it.

203
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm telling you to take it.

204
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
You take it yourself.

205
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
You take it yourself.

206
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
This is the precious precious you stole.

207
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Take it to the medicine.

208
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Maybe you can make a list of it.

209
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Take it.

210
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Take it.

211
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
Save it.

212
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,140
The person you want to save is also a precious thing.

213
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
You're not afraid of it.

214
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Master.

215
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,140
I want you to live well.

216
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
You won't die.

217
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Are you willing to call me a master again?

218
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,140
Even if I die, I won't regret it.

219
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,140
Do you remember when you were resting with me in Lanyan?

220
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,140
I told you what life is.

221
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:17,140
Life is from nothing to nothing.

222
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,140
You have to learn to accept the things you have learned in the battlefield.

223
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I like freedom.

224
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,140
Now I'm free.

225
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
I'm free.

226
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Master.

227
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Master.

228
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Master.

229
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Master.

230
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
Master.

231
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
You're the one who stole the precious precious.

232
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,140
It's not even worth a thousand years.

233
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I'm dead.

234
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,140
The precious is yours.

235
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
When will you be waiting?

236
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,140
How can you be afraid of me?

237
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
How can I?

238
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,140
I think you're more afraid of living than me.

239
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm not good at your medical skills.

240
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Good to know.

241
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,140
I still can't save Master.

242
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
You've tried your best.

243
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,140
I used to think that Master is the precious of the ancestors.

244
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,140
It must last for a long time.

245
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,140
I never thought he would leave me.

246
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Why would he be so sudden?

247
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
I used to come to him often.

248
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I fought with him.

249
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,140
I always took him for a drink.

250
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,140
At that time, I thought that the future would be long.

251
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,140
I would smile at him again in the future.

252
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,140
But when I came here accidentally,

253
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,140
the future was all fake.

254
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Do whatever you want.

255
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Don't wait.

256
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
Although the Pearl is dead,

257
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,140
there are still many hidden clues.

258
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
I haven't found the body of my parents.

259
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
I'll have to keep it for a while.

260
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Your parents have been trapped here for ten years.

261
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
You should find it.

262
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,140
I'll be there wherever you are.

263
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,140
I used to watch Man Tian's reflection.

264
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
I often watch it with him.

265
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Now you're in support.

266
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,140
It's a pity that I can't go back to the past.

267
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,140
No matter what happens, you're still a white-haired man.

268
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,140
You should face it.

269
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Don't leave a trace.

270
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,140
I've told you before.

271
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
After people die,

272
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,140
they will become the stars of the sky.

273
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
After parents die,

274
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,140
I'll always laugh at the stars.

275
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I'll look for them wherever I am.

276
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,140
But I won't be able to find them.

277
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
I'll be there.

278
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
I'll be there.

279
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
I'll be there.

280
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,140
I'll be there.

281
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
I'll be there.

282
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,140
But I've never found A-xi's body.

283
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Because I've always been a spy.

284
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
She's not dead.

285
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,140
When do you want to escape?

286
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Ever since I was little,

287
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,140
you've been protecting me.

288
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
I thought my sister was the bravest person

289
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,140
who was the most brave person in A-die.

290
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,140
But why doesn't she even have the courage to face me?

291
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,140
I killed her.

292
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,140
I've been a spy for a long time.

293
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm not qualified to be your sister.

294
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:57,140
My brother is not qualified to be her daughter.

295
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,140
If A-die is still alive,

296
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,140
she'll only be happy that you love her and live well.

297
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,140
She won't blame you.

298
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I promised A-die that I'd find you.

299
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,140
A-xi, I've grown up.

300
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,140
I can protect you.

301
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,140
I'll take you to the antidote.

302
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,140
Go home with me, okay?

303
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Ning'an is a poor girl you like.

304
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,140
She's been living in the city for a long time.

305
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Ning'an has found a good husband.

306
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,140
You should come back in ten years.

307
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,140
A-xi, you should come back.

308
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Let's go home, okay?

309
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
A-xi.

310
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,140
I'm not afraid of the future.

311
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,140
Xuan Gui said that Zhen Yu wanted three children who were born to be born.

312
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,140
Now it seems that one is Fan Yue and the other is A-xi.

313
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Who is the third child?

314
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,140
I've never heard of it.

315
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,140
But why did he let you go so easily today?

316
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,140
You've saved me from the dark world because of his order.

317
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
You've lost his secret today.

318
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,140
He let you go because of what I said.

319
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,140
He found something on my body.

320
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,140
And I felt that he had a power beyond the demon's power.

321
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,140
A power beyond the demon's power?

322
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Zhen Yu entered the demon's body so early in the morning.

323
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
He wanted me to take the poison from the enemy.

324
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
The Immortal's Laws of the Immortal's Laws is unbearable.

325
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
You'll only die if you follow Sun Hui.

326
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,140
What does Master want?

327
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Chong Zhao was in a state of hatred with Zhen Yu.

328
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Zhen Yu didn't kill him.

329
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,140
But why did he let him enter the demon's body?

330
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Did he...

331
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
No, he didn't.

332
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
I must have done something wrong.

333
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,140
What are you thinking about sitting here alone?

334
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Nothing.

335
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
What's wrong?

336
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Nothing.

337
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,140
We should go to find Uncle and Auntie's body.

338
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
I'm going to do it.

339
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
I'll go with you.

340
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Are you feeling better?

341
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,140
Don't worry. I'm not that weak. Let's go.

342
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
What's wrong?

343
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Nothing.

344
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,140
You're not well. Don't catch a cold.

345
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I've never thought about the situation between us.

346
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,140
I never thought that I'd leave Master.

347
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Life is full of ups and downs.

348
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
It's always changing.

349
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,140
No matter what happens around you,

350
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm always by your side.

351
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Actually, I didn't guess this all the way.

352
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
Guess what?

353
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Why did the five-leaf stone get into my body?

354
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Why did I have to move the spirit's body?

355
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Why did my blood flow?

356
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,140
I've never thought that I was special.

357
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Now I have an answer.

358
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,140
But the four words of the New Moon God.

359
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
They seem to be very clear.

360
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
They seem to be very heavy.

361
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
What are you worried about, Shuang?

362
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,140
The New Moon God is an old man.

363
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
But I'm just a normal person.

364
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,140
I don't know what the meaning behind this.

365
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,140
And the story between the New Moon and the Golden Moon.

366
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,140
It seems to be not the same.

367
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
You mean that the New Moon killed the Golden Moon?

368
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,140
You don't have to put the words of the Wanderer in your heart.

369
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
It's not because of the Wanderer.

370
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I saw it.

371
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
I saw it.

372
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
I saw it.

373
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
When I was in the Wanderer,

374
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,140
I saw some pictures of the New Moon and the Golden Moon.

375
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,140
It's not just a simple story.

376
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,140
But I didn't see much.

377
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Those are the past.

378
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,140
This time, we met again.

379
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Not the New Moon and the Golden Moon.

380
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
But the White Book and the Moon.

381
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,140
In my heart, you are the best White Book.

382
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
You are the only one in the world.

383
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
You can't replace it.

384
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,140
There's one more thing.

385
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
The Wanderer has opened a new world.

386
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
It means that the Wanderer is in the Wanderer.

387
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,140
Now that the Wanderer is dead,

388
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,140
the villagers are gone.

389
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,140
Everything seems to be settled.

390
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,140
But why hasn't the Wanderer appeared yet?

391
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,140
I think he's back.

392
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
I didn't find anything.

393
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
Neither did I.

394
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Xuan Gui said that the bodies in the cave are not all.

395
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
But the whole village didn't find anything.

396
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Could it be that the Wanderer has lost his memory?

397
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
Although the Wanderer cooperates with the Golden Demon,

398
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
it's just a coincidence.

399
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
They must be both suspicious.

400
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
The Wanderer must have some evidence.

401
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,140
Maybe it's related to the Fairy Tribe.

402
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,140
That makes sense.

403
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
Let's go to the Wanderer's room.

404
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Maybe there's a new clue.

405
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,140
The Wanderer

406
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Chong Zhang

407
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,140
These are the names of the Fairy Tribe

408
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
that the Fairy Tribe has been carrying along.

409
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
The Fairy Tribe

410
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Father.

411
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Mother.

412
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
You've been in the Wanderer's heart for ten years.

413
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,140
But today, there's finally an answer.

414
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Every Fairy Tribe here

415
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
represents a dead Fairy Tribe.

416
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,140
These are the crimes of Wanderer and Golden Demon.

417
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,140
The Wanderer must have been in the Wanderer's dream.

418
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll go back to Laning and tell them everything.

419
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
I'll go with you.

420
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
You haven't fully recovered from your poison.

421
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,140
They don't know that you've already left the Cold Palace.

422
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
It's not easy for you to meet Uncle.

423
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
You'd better wait for me at the Cold Palace with them.

424
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
But...

425
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Don't worry.

426
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,140
I'm the Wanderer's disciple.

427
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
They'll believe me.

428
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,140
So, the Wanderer has hidden the Fairy Tribe here.

429
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Thank you for finding me.

430
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
Where did Ah Xi and Chong Zhao go?

431
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,140
They might have gone to find the body of the Wanderer.

432
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
The old ghost said that

433
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
there are many other Fairy Tribe disciples who are in the Wanderer's Village.

434
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
They're all just evils.

435
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Let's go help them out.

436
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
I'll get the antidote for Ah Xi first.

437
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
When the Wanderer's Hall is back,

438
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I'll definitely get the antidote.

439
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
I'll go get the antidote.

440
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I'll go get the antidote.

441
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
I'll go get the antidote.

442
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
I'll go get the antidote.

443
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
I'll go get the antidote.

444
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Let's go.

445
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
What's the matter?

446
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
You haven't seen them for days.

447
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,140
You don't even want to teach them a lesson.

448
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,140
You really sent them into the Wanderer's Village.

449
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Yes.

450
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Every Fairy Tribe on the wall

451
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,140
was sent in by me.

452
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
My parents are your disciples.

453
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,140
Why did you kill them?

454
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
I've given them many chances.

455
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
In the past, in the dreamland of Chongtai,

456
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
someone discovered that

457
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
the Fairy Tribe disciples were missing.

458
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
They were all chasing after them.

459
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
I tried to persuade them many times,

460
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
but they still didn't give up.

461
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,140
Later, they broke the secrets between me and the Wanderer.

462
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,140
I didn't want to marry them.

463
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
But they were obsessed with me.

464
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,140
They were going against me.

465
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
They were going against me.

466
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,140
They were only going to die.

467
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
My parents were so pure in their lives.

468
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,140
They were so loyal to me.

469
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
You are their brother.

470
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,140
How could you do that?

471
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,140
It's hard to kill them.

472
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,140
But your parents are not the food.

473
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,140
You can't blame me.

474
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Cheng Zhao,

475
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,140
your parents' corpse was destroyed by the Wanderer.

476
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,140
You can't find it.

477
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,140
If you can forget everything that happened in the Wanderer Village,

478
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I can spare your life.

479
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,140
It's a good thing that we can try again.

480
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,140
What choice did my parents make?

481
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,140
I'm like them now.

482
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
I'll never compromise.

483
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Jin Yao,

484
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,140
you colluded with the Wanderer and killed the Tong Clan.

485
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
What's the point of being a master of Chong Zhao?

486
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,140
You should have let the people see your face.

487
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Some people have a good reputation,

488
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,140
but you once lived in a human tribe.

489
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
I was able to live without death.

490
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,140
This is a place that I can't think of until now.

491
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Then, today,

492
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,140
you should take this issue to the yellow power road and think about it.

493
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Just you two?

494
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
If you add me,

495
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
you can't work with Wanderer.

496
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
So you should know that I'm here.

497
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,140
You two have a fight with Wanderer.

498
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
It's a loss.

499
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
It's a loss.

500
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,140
When will I be able to come here?

501
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
You killed my master.

502
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,140
Your master's luck is really bad.

503
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,140
It broke my secret with Wanderer.

504
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,140
It's been a long time since Xuan Gui's death.

505
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Chong Zhao has been a weak and strong man.

506
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
He knows everything.

507
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
But you've been so mean to him.

508
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
You've made him a criminal.

509
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Jing Yao, you said you'd protect the Great Sage.

510
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
You're a good man.

511
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,140
You're doing this for the sake of killing the same tribe.

512
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Bai Shu, think about it.

513
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
When you were a kid,

514
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,140
you were watching the cold palace and the city.

515
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
You were so helpless.

516
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,140
I was so helpless.

517
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
I was so selfish.

518
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
But the Great Sage,

519
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,140
I couldn't change the name of the great Sage.

520
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,140
I couldn't stop the evil tribe from killing the four women.

521
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,140
The only way out is to become strong.

522
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Only then can I do what I want to do.

523
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
I want to protect it.

524
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
But in the process of becoming strong,

525
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,140
my heart has changed.

526
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,140
You won't understand.

527
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,140
The Blue Forest is now under the hands of the late Sage.

528
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,140
It's under the control of the Great Sage.

529
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,140
It's under the control of the other tribes.

530
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,140
It's not my credit.

531
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Am I wrong?

532
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
You're wrong.

533
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,140
The future of becoming strong is to work hard.

534
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Not to be a failure to become a great Sage.

535
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Today, we're going to help my parents,

536
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,140
my master and the innocent souls of the Great Sage.

537
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
We'll take back the justice.

538
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Justice is never in the mouth.

539
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,140
Only then can we be strong.

540
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,140
How could you be so spiritual?

541
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,140
Do you really think that the first-class warriors

542
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,140
can only have such little ability?

543
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
These years, I've worked with the Ghost-Demon Sect.

544
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,140
I've got many divine powers from the ancient gods.

545
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,140
I've been practicing for a hundred years.

546
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,140
I've been able to hide my spiritual power well.

547
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,140
I'm not afraid of being defeated.

548
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,140
It's been a long time.

549
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
You have such a powerful spiritual power.

550
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Why did you take the Ghost-Demon Sect away?

551
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
It's really the Hall Leader.

552
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,140
He found one of the most important clues.

553
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,140
I've been looking for ways to open the Ghost-Demon Sect.

554
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,140
So I decided to let you take the Ghost-Demon Sect away.

555
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,140
I wanted to take it away when you were in a hurry.

556
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,140
I didn't expect you to find the White-Corded Stone so soon.

557
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,140
But it seems that you've been missing for years.

558
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Give me the White-Corded Stone.

559
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,460
Master, you got it!

560
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,740
Master, why are you here?

561
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,460
I saw your body.

562
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,780
I saw you have found the Glass Bat!

563
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,960
I saw the Fighter Fey!

564
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,740
Use it.

565
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,080
Qi Shun.

566
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,440
The

567
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:04,080
Zen Xing

568
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
The Seven Stars?

569
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
The Seven Stars' seal?

570
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,080
My good friend Chongzhao has already sent a message to tell me.

571
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
How could I not prepare?

572
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Chongzhao once trusted you so much.

573
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
You only use it to fight back.

574
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
You're so despicable!

575
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,080
The Nuan Zhu once told me that the Seven Stars' seal

576
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
was to cultivate the ancient demon magic.

577
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,080
And my spiritual power comes from the ancient new scriptures.

578
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:36,080
How about we try to see if I can get the last star?

579
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
No!

580
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,080
From now on, no matter how much the world is in danger,

581
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Cui Yun!

582
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Now, I should wait for you.

583
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
No!

584
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Xinyi!

585
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,080
You can control the power of the eye!

586
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Who are you?

587
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
No!

588
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Chongzhao!

589
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Chongzhao!

590
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Cui Yun!

591
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Cui Yun!

592
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Cui Yun!

593
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Cui Yun!

594
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Cui Yun!

595
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Come on!

596
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Come on!

597
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:43,080
My heart is so excited.

598
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,080
Wait for me.

599
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,080
The stars are shining brightly.

600
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,080
You are the light I long for.

601
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,080
You are the lonely pain.

602
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Let this moment be with you.

603
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:17,080
Let the sea of people pass by.

604
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:25,080
The stars are shining brightly.

605
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,080
You are the blue earth I long for.

606
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Let the rain and the wind blow.

607
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,080
Let the tears be filled.

608
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:49,080
Let the life be with you.
