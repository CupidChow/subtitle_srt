1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 39]

19
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,280
The former Lady Fu Ling was spirited and resolute,

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,750
with swift and ruthless judgment.

21
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,800
But today, although you are holding a sharp blade,

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
there’s no opportunity to wield it.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,340
What a pity.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,840
Why don't I give you a chance?

25
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,510
What do you want?

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,750
I've said that

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,700
once I've returned, I shall reign supreme over the world.

28
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,450
Although the Eastern Continent's Eternals and demons are weak,

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,380
a good number of them collectively

30
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,329
makes for a decent supplement.

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,060
As long as you obey

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,290
and capture Eternals and demons for me,

33
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,090
you are allowed to enter and exit

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,500
Cold Spring Palace freely.

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,940
After all,

36
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,670
you used to do this sort of thing all the time,

37
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,620
didn’t you?

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,190
No way.

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,280
What if Chong Zhao's life is at stake?

40
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,260
Let's see how you choose.

41
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,850
Chong Zhao!

42
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,700
Xi.

43
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,900
Xi.

44
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,480
Chong Zhao.

45
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,740
You are still here.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,140
You really are still here.

47
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,070
There’s still so much we haven’t accomplished yet.

48
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,810
I know you're waiting for me.

49
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,110
I won't disappear so easily.

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,660
How sincere

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,870
and touching.

52
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,260
Actually, the existence of you two

53
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,480
is not something

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,530
I find entirely unacceptable.

55
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,740
Chong Zhao.

56
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,380
Persuade her well.

57
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,850
Instead of resisting,

58
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,460
why not obey me?

59
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,780
That's the only wise choice.

60
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,350
Xi.

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,580
You were forced to be a demon for ten years

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,840
and suffered for ten years.

63
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,310
You finally escaped Cold Spring Palace

64
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,650
to become Bai Xi again.

65
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,750
You must not go back to your old ways.

66
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,380
The righteousness of the world

67
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,070
and your future is always more important than my life.

68
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't you ever feel threatened by him.

69
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,370
That's not what I want to hear.

70
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Zhao!

71
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,450
Zhao!

72
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,790
Xi.

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,610
Remember,

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,610
regardless of how Mo Li treats me,

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,480
even if he kills me,

76
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,040
you mustn't give in to him.

77
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,350
How stubborn.

78
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,070
I really don't understand

79
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,990
why you would fall for

80
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,940
such a boring and stubborn person.

81
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,100
You will

82
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,420
never understand his loyalty!

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
Your so-called morality

84
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,880
is the most hypocritical and ridiculous in my eyes.

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,640
I may have given you a chance,

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,050
but that doesn't mean you are irreplaceable.

87
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,570
Since you don't appreciate it,

88
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,490
you can just stand by and watch

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,390
how the Eternals and demons grovel at my feet,

90
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,900
begging for mercy.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,190
Xiu Yan once said

92
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,060
he could feel that

93
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,210
the Xing Yue Divine Bow is right above the Eastern Continent.

94
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,790
But no matter how I summon it,

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,640
the Divine Bow wouldn't appear.

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,730
The Contemplation Stone and the Outlander King's Sword also had no reaction to it.

97
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,120
The Contemplation Stone and the Sword acknowledged you as its master

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,190
because they sensed that

99
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,740
you have Xing Yue's Divine Mantle,

100
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,080
but the Xing Yue Bow remained completely silent.

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,960
Unless...

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,290
Unless it's not yet awakened

103
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,000
and doesn't know it's a Divine Bow.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,659
Back then, the Xing Yue Divine Bow could defy Xing Yue's own wishes

105
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,990
and shot Jing Yuan down.

106
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,270
This means it has its own consciousness.

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,670
It's different from other divine objects.

108
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,490
Bad news.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,050
Mo Li launched a sudden attack on various demon clans and Eternal sects.

110
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,510
Many Eternals and demons have nowhere to go.

111
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,030
They've all fled to the Polar Region for refuge.

112
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,170
Mo Li has gathered several demon warriors

113
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,700
to attack the Polar Region.

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,130
The Polar Region's terrain is vast and complex.

115
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,080
It's certainly possible to take in the Eternals and demons seeking refuge.

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,620
I believe the demon warriors of Bright Moon Palace

117
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,690
are not afraid of a battle.

118
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,830
But here in the Polar Region,

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,010
there are also many little demons that you saved.

120
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,240
If Mo Li attacks,

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,700
they won't be able to withstand it.

122
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,990
On the day we established this palace in the Polar Region,

123
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,270
I made it clear that no one would be allowed to encroach on my territory.

124
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,670
What are you trying to do?

125
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,320
Jing Yuan left all of his divine power to me.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,510
I can summon the Purple Moon above the Polar Region

127
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,910
and protect the entire Polar Region with my primal power.

128
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,770
Although the primal power of the Demon Lord is strong,

129
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,930
the Polar Region spans hundreds of thousands of miles of land.

130
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,990
If you form a barrier with your divine power,

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,760
it will inevitably consume your power continuously.

132
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,670
Master.

133
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,280
You're draining yourself.

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,280
Anyone who comes to the Polar Region,

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,620
whether an Eternal or a demon,

136
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,500
is entrusting their life to me.

137
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,710
I will protect them all.

138
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,020
Master!

139
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,060
Aren't you going to stop him?

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,900
If he isn't going to resolve matters this way,

141
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,080
he wouldn’t be the Master of Bright Moon Palace

142
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,820
or the Fan Yue I know.

143
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,280
He has endured too much suffering

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,659
and faced too many hardships in the past.

145
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,250
That's why he wants to stand in front of others

146
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,510
and shield those who are also suffering.

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,720
This is his choice.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,400
I agree and I won't stop him.

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,450
As for my choice...

150
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
I've already told you.

151
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,480
We shall fight side by side,

152
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,110
sharing both life and death.

153
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,410
Purple Moon!

154
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,960
-It's the Purple Moon!
-It's the Purple Moon!

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,620
It's the Purple Moon! Look!

156
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,990
Purple Moon!

157
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,860
It's the Demon Lord who is using the Purple Moon Power to form a barrier

158
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,820
in order to block Mo Li's attack.

159
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,350
I didn't expect that us Eternals have to escape to the Polar Region

160
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,330
and receive protection from Fan Yue

161
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,730
in order to survive.

162
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,670
Fan Yue.

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm fine.

164
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,160
Previously, Eternals and demons all believed that

165
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,260
the Master of Bright Moon was ruthless by nature.

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,830
Now, they will all know that

167
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,090
you are the most merciful one.

168
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,520
It doesn't matter whether they know or not.

169
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
What matters is

170
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,870
no matter what happens next,

171
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,560
I mustn't allow Mo Li's wild ambitions succeed.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,910
60,000 years ago,

173
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,600
Mo Li destroyed the Divine Region.

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,880
60,000 years later,

175
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,830
I won't let him destroy the Eastern Continent again.

176
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,260
It was exactly this Purple Moon that

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,990
gave me immense hope back then.

178
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,670
It's the same this time.

179
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,440
The appearance of the Purple Moon

180
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,820
will protect the Eternals and demons.

181
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660
Mo Li,

182
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,870
you can't win after all.

183
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,150
Do you really think that the Purple Moon's protection of the Polar Region

184
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,730
will safeguard those Eternals and demons for a lifetime?

185
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,430
No one can stop me

186
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,070
from doing what I want.

187
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,930
Shuo and Fan Yue won't sit back and do nothing.

188
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,330
I'm sure they'll find a way to restrain you.

189
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,990
Really?

190
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,230
I'm afraid the Human Race can't wait till then.

191
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,350
What do you mean?

192
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,910
The humans are unaware of the Eternals, the demons,

193
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,210
or the Polar Region,

194
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,250
nor do they know about the impending catastrophe in the world.

195
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,630
They're still at the same place,

196
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,910
living their peaceful lives.

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,430
The Purple Moon can barely safeguard the Polar Region as it is.

198
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,690
How can it protect the entire Human Race?

199
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,820
You're...

200
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,790
You're actually planning to target the Human Race?

201
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,330
You're at least an ancient deity.

202
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,190
How could you be this despicable?

203
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,060
In my eyes,

204
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,350
there is only success or failure.

205
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,350
There's no such thing as benevolence or otherwise.

206
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,030
Tomorrow,

207
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,870
I'll put on a good show for you.

208
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you satisfied

209
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,980
with this show?

210
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,730
You want to use human blood

211
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,610
to break the Purple Moon Barrier?

212
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,930
The Purple Moon's divine power is extremely yang,

213
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,690
while human blood is extremely yin.

214
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,750
Yin and yang neutralizes each other,

215
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,580
so why not?

216
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,750
Kill me if you dare!

217
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,570
Killing you would be too easy.

218
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,250
It's only fun if I torture you.

219
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,880
Offering the blood of thousands

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,780
will surely incur heaven's wrath!

221
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,110
Heaven's wrath?

222
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,510
If the Heaven is capable of killing me,

223
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,300
I would have died 60,000 years ago.

224
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,540
Heaven has set a rule that only a Supreme Deity

225
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,780
can completely kill another Supreme Deity.

226
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,270
Even the Heaven has to follow its own rules.

227
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,280
Sacrifice!

228
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,950
Look at the scenery.

229
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,650
Blood staining the Polar Region.

230
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,490
How spectacular!

231
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,740
You'll face retribution.

232
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,270
You'll definitely face retribution!

233
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,250
Shut up!

234
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,530
I think I am already hearing

235
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,260
the blood currents climbing over the Purple Lunar Barrier.

236
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,730
Very soon...

237
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,220
Master.

238
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,360
All the Eternals and demons seeking refuge have been taken care of.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,340
In the face of a powerful enemy,

240
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,330
both sides have set aside their past prejudices

241
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,660
and are living in peace.

242
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,330
Master.

243
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
What's wrong?

244
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,060
Are you not feeling well?

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,230
-Master!
-Fan Yue!

246
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,350
What's going on?

247
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,610
Human blood sacrifice?

248
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,710
The Purple Lunar Barrier has been broken.

249
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,920
Xi!

250
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,770
Shuo, I'm fine.

251
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,190
You're finally here.

252
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,210
Chong Zhao would never commit such a heinous act as a human blood sacrifice.

253
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,970
You are nothing like him.

254
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,990
How could a weak and incompetent Chong Zhao

255
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,710
ever compare to me?

256
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,350
The human blood broke the Purple Lunar Barrier so quickly.

257
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,530
It seems that you are no longer Jing Yuan.

258
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,410
Whether I'm Fan Yue or Jing Yuan,

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,780
I won't let you succeed.

260
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,900
The indiscriminate killing of

261
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,350
innocent humans is utterly inhumane.

262
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,380
Mo Li.

263
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,110
You don't deserve to be a deity.

264
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,990
That's not up to you to decide.

265
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,150
You all...

266
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,270
can't stop me from achieving my grand plan.

267
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,240
You've clearly overestimated your abilities.

268
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,950
You only have Xing Yue's Divine Mantle.

269
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,240
Now without the power of the Contemplation Stone,

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,369
you're nothing but an ant

271
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,119
in my eyes.

272
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,060
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

273
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,530
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

274
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,150
♫My love brought tears♫

275
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,350
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

276
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,400
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

277
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,810
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

278
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,000
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

279
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,160
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

280
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

281
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,250
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

282
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,490
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

283
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,520
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

284
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,350
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

285
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,750
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

286
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,700
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

287
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,150
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

288
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,420
Where am I?

289
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,040
This is the Unbridled Pavilion.

290
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,250
Fan Yue took us back to Ning'an City.

291
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,940
Ning'an City?

292
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm finally back.

293
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,430
Don't talk.

294
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,170
Let me give you some energy.

295
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,450
Shuo, don't cry.

296
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,990
In this lifetime,

297
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,710
it has been my greatest fortune

298
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,910
to be able to reunite with you.

299
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,310
But from now on,

300
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,070
I can't protect you any longer.

301
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,680
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

302
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,060
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

303
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,290
No.

304
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
♫I remember that word of concern♫

305
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,390
We've only just reunited.

306
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,230
Didn't we agree to

307
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,510
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

308
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,660
overcome difficulties

309
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,780
and start over together?

310
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,820
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

311
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,710
Don't leave me, will you?

312
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,970
♫It dried in the wind♫

313
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,820
I don't want to leave you either, Shuo.

314
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,300
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

315
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,440
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

316
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,020
But in this lifetime of mine,

317
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,700
I've done too much wrong.

318
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,680
♫That year, that year♫

319
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,580
I have to make up for it somehow.

320
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,020
The ten years spent in Cold Spring Palace

321
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,470
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

322
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,600
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

323
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,370
were like shackles

324
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,000
that held me captive.

325
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,720
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

326
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,460
Maybe this way,

327
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,000
♫That year, that year♫

328
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,110
I can be truly free.

That's right, Xi.

The dumplings are going to get cold if you don't eat.

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,970
might not be the best with other dishes,

377
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,440
but these dumplings are at least decent.

378
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Decent?

379
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,890
If it's just decent, then don't eat.

00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,240
It's best if you remain obediently

502

in the depths of this sea of consciousness.

503
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,840
If you dare to disturb me again,

504
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,520
I have no qualms of personally destroying

505

If you dare to destroy it, why haven't you done it yet?

As long as my divine consciousness is gone,

you will also be severely hurt.

I’m laughing because you’re pathetic.

516
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,810
You call yourself a deity,

517
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,110
but you have no idea what love is,

518

With Mo Li's sinister blood sacrifice,

human blood is now infused into the Purple Moon's divine power,

creating a force of both extreme yin and yang

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,160
are in Bai Shuo’s hands.

669
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,610
Whether you live

670
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,110
or die

671
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,870
is completely up to her.

672
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,940
[To the esteemed Lady Tian Huo]

673
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,070
Hidden Lord Mo Li, with the lives of all Eternals and demons at stake,

674
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,780
demands that Bai Shuo goes to Cold Spring Palace alone

675
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,350
within the next day.

676
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,220
If she does not arrive within the next day, or more than one person arrives,

677
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,380
he will kill all Eternals and demons.

678
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,720
We urge Lady Tian Huo to think carefully.

679
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,880
I've fed him the pill,

680
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,500
but he's still unconscious—

681
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,730
What's wrong?

682
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,900
Nothing.

683
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Tian Huo.

684
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,720
At this point,

685
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,180
no matter what happens,

686
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,810
don't hide anything from me.

687
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,280
It's a letter from the demon warriors.

688
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,150
Mo Li has taken control of all the Eternals and demons

689
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,150
and sent word that

690
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,720
you are to go to Cold Spring Palace alone.

691
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,350
Otherwise, in one day,

692
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,440
he will kill all Eternals and demons.

693
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,860
You were always by my side during

694
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,880
every life-and-death moment in the past.

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,090
This time,

696
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,460
I'll have to face it myself.

697
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,590
Do you remember I once said that

698
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,080
the terms "Xing Yue's Divine Mantle"

699
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,420
seems very light?

700
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,100
It seems so light that I could just assume it as a story,

701
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,750
but it also seems so heavy.

702
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,520
It's as though the fate of the entire world is weighing down on it.

703
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,230
I'm just a human.

704
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,100
I've never once thought of becoming a deity that could save the world.

705
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,200
But now, the world stands on the brink of catastrophe,

706
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,480
its safety suddenly hanging by a thread.

707
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,750
I cannot...

708
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,870
and will not run away.

709
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,130
Fan Yue.

710
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,610
Forgive me for leaving alone.

711
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,720
Have you really thought it through?

712
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,060
At this point,

713
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,610
I have no choice.

714
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,180
Fan Yue has almost expended himself

715
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,890
just to protect the Eternals and demons.

716
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,800
I won't back down either.

717
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,690
I have no idea if Fan Yue will ever wake up,

718
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,890
or when that might be.

719
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,010
But if he wakes up,

720
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,490
you mustn't let him go to Cold Spring Palace.

721
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,120
You may want to save the Eternals and demons,

722
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,360
but have you ever thought about yourself?

723
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,870
Mo Li is clearly targeting you

724
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,330
by demanding you go alone.

725
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,900
Back when my father was forced to die in Ning'an City,

726
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,380
I hated the world

727
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,490
when I was leaving.

728
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,940
I didn't believe in Eternals,

729
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,790
demons, humans,

730
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,450
and even deities.

731
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,400
But along the way,

732
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,030
I found that among all races,

733
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,800
there is still kindness.

734
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,200
There are countless beings

735
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,610
steadfastly upholding justice and their purpose.

736
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,710
They shouldn't be destroyed this way,

737
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,830
nor should the world end this way.

738
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,180
But the Outlander King's Sword is already broken.

739
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,760
Even if you have the Divine Bow,

740
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,370
you don't have usable arrows.

741
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,300
With just this trace of spiritual power left in you,

742
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,620
your journey

743
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,250
could very easily end in death.

744
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,850
In this world,

745
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,760
it's not always about being certain of success

746
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,860
or guaranteeing that nothing will go wrong before we take action.

747
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,950
Many times, we may not have the upper hand

748
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,590
or any certainty of success,

749
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,870
but we still risk it all

750
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,480
to protect

751
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,940
what matters to us,

752
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,240
don't we?

753
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,790
Everyone has their own responsibilities to fulfil.

754
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,740
Though the physical form of deity Xing Yue may have perished,

755
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,860
its Divine Mantle remains undiminished.

756
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,190
Perhaps, it's also for this very purpose.

757
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,870
Bai Shuo.

758
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,630
Tian Huo.

759
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,290
You've never feared death,

760
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,710
whether it was for Fan Yue

761
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,570
or Bright Moon Palace.

762
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,920
You definitely would know

763
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,110
and understand this feeling.

764
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,970
Right?

765
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,200
Don't worry.

766
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,490
I cherish my life,

767
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,740
and I generally have good luck.

768
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,440
I won't die so easily.

769
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,390
Tian Huo.

770
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,230
It has been my honor

771
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,980
to have known you

772
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,630
and journeyed with you.

773
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,760
Thank you

774
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,440
for everything along the way.

775
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,640
If I ever make it back,

776
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,690
let's have a drink together.

777
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,850
Bai Shuo is here.

778
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,250
She really came.

779
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,170
I didn't expect her to come.

780
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,250
You really came.

781
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,360
What?

782
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,320
Did Fan Yue not stop you?

783
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,680
Or is he simply too weak to stop you?

784
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,060
Let them go.

785
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,320
Both the Eternals and demons have never been nice to you.

786
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,670
They either look down on you

787
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,220
or have been itching to fight or kill you.

788
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,220
And yet, you still want to save them?

789
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,570
There's no need for all this nonsense.

790
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,520
You set the terms,

791
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,180
and I showed up as agreed.

792
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,860
I have done what I needed to do.

793
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,740
You should keep your promise too.

794
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,700
Fine.

795
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,430
As long as you promise me one thing,

796
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,070
I will spare all of them.

797
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,180
Bai Shuo.

798
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,530
Don't believe him.

799
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,650
Mo Li is ruthless.

800
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,370
He won't give up so easily.

801
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,030
How noisy.

802
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,740
Where did they go?

803
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,680
Don't worry.

804
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,370
They went back to where they came from.

805
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,210
Their lives are mine

806
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,090
to take at any moment, anyway.

807
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,680
What do you want me to do?

808
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
The wedding that was left unfinished 60,000 years ago

809
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,070
should now be completed.

810
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm not Xing Yue.

811
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,000
It doesn't matter.

812
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,710
I just want to finish

813
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,860
what I didn't finish 60,000 years ago.

814
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,150
So regardless whether you are Xing Yue or not,

815
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,490
simply just with your face,

816
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,340
I must marry you.
