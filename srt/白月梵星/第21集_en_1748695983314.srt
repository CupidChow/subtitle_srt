1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Full Romeo

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
Part 4

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm willing to be as good as a star, as good as a moon.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are in this world.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What is the flower that never came to the end?

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What is the flower that never came to the end?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is the flower that never came to the end?

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I only want to watch every star day with the one I love.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a book.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You and her are not the same person.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Did you ever know that there is a star?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am willing to be as good as a star.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I only want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The fairy demon is a book.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You and her are not the same person.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is the flower that never came to the end?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The night is silent.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The heartless light

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is a light.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Life is a reality.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The flower in the wind

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is in the water.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We live together.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We die together.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The night is silent.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The night is silent.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Young Master, why didn't you tell Chongzhao about the seal?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I didn't see the seal as soon as it was shed.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going back to the cold spring tomorrow.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't be so naive.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I understand.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I won't tell you.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But today, in the lake,

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Young Master can kill that white-haired man.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why did you keep your hand?

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I didn't keep my hand.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's because I saw that short knife.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not the first time you've seen that short knife.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But it's the first time I feel that short knife

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is familiar.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I also saw some pictures.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I always feel like

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've seen that knife before.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What pictures?

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't remember.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Young Master, you're in a daze again.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're in a hallucination again.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you sick?

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hallucination?

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Young Master, don't worry.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll go back to the cold spring tomorrow.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go find Chenye.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Although he's bad,

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he has good medicine in his hand.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He must have a medicine with a headache.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Tomorrow,

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll go back to the cold spring.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The sword is the most important thing.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I just want to make myself stronger.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That way, I won't drag the people around me.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In the city, I caused you to fall.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now, I'm in a daze again.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's my own choice.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's not just for you.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Tianhuang,

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
what's the matter with the daze?

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You don't have to be so hard.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I understand.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
At that time, you were in the Dragon Crescent Mirror.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You saved me from the daze.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now, I sacrifice myself for everyone.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the feelings he saved

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
are the same as the feelings of the owner.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Without the grudge,

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't want to repay you.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Am I right?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This world is the most terrible.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm with you in my heart.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can only be this little fox.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The daze is in my heart.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's in everyone's heart.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've already passed through the mountains.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now, the trees are growing.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The foxes are growing.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They will remember

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that the daze used its life

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to spread the future for them.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What about the little girl?

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
She has been trapped for thousands of years.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now, the trees are in danger.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She's lost her way.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She's lost her way.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This time,

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
she still chose to stay.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You all

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
left yourself here

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but you didn't tell me anything in advance.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is a gift from you.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know what I can do to protect you again.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not satisfied with what I think.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
From now on

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll be in the fox tribes

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
to come and watch you.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Until I'm Emperor QiXiao.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
May you never leave the village.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
May you be so kind.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you don't recognize me

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I won't be your Savубil beaten.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I won't go back anymore.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The ditzy heures are stopping.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,880
..ishye's people and his heart.

125
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,180
Then I have a backlase with the song..

126
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,220
..and love from this town!

127
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I've wished to�� not the sleep or responsibility of my life.

128
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,360
This journey doesn't end here.

129
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,140
I'll stay here with you.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
After Linglong died, I never saw this Jin Yong Mountain.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now I see that our family is so beautiful.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This time, he willingly stayed in the Lake Tribe to look after the tree.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He didn't force it, he didn't have any grudge.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He only did what he really wanted.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you can be happy, I will be happy too.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I hope that the sacrifice of Mu Jiu is worth it.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Not only can Hu and Changmei get the new life,

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but also hope that Ruo Shui Shi can bring you a bigger life.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not that you and the owner are trapped in this.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is what Mu Jiu wishes.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mu Jiu wishes too.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Firefly, thank you.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mu Jiu

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Come, come with me.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm tired

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But this girl saved me in a chaos.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you want, I can think about it.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm here not to be a free worker.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll be fine every time I cook for my wife.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can look after me.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hu, I really like you.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
When you look at me, my heart is in love.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When I touch the love, it will open up the love flower.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The world is big, and I'm far away.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Promise me, no matter what happens in the future,

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
just like now, keep on being happy.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Come out.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I...

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I just want to make you happy.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not unhappy.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just left.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You don't have to do this in the future.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I just want to do what I'm told.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What did he tell you?

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He stopped me at the forest that day.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He stopped me at the forest that day.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why are you so broad?

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why are you blocking me?

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Dai Shidou, promise me something.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If I'm not here,

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
take good care of A Huo for me.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Do you hear me?

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You said it.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dong Hua,

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you're not here.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where are you going?

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A Huo is a man.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He doesn't care about anything on the surface.

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But he's the most important.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's stubborn and strong.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can be more careful in the future.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm leaving.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't want to take the risk.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I just want you to be happy.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I know you've always been in my heart.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I heard everything you said.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You said it.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I know you haven't given up.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Cang Shan,

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
thank you.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll walk out slowly.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Isn't this your place?

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Follow me.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Those names represent

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the people of the Palace.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Greetings, everyone.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know...

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When you were in the 7 Star Fire,

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tian Huo told me that

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
these are all your people.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If they're still alive,

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
they'll love you.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is my aunt.

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is my brother.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's bullying me.

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Everyone is here.

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They're all here to force me to become a person.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No one knows who I am.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No one knows where I come from.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's because they don't know

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that the Bai Ze family in the past

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
had been killed by the Bai Ze family.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Bai Ze family?

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I want to tell you my story.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay?

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you're too sad,

218
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you can talk later.

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now,

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I just want to tell you.

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ten years ago,

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was born in the mountains.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I fell from the cliff.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I saved my life.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I lost my memory.

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When I woke up,

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was the grandson of the Bai Ze family.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I had a brother.

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
His name was Qi Feng.

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Soon, I became a member of the family.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Although my life was very ordinary,

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was still a child.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But one day,

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the tiger tribe was forced into the city.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They trapped all the Bai Ze family.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They asked my father

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to have a child.

238
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll say it again.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Give that child to the son of Dai You.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Everyone is here.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can have a look.

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What kind of child is Dai Zitong?

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Child?

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If you don't have it,

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
then kill him.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you kill him,

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you'll be punished.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Kill him.

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Stop it.

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll teach you.

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll teach you.

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Father.

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Aunt.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why?

255
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Qi Feng.

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Qi Feng.

257
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Aunt.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why?

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Qi Feng.

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Qi Feng.

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now, the child is found.

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The Bai Ze family.

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Kill them.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The tiger tribe found the child.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They still want to kill the whole family.

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Then how did you

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
survive?

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That day,

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the Bai Ze family was killed.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The tiger tribe thought we were dead.

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So they killed them.

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll teach you.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Aunt.

274
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Aunt.

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Aunt.

276
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Aunt.

277
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Aunt.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Aunt.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Aunt.

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Aunt.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Aunt.

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Aunt.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Your life

284
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is more important than you think.

285
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And the Bai Ze family is more important than you think.

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Aunt.

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Bai Ze, you must

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
live well.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Aunt.

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Aunt.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Aunt.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Aunt.

293
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Aunt.

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Aunt.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Aunt.

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Aunt.

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Aunt.

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I was so angry

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that aunt gave me the power to kill him.

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's why I was killed.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So,

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you were so angry that

303
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you killed the seven stars.

304
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Did you get your revenge?

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When I finally became stronger,

307
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the tiger tribe was gone.

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Qi Feng didn't know what to do.

309
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm afraid he's dead.

310
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's been a long time.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I remember it every time.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm here.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Aunt.

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Qi Feng.

315
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He's Bai Shuo.

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He's the one I like.

317
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm here to see you today.

318
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I've seen you before,

319
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and I've seen you last time.

320
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I've seen you before,

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and I've seen you last time.

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know who you are.

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Please forgive me.

325
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm the one who likes Fan Yue.

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't worry.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll be by her side

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to take care of her

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and protect her.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I won't let her get sick.

331
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I won't let her get hurt.

332
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I won't let her be sad.

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll be by her side

334
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and walk with her forever.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've brought you here today

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to tell you everything I want to tell you.

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I want you to understand that

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm your family.

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No matter what difficulties you face in the future,

340
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll face them all with you.

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So you don't have to be responsible for my fall.

342
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's for your and mine's sake.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But Xinmei,

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you'll die.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You'll die for the rest of your life.

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Isn't this what you used to say?

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Fan Yue, don't joke around.

348
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm not joking.

349
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I want to live with you,

350
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
not to talk about the loss,

351
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but to live with you.

352
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay?

353
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
When you put love in my heart,

354
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
when my heart is only for you.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When you put love in my heart,

356
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
you lost your closest friend.

357
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
From a young man to a demon now,

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
you only saw your eyes and eyes and eyes.

359
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But you don't know how much you've suffered

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
after this.

361
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It doesn't matter.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Those tears and tears

363
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
have gone away.

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No, it hasn't.

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The seven stars are not gone.

366
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
How can you be at peace?

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Fan Yue,

368
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll work hard to be strong

369
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and be as fast as I can.

370
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You'll live as you wish.

371
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll live as I wish.

372
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Master,

373
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
this trip to Youshan

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
can be a good memory.

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But I didn't expect

376
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Bai Shuo to take the sword

377
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
from the King of Yi

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and lead the people to fail.

379
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If it wasn't for the help of the army,

380
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Fulin might have lost his life.

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You said that

382
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you were defeated by Fan Yue

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and you've recovered your spiritual power.

384
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Now that you're defeated by Youshan,

385
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you said that because of Bai Shuo,

386
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
you've taken out the God Sword.

387
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You have so many excuses.

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But you only have one life.

389
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Fulin said that

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
he refused to take the sword.

391
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He wouldn't dare to take it.

392
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Princess,

393
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Fulin said that

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the wound on Chongzhao's body

395
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
was caused by the King of Yi's sword.

396
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can check it out.

397
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There are five years of time

398
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
in Bai Shuo's body

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to urge the God Sword.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's not enough.

401
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's you.

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You and Bai Shuo are acquaintances.

403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You still can't bring her back.

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Master,

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not ready to complete the task.

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Fulin is willing to take the punishment.

407
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I only ask that you

408
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
give me the God Sword

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and let Fulin take the revenge.

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
One of you took the sword

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and the other took the revenge.

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's really touching.

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I just don't know

414
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
how many points

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and how many points.

416
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What do you want to say?

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I went to the human clan some days ago.

418
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Guess who I met?

419
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The Golden Thunder of Lanling.

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The Golden Thunder brought me to the city of Xun.

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It was a great thing.

422
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I've never been to a Cold-Wedged Palace.

423
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It was only a snake

424
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
that could see me from the Cold-Wedged Palace.

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Chongzhao,

426
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
do you think

427
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
this is a coincidence?

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Lanling is a good person.

429
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
As a few people,

430
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it's normal to be on the first floor.

431
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I've never been to a Cold-Wedged Palace.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But I've been to the Cold-Wedged Palace for a long time.

433
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The Golden Thunder brought me to the city of Xun

434
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and I'm also in the process of the punishment.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you have any doubts,

436
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Chongzhao will handle it.

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If you have any doubts,

438
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll be the one to handle it.

439
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright.

440
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't want to see

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
this kind of coincidence again.

442
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You can leave first.

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I have something to say to Fulin.

444
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You're not curious at all

445
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
why Master left only him.

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Do you think that Cold-Wedged Palace is a place?

447
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If you can't finish the task,

448
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
you'll have to be punished.

449
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Why do you say so much to me?

450
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He's dead every time.

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Why should I do it?

452
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's really a misunderstanding.

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's true.

454
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If he didn't do it,

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
how could you betray him?

456
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If so, you'd just wait and see.

457
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
See if he's not so pitiful

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and pitiful.

459
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No.

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He never is pitiful.

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He'll be even worse

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
if he's angry.

463
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I said

464
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't care

465
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
how he is.

466
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll leave you alone

467
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and give you a chance to talk.

468
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I've finished

469
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
what Fulin said.

470
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Since you have nothing to say,

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I won't force you.

472
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
This is

473
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
a new bowl of food.

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll give it to you.

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Eat it.

476
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What?

477
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You don't like it?

478
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I can forgive your failed task,

479
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but I won't allow you to give up.

480
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I ask you

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
if you really want to return to the cold world.

482
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Master, do you still not believe him?

483
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It doesn't matter

484
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
to me.

485
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
A red-hot can't turn a big wave.

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I want you

487
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
to be the one to be the one.

488
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Now

489
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you've given up your love

490
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and lost your heart.

491
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Maybe one day

492
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
you'll give up your betrayal.

493
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Instead of waiting until that day,

494
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
why don't you just

495
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
give up your regrets now?

496
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Master saved me, raised me, and taught me.

497
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I gave everything to you

498
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
in my heart.

499
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
No one can compare to you.

500
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Fine.

501
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Let him be your wife.

502
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll believe you.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I believe

504
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
you won't betray me.

505
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This medicine

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
can't be stopped

507
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
once it's used.

508
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
If you stop using it,

509
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the pain will be removed

510
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
every day.

511
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
After the medicine is cured,

512
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
it will be more effective.

513
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Remember,

514
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you can't let it go.

515
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You can't let it go.

516
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can't let it go.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You can't let it go.

518
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You can't let it go.

519
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Now you're dead.

520
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'll take your life.

521
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can take it back anytime.

522
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Since you've done

523
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
the wrong thing,

524
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you can go and take the punishment.

525
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Thank you, master.

526
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Did the owner of the house

527
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
personally serve you?

528
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I made it last time.

529
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Last time,

530
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
when I was in the White House,

531
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I was the first to be promoted.

532
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Have a try.

533
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's delicious.

534
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's sweet and tender.

535
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What's wrong?

536
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Before,

537
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Xi also liked

538
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
this kind of taste.

539
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Xi?

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You've been missing for a long time.

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You know her?

542
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
In Ning'an City,

543
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you were suspicious.

544
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You and your family

545
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
have been missing for a long time.

546
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You're now in the city.

547
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What's wrong?

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This short knife

549
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
is a birthday gift

550
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
from Xi.

551
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Actually, I can take care of a sword now.

552
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But I still

553
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
will take this short knife with me

554
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
for the rest of my life.

555
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
After she left the house,

556
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
she never came back?

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
No.

558
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Xi and I grew up together.

559
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm like a father.

560
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
She's gentle and gentle.

561
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
After my mother passed away,

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I was only two years older than her.

563
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But she took care of me

564
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
like a mother.

565
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This dress is so beautiful.

566
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This one is also very beautiful.

567
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yes, it's very beautiful.

568
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's ugly.

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
One year after the wedding,

570
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I had to go out to play.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But you didn't have me.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So you went to the lantern party with me.

573
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That night,

574
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we met a monster

575
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and got caught in a trap.

576
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Fortunately,

577
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
the monster was saved by Yue Ying Hai.

578
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
After a long time,

579
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Xi suddenly had a big illness.

580
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He was in a terrible condition.

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He was helpless.

582
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
At that time,

583
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
my father and I

584
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
had forgotten.

585
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Until a tourist passed by Nian Cheng

586
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and saved her.

587
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The tourist went to the high court.

588
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
He said that if she wants to heal,

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
she must follow her to the world.

590
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
She needs to heal every day.

591
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
My father was really helpless.

592
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Xi.

593
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He had to take her away.

594
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Xi.

595
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But he never

596
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
knew about it.

597
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Xi.

598
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I rarely mention Xi.

599
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But I know that

600
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
he secretly sent people

601
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
to find her many times.

602
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If I hadn't been so kind,

603
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Xi wouldn't have left the family

604
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and lost her family.

605
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You were still young then.

606
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You didn't know what would happen.

607
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's not your fault.

608
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Can I see my sister again

609
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
in my whole life?

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No.

611
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Trust me.

612
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Miss.

613
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Miss.

614
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You are a poison.

615
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Why are you still eating?

616
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If I don't take the medicine,

617
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will be poisoned

618
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
by the way you gave me.

619
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
What should I do?

620
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will go find someone to help you.

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No.

622
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No one will help me.

623
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't need anyone to help me.

624
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Remember.

625
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Once you beg for mercy

626
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
in the cold cold,

627
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you will be sentenced to death

628
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
for being a weak person.

629
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The result of being weak

630
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
is death.

631
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes.

632
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Young Master.

633
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't want you to die.

634
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You don't want you to be a weak person.

635
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Why are you out?

636
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I came to see

637
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
who is so tough

638
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and connected to you secretly.

639
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Didn't we agree?

640
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We have to take all the way together.

641
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I want to be the one

642
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
who can fight with you.

643
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So I can't live

644
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
in this world.

645
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't want to be your sister.

646
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't want to be your sister.

647
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't want to be your sister.

648
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't want to be your sister.

649
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't want to be your sister.

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Then I have to take this military escort.

651
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You can do it.

652
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Legendary general,

653
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,900
you are with the powerful

654
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,400
and powerful

655
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,000
and strong

656
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,400
people

657
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
from all over China.

658
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,020
So I mustidd

659
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,000
protect you and your promise

660
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,220
and maintained you剝le the big toe.

661
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,840
I know.

662
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,920
But during the process

663
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
ofitis and heart disease,

664
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I don't feel any difference now.

665
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:26,500
amount

666
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Ling Li?

667
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
You are a spiritual spirit.

668
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
You can feel your power

669
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
like a single sky.

670
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Then you can see the stars in the clouds.

671
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
This is Ling Li.

672
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
It's my own Ling Li.

673
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
You couldn't rest in the demon group.

674
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
So I sent you to the old man's place to worship the spirit.

675
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
But there is one thing I can teach you.

676
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
What?

677
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Fight with the strongest.

678
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
If you are not in a hurry,

679
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
use the fastest speed

680
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
to get out of the darkness and attack the light.

681
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
As long as you can catch his only blow,

682
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
you will be the one to be hit.

683
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
You will be the killer.

684
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Ling Li.

685
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Ling Li.

686
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Ling Li.

687
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
If you can beg for life in death,

688
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
you will be defeated.

689
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
But what if my opponent is Zhen Yu?

690
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
He is the same.

691
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
But this is just a trick.

692
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
He is strong and strong.

693
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Even if I find his blow,

694
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I can't break his fate.

695
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
But don't forget.

696
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
You still have the power to be fearless.

697
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
When you gather all your power

698
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
to this one thing,

699
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
let alone Zhen Yu,

700
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
even if I have the chance,

701
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
you will have the chance to fight.

702
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Really?

703
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
It's not easy to win the demon with a human.

704
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
But you have to remember

705
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
the feeling and move

706
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
and the strength of the spirit.

707
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
As long as you practice hard,

708
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
you will be invincible.

709
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
One day,

710
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
even if you are the one to be hit,

711
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
you will be able to fight.

712
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You just believe that I can do it?

713
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
You have given me

714
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
too much surprise

715
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
on this journey.

716
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I believe that

717
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
it has nothing to do with the Five-year-old.

718
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
It has nothing to do with the King's Sword.

719
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
But you have been believed by the left.

720
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Fengyu,

721
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
thank you.

722
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
How can I thank you?

723
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Thank you.

724
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
No.

725
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
No.

726
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Do you think that

727
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
the Cold Palace is a place

728
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
where the King can be punished

729
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
if he doesn't fulfill his mission?

730
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Chongzhao! Chongzhao!

731
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Chongzhao,

732
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
go and save Young Lord.

733
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Fulin?

734
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
He was punished by the Princess

735
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
and was in the dark room.

736
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Ning'an City, Yicheng, and Jingyou Mountain

737
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
were saved and helped by Young Lord.

738
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
He also helped you

739
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
to fulfill the mission.

740
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,020
Young Lord gave you the Demon Flower

741
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,500
and you were able to

742
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
make it through the process.

743
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Without the Demon Flower and the Bone,

744
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
he would have been punished

745
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
more than before.

746
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
But his heart,

747
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
even if it hurts,

748
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
he won't beg for it.

749
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Chongzhao,

750
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
are you really going to die?

751
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
He is more powerful than me.

752
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I am as far as he is now.

753
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
You...

754
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Do you think

755
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
you can live with the Princess?

756
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Young Lord asked for his life in front of the Princess.

757
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
He took you away from the palace

758
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
and saved your life.

759
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
He forced you to save you.

760
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
I don't understand

761
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
why Young Lord

762
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
is torturing you.

763
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Now I understand.

764
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
You are not so good.

765
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Young Lord has been living in a poor way.

766
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
He will bring you

767
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
the warmth and treasure

768
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
that he has brought to you.

769
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
He will kill the Princess

770
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
and he will be punished

771
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
for it.

772
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Chongzhao,

773
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
you don't know that Young Lord likes you.

774
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
I hate you.

775
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Congratulations, Young Lord.

776
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
You have successfully trained Chongzhao.

777
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
From now on,

778
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
the two worlds of the first demon

779
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
will be destroyed.

780
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I will kill you.

781
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
You are so quick-witted.

782
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
It seems that

783
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
the plan is ready.

784
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
I can't

785
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
even look at you

786
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
with my eyes.

787
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
You have been to Anchou.

788
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
You have been to the palace.

789
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
You can only

790
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
remember your life

791
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
after you know it.

792
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Young Lord,

793
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I beg your leave.

794
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
I will send a big gift to you

795
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
and bring it back to you.

796
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Don't be like Fulin.

797
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Let me down.

798
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I have no regrets.

799
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I will do my best.

800
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I will do my best.

801
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Tianhu,

802
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I need you to do something.

803
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Please speak, Your Highness.

804
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you know about Bai Xi?

805
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
What you said is

806
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
the daughter of the mastermind.

807
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
When you asked me

808
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
to investigate the Bai family,

809
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I asked about some things about Bai Xi.

810
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
It was said that

811
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
he was a member of the family.

812
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
You want to help Bai Shou

813
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
to find Bai Xi?

814
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Yes.

815
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
What are you laughing at?

816
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
You used to be good to Bai Shou.

817
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
You were ignorant and hidden.

818
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Congratulations, Your Highness.

819
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
You finally understand

820
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
your feelings

821
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
and you dare to express your feelings.

822
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
But

823
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
the Bai family has been searching for Bai Xi for ten years.

824
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
It seems that the Ning'an city

825
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
and the surrounding town

826
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
have been changed.

827
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
If you want to find Bai Xi,

828
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
you should go somewhere far away.

829
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Maybe it was a clue

830
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,500
to take away his Taoism.

831
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I will go to the city tonight.

832
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Tonight?

833
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

834
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I have something to do.

835
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
I am better than being alone

836
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
in the room.

837
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
I am too idle.

838
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I can't keep my mind idle.

839
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I will always think of

840
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
some things and some people.

841
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Tianhu.

842
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Don't worry, Your Highness.

843
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Time will balance a lot of things.

844
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
As long as you give me some time,

845
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I will definitely

846
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
become the Tianhu I used to be.

847
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Don't force yourself to become the Tianhu I used to be.

848
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Any time Tianhu

849
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
is the best Tianhu.

850
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Time doesn't balance everything.

851
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I have myself.

852
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Go back and rest.

853
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I will do it.

854
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
The demon king is about to be heartbroken.

855
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
When did I ever feel heartbroken?

856
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Master, why are you here?

857
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I am not here.

858
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
My baby bunny

859
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,500
is really going to be taken away by someone.

860
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
What?

861
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Do you have any idea?

862
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Don't scare my master.

863
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Yes.

864
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
It's okay, bunny.

865
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
The demon king of the heaven,

866
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,500
the princess of the hell,

867
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
is so sick and sick

868
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
that you are eating her.

869
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Raise your hand.

870
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
What?

871
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
What?

872
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
She is pregnant.

873
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Look at her.

874
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Do you have any idea

875
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
whether she is pregnant or not?

876
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Don't worry.

877
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I am not only healthy,

878
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
but also spiritual.

879
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
Spiritual?

880
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
How is it?

881
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Am I

882
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
as pure as spiritual?

883
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I am not limited.

884
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Don't be so happy.

885
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
The old saying is

886
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
that you are like a fire.

887
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
What do you mean?

888
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
You have been hurt by your life every time.

889
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
The five-spice stone

890
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
will open itself to the power

891
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
and protect your life.

892
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
It's like a golden stick,

893
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
but it also greatly damages your body.

894
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Now,

895
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
the weak water stone

896
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
protects your body,

897
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
and also can cure the five-spice stone.

898
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
I am afraid that

899
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
your golden stick

900
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
will be gone.

901
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Can I

902
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
use the power of the five-spice stone?

903
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Yes, you can.

904
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
But it's not enough

905
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
to protect this work.

906
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
If you are famous in the future,

907
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,500
you can only use

908
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
your own ability to draw the world.

909
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I thought it was a big deal.

910
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
It's good to have the power

911
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,500
of the five-spice stone.

912
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I don't want it to protect me.

913
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Don't worry.

914
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I won't hurt him again.

915
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
I will be relieved

916
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
if you say so.

917
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Good boy.

918
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
This is the medicine

919
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
I have been practicing recently.

920
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
I have brought it all for you.

921
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Remember,

922
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
eat more if you are free.

923
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Don't be upset.

924
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I will give you a discount every day.

925
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Master.

926
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
It's not easy

927
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
to leave a secret.

928
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,500
You should go back.

929
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Remember, take good care of yourself.

930
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Take good care of yourself.

931
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
The five-spice stone...

932
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
I know what you want to say.

933
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Don't worry.

934
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
I have lived

935
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
for twenty years

936
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
without the five-spice stone.

937
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
It's the same in the future.

938
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I still want to be with you.

939
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
I will walk on forever.

940
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,500
The one standing in the distance

941
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Don't be afraid

942
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,500
My heart will only be yours

943
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Come to me

944
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:31,500
My heart is so excited

945
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Wait for me

946
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
My heart is so cold

947
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,500
You are my eyes

948
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,500
You are the light I want to forget

949
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,500
It's the lonely way

950
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Let this moment be with you

951
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Let this love be with you

952
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I will wait for you

953
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,500
You are my life's blue soil

954
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Let this rain and the storm

955
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Let tears be filled

956
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Let this life be with you

957
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I'll be with you
