1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimesâ€¦

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 29]

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
We came to the village

20
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,150
to find someone.

21
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,240
Has anyone else entered the village

22
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,650
recently besides us?

23
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,430
Well...

24
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,850
My disciple.

25
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,400
Master.

26
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,780
Are you okay?

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,540
I'm fine.

28
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,520
Of course.

29
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,460
How can I not be fine?

30
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,280
It's all thanks to Ms. Luan Zhu for saving me yesterday.

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,530
She was also willing to take me in.

32
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,040
Ms. Luan Zhu, thank you for saving my Master.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
I will protect

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,780
anyone who enters Bodhi Village

35
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,020
as long as they are kind.

36
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,079
No need to thank me.

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,650
Since Master has been found,

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,930
we won't disturb you further.

39
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,810
Goodbye.

40
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,360
It's getting dark.

41
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,620
Why are you leaving?

42
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,870
The village is beautiful

43
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,829
and has delicious food and wine.

44
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,140
Accompany me here for a few more days.

45
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,620
Divine Maiden, you won't mind

46
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,870
having two more guests, right?

47
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,530
Bodhi Village welcomes guests.

48
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,260
You can stay as long as you want.

49
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,690
Compared to your room,

50
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,820
my room is too shabby.

51
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,190
She's treating you youngsters so well.

52
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,920
That's not the case.

53
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,750
She treats us so well

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,940
because of the Master of Bright Moon.

55
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,940
No, it's not like that...

56
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,600
What is it then?

57
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,230
Your eyes never moved away

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,200
from Luan Zhu just now.

59
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,730
It's getting late.

60
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm so sleepy.

61
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,550
I'm going to sleep.

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,550
Master.

63
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,790
I have something to ask you.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,310
What?

65
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,060
Let's go.

66
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll open the door for you.

67
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,730
Why does she have

68
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,390
the bracelet of the woman in Jing Yuan's memory?

69
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,800
Could they really have been a couple?

70
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,670
I must get to the bottom of this.

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,890
Otherwise, I can't explain it to Shuo.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,410
My disciple,

73
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,180
I've told you

74
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,970
men are untrustworthy.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,730
Since you're safe now,

76
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,220
why didn't you tell me?

77
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you know how worried I was the entire day?

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't be angry.

79
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,100
I was really in danger yesterday.

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,110
Zhen Yu chased me halfway across the Eastern Continent.

81
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,680
It was so dangerous this entire journey.

82
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,690
Luckily, Ms. Luan Zhu saved me.

83
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,659
I think Bodhi Village is very fresh.

84
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,520
I forgot because I was having fun.

85
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,860
How could Zhen Yu hunt you down?

86
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,250
Lanling has a mountain protector barrier

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,370
and he's injured.

88
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,210
How could he break through the barrier?

89
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,760
It's all my fault for being careless.

90
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,690
I've picked all the spiritual herbs at the back of Lanling,

91
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,450
so I thought

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,150
to look for new herbs around Lanling.

93
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,950
But not long after I exited the barrier,

94
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,080
Zhen Yu found me.

95
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,070
So I went east

96
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,920
and ran here.

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,690
Why did he want to kill you?

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,830
You two have a feud?

99
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,860
It's not a big deal.

100
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,860
Many years ago, he came to me for divination

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,790
and I lied to him.

102
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,980
He got angry

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,530
and came to give me trouble.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,780
It's just a trivial matter.

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,900
Forget it.

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,310
Lanling is the head of Eternals.

107
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,530
Instead of hiding here,

108
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,070
you should go back to Lanling.

109
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,910
I can't go back.

110
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,890
I've calculated

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,050
that Lanling will have a catastrophe.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
A catastrophe?

113
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,770
What catastrophe?

114
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,030
I don't know exactly.

115
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,790
Anyway, it's the best here.

116
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,920
We have the protection of Divine Maiden Luan Zhu

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,680
and Bodhi Village can't be found outside.

118
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
This is the safest place.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,490
Safest, my foot.

120
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,159
If you insist on staying here,

121
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,710
I think I'll have a catastrophe.

122
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,220
You...

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,070
What catastrophe can you have?

124
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,750
Did you really not see it

125
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,190
or are you pretending?

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,340
The Luan Zhu is coveting Fan Yue.

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,280
Master, let me ask you.

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,370
What exactly is this Bodhi Village?

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,920
Who is Luan Zhu?

130
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,720
I've never heard of

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,430
this Bodhi Village before either.

132
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,160
I only know

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,230
people here call Luan Zhu the Divine Maiden.

134
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,480
She has lived for a very, very long time.

135
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,220
I heard that

136
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,360
she's waiting for a lover

137
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,860
from 60,000 years ago to return.

138
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,970
60,000 years ago?

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,080
if Luan Zhu has something to do with the Divine Race

140
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,680
and Fan Yue has a Demon Lord's Divine Mantle...

141
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,840
What if they really...

142
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,020
What?

143
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,510
Demon Lord's Divine Mantle?

144
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,070
What do you mean?

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,970
Since you came to see me,

146
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,680
why don't you say anything?

147
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,250
Who are you?

148
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,370
What is your relationship with Jing Yuan?

149
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
Have you really forgotten

150
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,630
about our century together

151
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,990
in the ancient Divine Region and the days

152
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,390
in Xing Yue Pavilion?

153
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,100
After the purple eyes returned,

154
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,610
some images indeed flashed past my mind.

155
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,080
But I knew

156
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,160
those were Jing Yuan's memories.

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,810
In those memories, there was a woman.

158
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,310
I couldn't see her face,

159
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,830
but I saw her bracelet.

160
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,870
It's just like the bracelet on your wrist.

161
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,880
So you came to me

162
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,890
not because you thought of me,

163
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,110
but only because of this bracelet.

164
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,890
I don't want to hurt you,

165
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,520
but looking at the current situation,

166
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,940
you're in danger.

167
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,610
All signs indicate

168
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,260
Luan Zhu and Jing Yuan were a couple before.

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
So you mean

170
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,470
I'm the third party?

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,980
I shouldn't be with Fan Yue?

172
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,740
I didn't say that.

173
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,270
The love between Luan Zhu and Jing Yuan

174
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,930
was from 60,000 years ago.

175
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,240
Times have changed.

176
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,970
Now, you're the one Fan Yue loves.

177
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,990
Of course I know that.

178
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,850
But Disciple,

179
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,850
because I'm your Master,

180
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,050
I hope you can think some things through.

181
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,090
Although you have spiritual power now,

182
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,920
you're still a human.

183
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,280
You can only live 100 years.

184
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,820
You also said before

185
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,890
Fan Yue has a Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

186
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,430
He has a long lifespan.

187
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,310
Do you think you two are suitable for each other?

188
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,190
Even if you are together,

189
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,240
you'll only be together for decades.

190
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,710
After you pass away,

191
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,910
you can't control

192
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,080
who he gets with.

193
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,790
Do you think

194
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,760
he and Luan Zhu should be a couple?

195
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,680
I don't think so.

196
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,180
I just hope you can be well.

197
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,780
Don't hurt yourself.

198
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,940
Even if Fan Yue isn't strong enough

199
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,040
and falls for someone else,

200
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,820
don't be too sad.

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,630
Men...

202
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,840
There are many men in this world.

203
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,370
He's not the only one.

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,640
60,000 years ago,

205
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,330
you were the Demon Lord Jing Yuan.

206
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,040
I was the Divine Maiden Xing Yue.

207
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,770
We were together for 100 years.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,990
You promised me.

209
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,470
You said you'll always...

210
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,970
Never mind.

211
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,640
You've forgotten

212
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,940
everything.

213
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,330
What's the point

214
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,810
of mentioning "forever"?

215
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,180
I don't remember things

216
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,710
from 60,000 years ago.

217
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
But I know

218
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,980
Bai Shuo is the only one

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,590
that I love now.

220
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,850
I know.

221
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,740
I saw her today.

222
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,720
She's smart

223
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
and spirited.

224
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,860
Looking at her

225
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,120
is like looking at my former self.

226
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,280
But compared to me from before,

227
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,430
she has more courage.

228
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,180
The courage to love.

229
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,800
She is a good girl.

230
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,480
Since you chose her,

231
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,180
you should keep going.

232
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,890
Go back now.

233
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,430
Just forget about this trip.

234
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,390
Go back and live your life.

235
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,780
It's late.

236
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,080
Go back.

237
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,910
Don't let her misunderstand.

238
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,820
It's been 60,000 years.

239
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,190
I finally found you.

240
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,410
This time,

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,640
I won't let anyone else have you.

242
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,020
You finally thought it through.

243
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
Returning to Lanling

244
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,800
is the correct path.

245
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,610
I'm very pleased.

246
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,200
Could it be

247
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,910
you came back to Lanling

248
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,790
for another purpose?

249
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,550
Since my parents died,

250
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
you raised me like my father

251
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,090
and taught me the magic

252
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,260
and laws of the Eternals.

253
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,440
I have never had any selfish intentions toward you.

254
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,680
But today,

255
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,850
I still want to ask you one more question.

256
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Were my parents

257
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,180
really killed by demons?

258
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,780
Are you questioning me?

259
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,020
I dare not.

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,030
But Xi has regained

261
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,220
most of her memories.

262
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,190
She said my mother met her before she died

263
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,640
and asked her to tell me

264
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,390
not to go back to Lanling.

265
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,540
You believe it?

266
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,010
I donâ€™t want to.

267
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,390
But Xi won't lie to me.

268
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,150
The demoness is intentionally sowing discord.

269
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,510
She should be condemned,

270
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,220
while you fell into her trap!

271
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,940
It's my fault.

272
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,140
I shouldn't have sent you to the Cold Spring Palace.

273
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,840
It's my fault.

274
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,870
I should have called you back earlier.

275
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,170
Now you've joined the demoness's side

276
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,390
and regard Lanling as something lowly.

277
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,230
My heart aches.

278
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,820
I never meant that.

279
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,890
But...

280
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,400
It's just that I've never gotten closure

281
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
for my parents' death

282
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,440
Iâ€™ve never forgotten it.

283
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,850
Since you are so obsessed with the truth,

284
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,950
I am

285
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,120
willing to take you to reinvestigate

286
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,210
the cause of your parents' death.

287
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,590
Tell me.

288
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,370
What else did she see?

289
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,880
Any other clues?

290
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,390
She saw another person.

291
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,530
Who?

292
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,710
She stood far away

293
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,910
and didn't see the person clearly.

294
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,400
But she saw with her own eyes

295
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,260
that the person hurt my mother with a sword.

296
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,580
And that day

297
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,310
was the day my parents' soul lanterns extinguished.

298
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,610
What were that person's characteristics?

299
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,880
What technique did he use?

300
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,820
What did he do to your mother?

301
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,900
Does she remember?

302
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,860
Bai Xi was hit from behind

303
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
and passed out.

304
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,640
She doesn't remember much.

305
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,150
How can these

306
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,270
count as clues?

307
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,890
Even if she didn't lie to you,

308
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,260
it's been a long time.

309
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,490
How can you be sure that she didnâ€™t remember incorrectly?

310
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,900
I see.

311
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,620
I apologize

312
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,210
and thank you, Master.

313
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,860
You are busy with work.

314
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,240
Donâ€™t be too upset over my matters.

315
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,880
Take care, Master.

316
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,580
Goodbye.

317
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,170
You...

318
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Are you really going back to her?

319
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,420
Being with her

320
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,010
will only harm you.

321
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,980
She has been alone for too long.

322
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,170
I want to go back to accompany her,

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,770
no matter what is ahead of us.

324
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,370
I went to see Luan Zhu.

325
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,340
And?

326
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,300
She said she's Goddess Xing Yue.

327
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,180
60,000 years ago, she had a relationship

328
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,840
with the Demon Lord Jing Yuan.

329
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,400
What relationship?

330
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,170
Vows as steadfast as mountains and seas,

331
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,020
pledging life and death to each other.

332
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,490
So you knew

333
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,740
all of this before you entered Bodhi Village?

334
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,960
Not entirely.

335
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,110
I just saw some images.

336
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,470
Jing Yuan put a bracelet on a woman,

337
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,970
and that bracelet

338
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,660
was exactly the same as Luan Zhu's.

339
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,000
That's why I went to ask her.

340
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,950
It seems that

341
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,670
they were old friends.

342
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,480
Old friends?

343
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,290
So you were old lovers.

344
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm Fan Yue.

345
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,650
I only have one lover.

346
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,720
It's you.

347
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,480
Your words sound nice,

348
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,600
but you already have

349
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,590
memories and images of her in your mind.

350
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,840
You've started to avoid me.

351
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,630
I avoided you

352
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,150
because I didn't know who she was

353
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,840
or why she appeared in my mind.

354
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,280
Now I know.

355
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,660
That's Jing Yuan's memory.

356
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,890
It has nothing to do with me.

357
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,350
I won't avoid you anymore.

358
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,570
How do you prove that?

359
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,390
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

360
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,760
This way, I won't avoid you again.

361
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,900
â™«You are the light I yearn forâ™«

362
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,060
â™«You are my determined way homeâ™«

363
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,860
Actually, when Jing Yuan saved me back then,

364
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,210
â™«Let this moment stay foreverâ™«

365
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,830
he said one thing.

366
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,850
Not all deities pity mortals.

367
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,339
â™«I'm hugging you in the crowdâ™«

368
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,430
You should be glad

369
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,380
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

370
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,640
your eyes resemble theirs.

371
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,880
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

372
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,829
I didn't know who Jing Yuan was talking about,

373
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,900
or whether they were a man or a woman.

374
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,190
â™«You are the blueprint of my lifeâ™«

375
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,560
Now it seems

376
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,569
it might've been Luan Zhu.

377
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,410
â™«The morning breeze and morning dewâ™«

378
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:28,280
â™«Let the tears celebrateâ™«

379
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,930
That's just Jing Yuan's past.

380
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,859
I, Fan Yue,

381
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,170
will only

382
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,630
â™«We embrace each other in the skyâ™«

383
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,500
love

384
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,860
Bai Shuo

385
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,210
in the past, present, and future.

386
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,920
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

387
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,480
By the way,

388
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,410
Master

389
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,150
still refuses to leave Bodhi Village.

390
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,760
I plan to stay with him for a few days

391
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
to observe things

392
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,980
and leave after confirming everything is okay.

393
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,660
Okay.

394
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
I'll stay with you.

395
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,480
Welcome you two.

396
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,510
Candied haws for you.

397
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,220
Thank you.

398
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,110
Smells so good.

399
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,200
Sir,

400
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,130
how much is this?

401
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,350
It's free.

402
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,420
In Bodhi Village,

403
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,240
we have all kinds of good wine and food.

404
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,880
Eat whatever you want

405
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,780
and drink whatever you want.

406
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,760
No money is needed.

407
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,350
Miss,

408
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,280
this is for free.

409
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,150
Thank you.

410
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,110
You're welcome.

411
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,320
If all the people in the world

412
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,110
could be like the villagers of Bodhi Village,

413
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,190
that'd be great.

414
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,940
Then people wouldn't starve or freeze

415
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,870
and there'd be no famines.

416
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,240
I just feel that

417
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,280
this village is too perfect.

418
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,040
What?

419
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,730
You think something is wrong?

420
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,470
Whenever things look too perfect,

421
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,790
there's always something behind it.

422
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,350
Fan Yue.

423
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,440
After collecting the Five Contemplations

424
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,810
and everything is over,

425
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,500
we can find a place like this

426
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,820
for the rest of our lives

427
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,140
and live a life

428
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,800
without conflict like them.

429
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,310
That's my wish too.

430
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,430
But what matters is

431
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,070
being with you.

432
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,630
Let's go.

433
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,600
It's freshly cooked. Be careful, it's hot.

434
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,470
Take it.

435
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,700
Take care.

436
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,470
Uncle Chong?

437
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,580
Aunt Meng?

438
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,310
Uncle, Aunt,

439
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,350
I really missed you.

440
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,790
Have you been here

441
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,110
for the past 10 years?

442
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,290
Yes.

443
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
We've been hiding here

444
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,290
to avoid being killed.

445
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,440
Who wants to kill you?

446
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,660
Knowing the truth won't do you any good.

447
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,310
All these years,

448
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,670
we've been hiding here.

449
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,890
We don't ask about worldly affairs.

450
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,890
We don't even disturb Chong Zhao.

451
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
Live your life

452
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,380
as if we're already dead.

453
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,780
No way.

454
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,790
For the past 1 years,

455
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,750
Chong Zhao has never given up

456
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,440
on investigating your real cause of death.

457
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,400
He doesnâ€™t believe you were killed by the scorpion demon.

458
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,150
If Chong Zhao knew you are still alive,

459
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,590
he'd be so happy.

460
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,650
Shuo.

461
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,110
Since they have their reasons,

462
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,310
don't force them.

463
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,090
I didn't have time to ask earlier.

464
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,390
Who is this?

465
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,110
This is the Master of Bright Moon Palace, Fan Yue.

466
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,600
He knows Chong Zhao too.

467
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,280
Bright Moon Palace?

468
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,680
When we came here to live in seclusion,

469
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,600
we hadn't heard of Bright Moon Palace.

470
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,260
We haven't left Bodhi Village in 10years.

471
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,900
It seems that

472
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,060
we don't know the outside world anymore.

473
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,200
Things have changed.

474
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,170
Young people

475
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,670
have their own world.

476
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,050
Shuo.

477
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,630
Since we've met again here,

478
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,230
we should treat you well.

479
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,910
I'll make you some delicious food.

480
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,990
Come in.

481
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,550
Come.

482
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,580
Let's go inside.

483
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
Do you think Chong Tai and Meng Ning are weird?

484
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,150
Uncle Chong and Aunt Meng

485
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,670
are the High Eternals of Lanling.

486
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,580
Who could be after them,

487
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,000
[To Chong Zhao]

488
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,090
forcing them to live here in hiding?

489
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,300
They don't even go see Chong Zhao.

490
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,580
There must be something big behind this.

491
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,550
Maybe they'll only tell the truth

492
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,600
if Chong Zhao comes here.

493
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,010
Besides, I've known Chong Zhao for 10 years.

494
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,470
I know how much he canâ€™t let go of his parents.

495
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,130
Iâ€™ll act on my own accord this time.

496
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,540
I hope Chong Zhao can come here soon

497
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,370
and reunite with his parents.

498
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,780
[To Chong Zhao]

499
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,550
[Zhao]

500
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,800
[To Chong Zhao]

501
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,960
Divine Maiden,

502
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,830
we were wrong.

503
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,010
We shouldnâ€™t have let Bai Shuo see us.

504
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,960
We were careless.

505
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,570
Please forgive us.

506
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,240
It's okay to make mistakes,

507
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,620
but if you make a mistake,

508
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,880
you should be punished,

509
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,660
right?

510
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,120
Please show mercy.

511
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,820
We will hide ourselves

512
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,780
so that Bai Shuo won't see us again.

513
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,370
Since the show has started,

514
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,110
how can we end it in a hurry?

515
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,550
Not only should you let Bai Shuo see you,

516
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,250
but also welcome your son Chong Zhao

517
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,430
to Bodhi Village.

518
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,280
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,520
I was too excited just now.

520
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,930
I shouldn't have hurt you.

521
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,590
We are still a loving family.

522
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,490
Will you still listen to me?

523
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,700
We'll always be loyal to the Divine Maiden.

524
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,390
Your son is coming.

525
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
Do you miss him?

526
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,670
No.

527
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,740
He is your biological son.

528
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,050
You haven't seen him in 10 years.

529
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,610
Of course you miss him.

530
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,280
Not only that.

531
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,100
You must also find more information about Bai Shuo

532
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,710
from Chong Zhao.

533
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,090
Understand?

534
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,800
Yes.

535
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,390
That's right.

536
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,130
You've been restless since you came back from Lanling.

537
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,000
You clearly think

538
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,950
Jin Yao is hiding something from you,

539
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,530
but you don't want to believe that.

540
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,470
Master raised me.

541
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,680
I shouldnâ€™t suspect him.

542
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,850
Zhen Yu also raised me.

543
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,060
So what?

544
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,630
If he raised you to use you

545
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,740
and deceive you,

546
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,350
making you view your enemy as your father,

547
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,340
then this kindness

548
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,450
becomes hatred.

549
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,240
I will find out the truth

550
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,360
and I won't have any more concerns.

551
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,510
[I met Uncle Chong and Aunt Meng in the village.]

552
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,510
[Zhao, when searching for Master, Fan Yue and I went chanced upon a village called Bodhi Village.]

553
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,740
What's wrong?

554
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,060
Shuo sent a message.

555
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,630
She said my parents are still alive.

556
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,780
They've been hiding in Bodhi Village all these years.

557
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,070
Bodhi Village?

558
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,220
[I met Uncle Chong and Aunt Meng in the village.]

559
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,220
[Zhao, when searching for Master, Fan Yue and I went chanced upon a village called Bodhi Village.]

560
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,170
I've been travelling everywhere all these years

561
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,810
and I've never heard of this place.

562
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,220
Shuo won't send random messages.

563
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,820
She must have met my parents.

564
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,730
I saw Aunt Meng get stabbed by a sword with my own eyes.

565
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,120
Did someone save her

566
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,740
after I became unconscious?

567
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,240
No matter what,

568
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,450
I want to set off to Bodhi Village immediately.

569
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,020
You can stay here if you don't want to see Shuo

570
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,190
and wait for me to return.

571
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,120
I'll go with you.

572
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,170
You...

573
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Have you figured out how to face her?

574
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,430
I won't hurt her,

575
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,780
but I will never admit that I am Bai Xi.

576
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,930
I respect your decision.

577
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,210
And I won't tell Shuo anything.

578
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,550
But I still want to tell you

579
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,780
that the fact that you are Bai Xi will never change.

580
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,490
One day, you two sisters will reunite.

581
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,280
Xi.

582
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,130
Don't condemn yourself because of the past.

583
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,000
You didn't want to do that either.

584
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,690
You're a victim too.

585
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,950
I believe Shuo will understand you

586
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,060
and feel bad for you.

587
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,340
I'll go pack up.

588
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,500
Then we can go.

589
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,910
Shuo.

590
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,670
You said my parents are in this village.

591
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,070
Is it true?

592
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,960
Why did you bring her here?

593
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,250
It was my idea.

594
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,170
I don't want to

595
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,530
hide anything from her anymore.

596
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,180
Are you really going to be with her from now on?

597
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,120
Yes.

598
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,780
What happened to your parents is more important now.

599
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,350
I won't confront her now,

600
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,630
but one day,

601
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,980
I will settle the debt that she owes.

602
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,900
It's getting late.

603
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,580
Let's go to the village first.

604
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,020
â™«Don't linger, don't regretâ™«

605
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,090
Father,

606
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,490
â™«The last moonlightâ™«

607
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,700
Mother,

608
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,940
I'm back.

609
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,610
-Zhao.
-Zhao.

610
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,060
â™«The water from my hometown flows gentlyâ™«

611
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,860
â™«Sending me to the distant placeâ™«

612
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,560
â™«In this life, at this timeâ™«

613
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,470
Slowly.

614
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,370
â™«I dare not look backâ™«

615
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,370
â™«Is there the same moonlightâ™«

616
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,890
Father.

617
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,600
â™«On your path?â™«

618
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,470
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

619
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,870
Mother.

620
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,380
â™«In the vast world, how can I get there?â™«

621
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,980
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

622
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,730
Zhao.

623
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,460
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

624
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,860
I knew you didn't die.

625
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,700
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

626
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,470
I knew it.

627
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,830
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

628
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,370
I've looked for you for so long.

629
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,340
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

630
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,130
I finally found you.

631
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,270
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

632
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,330
â™«Time after timeâ™«

633
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,410
â™«Oh, melancholyâ™«

634
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:14,960
Come,

635
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,740
Zhao.

636
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,700
Sit down.

637
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,560
Zhao.

638
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,720
You've grown up.

639
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,680
Father.

640
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,690
Mother.

641
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,370
What is this place?

642
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,690
Why didn't you return

643
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,960
to Lanling all these years

644
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,750
or tell me you were still alive?

645
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,960
Zhao,

646
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,730
we're hiding here

647
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,850
for you.

648
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,950
For me?

649
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,300
Back then, we were Eternal Envoys in Ning'an City.

650
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
We often hunted down demons

651
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,280
and made great contributions.

652
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,160
We quickly became well-known.

653
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,330
Not only were we regarded as a powerful enemy by the demons,

654
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,240
but disciples of other Eternal sects

655
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,200
were also jealous of us.

656
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,060
Inevitably, grudges formed with time.

657
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,450
After the last battle with the scorpion demon Qian Yin,

658
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,310
your mother and I should have returned to Lanling to report.

659
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,910
But on our way back,

660
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,100
we were ambushed by other Eternals

661
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,430
and got seriously injured.

662
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,450
At that time, our power was greatly affected.

663
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,960
When we fled to Bodhi Village,

664
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,780
our eternal energy had shattered.

665
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,510
Thanks to the master of this place, we were saved.

666
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,260
When we woke up again,

667
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,870
it was three years later.

668
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
Your eternal energy shattered?

669
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,450
No wonder your soul lantern went out.

670
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,440
But a shattered eternal energy means death.

671
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,220
What power does the master of this place have

672
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,930
that can bring people back to life?

673
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,850
Zhao,

674
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,690
we can't say much.

675
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,980
We can only tell you

676
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,630
the master is very capable.

677
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,900
Thanks to her,

678
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,940
your father and I survived.

679
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,090
We were going to find you as soon as we woke up.

680
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,680
But we heard

681
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,680
Lanling mistakenly thought we were dead

682
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
and you

683
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,230
were taken as a disciple by Sect Leader Jin Yao

684
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,310
and being taken care of by Governor Bai Xun.

685
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,200
What does it have to do with you not coming back to me?

686
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,750
We have too many grudges

687
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,120
and our cultivation has greatly decreased.

688
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,330
If we appear,

689
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,150
someone will take revenge on us.

690
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,040
It's not good for you.

691
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,550
Growing up under the protection of

692
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,520
Sect Leader Jin Yao and Governor Bai Xun

693
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,950
was the safest for you.

694
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,580
Look at me.

695
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,230
I was too busy talking.

696
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,500
I forgot we have guests.

697
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,880
Uncle, Aunt, don't be angry.

698
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,580
I acted on my own this time.

699
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,580
I brought Chong Zhao over

700
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,040
without your permission.

701
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,320
Shuo.

702
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,760
Don't say that.

703
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,130
Thank you.

704
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,880
Thanks to you,

705
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,780
our family is reunited.

706
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,710
We were worried about nothing.

707
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,320
Shuo.

708
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,220
Xi.

709
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,760
You must accompany me today

710
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,120
and have a good time.

711
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,670
Mother.

712
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,840
She's not Xi.

713
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,010
She is my friend,

714
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,260
Fu Ling.

715
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
I'm sorry, miss.

716
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,730
You look kind

717
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,170
and you came with Zhao.

718
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,680
I thought you were...

719
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,440
Ma'am.

720
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,580
Is there anything

721
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,670
I can help you with?

722
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,490
You're a guest.

723
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,030
How can I let you work?

724
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,890
Have a seat

725
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,710
and chat.

726
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,860
I'll cook some delicious food for you.

727
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,590
Sit down and talk.

728
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,030
Make yourself at home.

729
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,070
Do you have any doubts?

730
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,920
No.

731
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,680
What doubts can I have?

732
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,240
Fu Ling.

733
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,700
Fu Ling can't be Xi.

734
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,580
If you have no doubts,

735
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,960
why are you so eager to deny it?

736
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,530
Actually, we did overlook one thing.

737
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,260
For so many years,

738
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,790
Zhen Yu only had two disciples.

739
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,280
One was Qi Feng.

740
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,760
The other was Fu Ling.

741
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,280
Zhen Yu took away the Qi Feng on purpose.

742
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,180
What about Fu Ling?

743
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,430
Why did Zhen Yu

744
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,900
keep Fu Ling by his side?

745
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,290
Back then, Bai Xi was tricked and taken from the Governor's Mansion

746
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,090
by Zhen Yu disguised as a Taoist.

747
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,560
You saw her in Qi Feng's memories too.

748
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,350
Since Zhen Yu tried so hard to take her,

749
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,310
he wouldnâ€™t have killed her for no reason.

750
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,510
If he didn't kill her,

751
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,160
but she disappeared,

752
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
then there is another possibility.

753
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,070
She didn't stay in the Cold Spring Palace

754
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,270
as Bai Xi

755
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,830
but...

756
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,240
It's just a coincidence.

757
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,050
Xi is a human.

758
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,390
Fu Ling is a demon.

759
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,090
She can't be Xi.

760
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,620
Impossible.

761
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,760
Impossible.

762
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,000
There's one more

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
new guest than expected.

764
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,380
Divine Maiden, donâ€™t worry.

765
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,510
Chong Zhao asked many questions today,

766
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,389
but we explained everything.

767
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,340
They shouldn't suspect anything.

768
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,239
"Shouldn't."

769
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,750
The four of them are smart.

770
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,270
It's normal even if they have suspicions.

771
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,469
Don't be afraid.

772
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm not angry.

773
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,420
Since they've entered Bodhi Village,

774
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,750
I won't let them out again.

775
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,699
None can leave.

776
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,780
Wait.

777
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,320
I have something to ask you.

778
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,960
I have nothing to say to you.

779
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,160
Why did you go to the Cold Spring Palace?

780
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,560
When did you arrive at the Cold Spring Palace?

781
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,650
It's none of your business.

782
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,500
I've been thinking

783
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,350
that if Zhen Yu hid Xi like how

784
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,810
he hid Qi Feng's identity,

785
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,770
turning Qi Feng into Chen Ye,

786
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,420
then who would he have turned

787
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,050
my sister Xi into?

788
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,170
Bai Shuo.

789
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,320
You are ridiculous.

790
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Do you think I'm Bai Xi?

791
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,420
Have you forgotten what I've done?

792
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,720
I remember.

793
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,450
I've never forgotten

794
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,180
any of the things

795
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,610
you've done.

796
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,390
So,

797
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,880
how could you

798
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,070
and how dare you have such delusions?

799
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:13,150
â™«What kind of tree never takes root?â™«

800
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,720
Yes.

801
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,820
It's a delusion.

802
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,830
I can't even think about it.

803
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,530
It's a delusion that can never be redeemed.

804
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,340
â™«What kind of roots never turn into trees?â™«

805
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,320
If my Xi is still alive,

806
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,900
if you are her,

807
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,380
I just want to ask why.

808
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:31,500
â™«To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heartâ™«

809
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,370
Why did she become Fu Ling

810
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,630
with so much blood on her hands?

811
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,560
Why did she do all of that to Ning'an City?

812
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:36,860
â™«I'm your wandererâ™«

813
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,020
Why did she try to kill me again and again?

814
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,020
Why did she watch...

815
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,220
Watch Father

816
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:44,180
â™«The flowers flew awayâ™«

817
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,230
die in front of her?

818
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,450
â™«My tears are streaming down like rainâ™«

819
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,150
If you aren't her,

820
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,100
why are you silent?

821
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:02,930
â™«Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the worldâ™«

822
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,480
You care this much about

823
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,730
that Bai Xi who died a long time ago?

824
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,590
You care so much that even if I killed your father,

825
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,080
you'd still rather I be her.

826
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,000
Bai Shuo,

827
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,090
if you really need a family,

828
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,130
â™«On the vast sea, you and Iâ™«

829
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,110
then fine.

830
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,440
Make me the antidote for the Heart Devouring Pill.

831
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,880
Then I can consider being Bai Xi

832
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,010
and grant your wish!

833
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,490
A person like you...

834
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,640
Would never be my Xi.

835
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,890
â™«I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memoriesâ™«

836
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,430
â™«They unfold, one page after anotherâ™«

837
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,560
â™«That year, that yearâ™«

838
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,010
Shuo.

839
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,180
â™«The flowers flew under the moon, filling the skyâ™«

840
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,080
â™«Falling to the mud, burying the memoriesâ™«

841
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,770
â™«Layer after layerâ™«

842
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,430
â™«I remember that moonlit nightâ™«

843
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,500
â™«The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetimeâ™«

844
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,890
â™«I remember that word of concernâ™«

845
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,560
â™«But unfortunately, I didn't get to answerâ™«

846
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,920
â™«I remember that drop of tearâ™«

847
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,660
Xi.

848
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,000
â™«It dried in the windâ™«

849
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,620
It's not your fault.

850
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,390
â™«The one in the autumn windâ™«

851
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,440
Don't do this to yourself.

852
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,500
â™«How many times have I seen you in my dreams?â™«

853
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,510
â™«That year, that yearâ™«

854
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,020
â™«The flowers flew under the moon, filling the skyâ™«

855
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,790
â™«Falling to the mud, burying the memoriesâ™«

856
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,610
â™«Layer after layerâ™«

857
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,970
â™«Another year passedâ™«

858
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,070
â™«Another year passedâ™«

859
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,650
Why are you waiting here?

860
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,220
I know you well.

861
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,770
Since you suspect

862
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,240
Fu Ling is Bai Xi,

863
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,970
with your personality, you'd definitely ask her.

864
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,880
How is it?

865
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,290
What did she say?

866
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,420
I thought too much.

867
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,070
It's impossible that she's Xi.

868
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,110
Is it impossible

869
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,270
or do you not want her to be?

870
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,540
In the past, I thought that since we live in the world,

871
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,420
â™«The person standing far awayâ™«

872
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,990
we can't live our lives in ignorance.

873
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,660
â™«Don't be afraidâ™«

874
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,520
We should get to the bottom of everything

875
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,870
and ask for the truth.

876
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,210
â™«The stars will guide you to meâ™«

877
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,130
But today, I suddenly feel that

878
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:50,690
â™«Walk towards meâ™«

879
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,230
perhaps ignorance isn't a bad thing.

880
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,310
I understand how you feel.

881
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,150
Do you know who you're like now?

882
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,520
Like me when I was

883
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,490
â™«My heart feels so...â™«

884
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,500
facing Qi Feng in the Stone Clan.

885
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,520
â™«It's pounding as I wait for youâ™«

886
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,730
I understand your unease

887
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
and hesitance.

888
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,770
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

889
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,350
Fan Yue,

890
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,580
let's leave here tomorrow.

891
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,090
We came here to find Master.

892
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,010
Now, Master is safe

893
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,640
â™«You are my distant callâ™«

894
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,900
and he doesn't want to leave Bodhi Village.

895
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,460
I can't force him.

896
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,790
â™«You are my first and lastâ™«

897
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,260
And Chong Zhao

898
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,080
has reunited with his parents.

899
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,060
There's no need for me to stay any longer.

900
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:26,260
â™«My heart is trembling for youâ™«

901
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,650
Let's go.

902
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,600
Let's continue collecting Contemplations

903
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,250
and finding Xi,

904
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,740
okay?

905
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,540
â™«In this moment where we embrace each otherâ™«

906
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,130
No matter what decision you make,

907
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,250
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

908
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,500
I'll be with you.

909
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,020
There are only two bedrooms at home.

910
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,270
My parents are in one room.

911
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,520
Only this one is left.

912
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,060
You sleep on the bed.

913
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,390
I'll sleep on the floor.

914
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,330
Chong Zhao,

915
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,230
let's stay in Bodhi Village, okay?

916
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,210
You've been separated from your parents for so many years.

917
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,360
Let's stay here

918
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,620
to keep them company,

919
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,770
okay?

920
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,280
That was just a random comment.

921
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,680
Don't take it to heart.

922
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,410
Tomorrow.

923
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,850
I'll leave tomorrow.

924
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,220
That's not what I meant.

925
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,040
I just feel something is wrong.

926
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,460
What do you mean?

927
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,080
My parents have always hated evil

928
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,720
and viewed protecting humans as their duty.

929
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,960
They'd slain countless demons

930
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,620
under their sword,

931
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,830
but now they're comfortable living here.

932
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,970
They don't care about the fight between immortals and demons anymore.

933
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,370
Can 10 years in seclusion

934
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,630
really change someone's

935
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,330
century-old beliefs?

936
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,330
Maybe it's because they'd had a

937
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,810
life-or-death experience.

938
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,190
I hope so.

939
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,210
But didn't you notice?

940
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,880
Since they met me,

941
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,360
they said a lot and explained a lot,

942
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
but they never asked me...

943
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,700
How I grew up all these years

944
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,940
or how I've been doing.

945
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,280
What a beautiful night.

946
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,210
You should have a good dream.

947
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,240
You're akin to the stars in the world.

948
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,120
My heart

949
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,400
yearns for you.

950
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,610
Good.

951
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,610
Jing Yuan.

952
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,010
Meeting you

953
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,550
and falling in love with you

954
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,980
is the happiest thing

955
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,710
in my long and boring life.
