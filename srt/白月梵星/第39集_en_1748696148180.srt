1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
finally

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,420
Artists

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,040
Be sure to update Your Assault contrater Powers

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,920
Now

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,920
The world is here.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
We are here.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I only want to watch every sunset with my beloved.

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,920
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
You and him are not the same person.

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,920
I'm willing to be like a star, a moon.

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I only want to be with you forever.

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,920
I only want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,920
I only want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
I only want to be with you forever.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,920
I only want to be with you forever.

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
I only want to be with you forever.

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
We are here together.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I only want to be with you forever.

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I only want to be with you forever.

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,920
I only want to be with you forever.

22
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
I only want to be with you forever.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,920
I only want to be with you forever.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,920
The story begins.

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,920
The former Fuling Demon Army went through a lot of trials and tribulations.

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Now, they have no use for us.

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
What a pity.

28
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
I should give you a chance.

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
What do you want to do?

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I said that I would be in the world.

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
The Fuling Demon Army is not a good choice.

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,920
But it's not bad to have a lot of success.

33
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,920
As long as you follow me and help me to make the Fuling Demon Army,

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,920
you will be able to enter the Cold Spring Palace.

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,920
You used to do such things.

36
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Right?

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Don't think about it.

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
What if Chongzhao's life is in front of you?

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I will see how you will choose.

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Chongzhao!

41
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Xi!

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Xi!

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Chongzhao!

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
You are still here.

45
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
You are really here.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
We still have a lot of things to do.

47
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I know you are waiting for me.

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
I won't let you down easily.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
It's really touching.

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Actually, your existence is not unacceptable to me.

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Chongzhao,

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
try to persuade him.

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Instead of fighting,

54
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
you should just follow me.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
This is the choice of a smart person.

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Xi,

57
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,920
you have been in the Fuling Demon Army for ten years.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
You should have left the Cold Spring Palace and returned to the White West.

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't go back to the old ways.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
The justice of the world,

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
your future is more important than my life.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't be threatened by him.

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I don't listen to you.

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Chongzhao!

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Chongzhao!

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Xi,

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
remember, no matter what you do to me,

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
even if you kill me,

69
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
you can't marry me.

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
You...

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
You can't get over it.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I really don't understand

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
why you like such a person who has no need to be stubborn.

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Xi,

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
you don't understand what he means.

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Your so-called justice

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,920
is the most ridiculous thing in my eyes.

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
I give you a chance

79
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
not to represent me,

80
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
but you.

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
If you don't cherish it,

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
then you should look at it from the side.

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
See how the Immortal Demon

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
is going to be a burden to me.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Xi,

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Xi said that

87
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,920
he could feel that the new moon God is on the east road.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
But no matter how I call him,

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
there is no God.

90
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
The Five-Nin Sword and the King of the Yi Sword

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
also have no reaction to him.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
The Five-Nin Sword and the King of the Yi Sword

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,920
were the reason they felt that you have the power of the new moon.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
But the new moon palace has no reaction.

95
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Unless...

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Unless he hasn't awakened yet,

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
he doesn't know that he is the God.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
The new moon God

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
could not only kill the new moon,

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
but also kill the whole world.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
This means that he has his own consciousness

102
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
and is different from the other gods.

103
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Oh no.

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Mo Li attacked every door of the Demon Sect.

105
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
There were so many of them.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
They escaped to the emergency ward.

107
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Mo Li saved the demon.

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
He is ready to attack the emergency ward.

109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
The emergency ward is in a complicated state.

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
It is natural that the demon is forced to stay.

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I believe that the important demon in the new moon palace

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
is not a single fight.

113
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,920
But there are many of the demons you saved.

114
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
If Mo Li attacks,

115
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
they will not be able to resist.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I have told the people in the emergency ward

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
that no one can stop the emergency ward.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
What do you want?

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
The new moon God has given me all the powers.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I can remember the entire emergency ward

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
by using my power to control the whole night.

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
The demon God's power is strong,

123
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
but the emergency ward has hundreds of thousands of li of emeralds.

124
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
If we use all the powers to control the whole night,

125
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
we will not stop the power.

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
My Lady, you are ruining yourself.

127
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I am the one who is in the emergency ward.

128
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
No matter who is the first,

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I will entrust my life to the power.

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
My Lady.

132
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
You don't stop him.

133
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
If he doesn't do that,

134
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
he is not the new moon,

135
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
which I don't know.

136
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
He has suffered a lot before,

137
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
and suffered a lot.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
So he wants to call for the people in the emergency ward.

139
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
This is his choice.

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I will not stop him.

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
And I have already said

142
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
that I will fight with my enemies

143
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
and die together.

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

146
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

147
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

148
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

149
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

150
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

152
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

153
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

154
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

156
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

157
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

158
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
The power of the power to control the whole night.

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Run!

160
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Don't shoot!

161
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't shoot.

162
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Hurry up!

163
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Don't die!

164
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
If you use the power of the Purple Moon to make a move,

165
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
you will be able to get rid of the evil spirit.

166
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I didn't expect that the Fairy Tribe would be able to escape to the place where they are.

167
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
They will be able to survive through the cover of the Moon.

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Fan Yuan!

169
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I'm fine.

170
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I thought that the Moon Sect Master was in a bad mood.

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Now they will know that you are the one who is the most despicable.

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Do they know that it doesn't matter?

173
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,920
The important thing is, no matter what happens next,

174
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I can't let Mo Li's wildness succeed.

175
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Mo Li destroyed the Divine Jade 60,000 years ago.

176
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,920
After 60,000 years, I won't let her destroy Dong Lu.

177
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I was hoping that this round of Purple Moon

178
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
would give me great hope.

179
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
This time, it will be the same.

180
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,920
The Purple Moon is in danger. It will protect the Fairy Tribe.

181
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Mo Li, you can't win in the end.

182
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You think that if the Purple Moon protects the Divine Jade,

183
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
it will protect those Fairy Cakes forever?

184
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
What I want to do is that no one can stop me.

185
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I and Fan Yue won't be a match.

186
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
They will surely find a way to cure you.

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Is that so?

188
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm afraid that the World's Human Tribe won't be able to wait for the Divine Jade.

189
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
What do you mean?

190
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
The Human Tribe doesn't know the Fairy Cakes and the Divine Jade.

191
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
They don't know how difficult the world will be.

192
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,920
At this moment, they are all staying in the Garden Land to live their peaceful days.

193
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
The Purple Moon protects the Divine Jade and the Fairy Cakes.

194
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
How can it protect the entire Human Tribe?

195
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
You are so kind. You are so kind to the Human Tribe.

196
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
You are considered the God of the Valley. You are so despicable.

197
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
In my eyes, there is only one thing that is not true.

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
There is no one that is not.

199
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Tomorrow, I will show you a good show.

200
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Are you satisfied with this show?

201
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
You are so kind to the Human Tribe.

202
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
You are not supposed to break the barrier of the Purple Moon.

203
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
The Purple Moon is the God of the God.

204
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
The Human Tribe is the Blood of the Sun.

205
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
The Sun is the Sun.

206
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Why not?

207
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
You killed me!

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,920
You are so cruel to kill you.

209
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
The Blood of the Sun is the God of the Sky.

210
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
The God of the Sky?

211
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
If the God of the Sky can really kill me,

212
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
I would have died already 60,000 years ago.

213
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,920
The God of the Sky is the only one who can kill the God of the Sky.

214
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
The God of the Sky must also be respected.

215
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I believe you.

216
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,740
Please do not play with it,

217
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,100
in order to make you happy!

218
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
What a great match!

219
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
You're the best!

220
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
You're the best!

221
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
You're the best!

222
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
You're the best!

223
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
You're the best!

224
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
You're the best!

225
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
You're the best!

226
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Look at this Saint of the Rings.

227
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Blood and Fire.

228
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
It's really a grand achievement!

229
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
You're the best!

230
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
You're the best!

231
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
You're the best!

232
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You'll be a retarded!

233
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
You'll be a retarded!

234
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Stop talking!

235
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I think I've heard

236
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
the sound of blood and fire

237
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
running through the ring.

238
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
You're the best!

239
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
It's really bitter.

240
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Master, the Immortals of the Lai Binan

241
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
have all been settled.

242
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Both sides have put down

243
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
the Western Regions and have a safe journey.

244
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Master, what's wrong?

245
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Are you feeling unwell?

246
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Master!

247
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
What's going on?

248
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
The Immortals of the Lai Binan

249
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
have all been settled.

250
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Both sides have been settled.

251
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Master, you're the best.

252
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
You're the best!

253
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
You're the best!

254
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Master, the Immortals of the Lai Binan

255
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
have a safe journey.

256
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
In the name of the Immortals,

257
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
I must do something.

258
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Master, the Immortals of the Lai Binan

259
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
have a safe journey.

260
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
You will make the way for the Immortals.

261
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Master, take care of your master.

262
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Master!

263
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm sure you'll be able to defeat Ziyue so soon.

264
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
It seems you're not the King of the Garden anymore.

265
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,100
I won't let you win, no matter it's Fan Yue or the King of the Garden.

266
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
The Lan Sha Wugu Clan is so heartless.

267
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Mo Li, you don't deserve to be a god.

268
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
It's not you who should be the one to say that.

269
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
You can't stop me from being a great master.

270
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I can't beat you.

271
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I'm a master.

272
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I'm the one who should be the one to tell you,

273
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I won't let you win, no matter it's Fan Yue or the King of the Garden.

274
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I won't let you win.

275
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:31,860
Watermonial Earth Master

276
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,740
Ap limitations

277
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,700
help our Yunnan

278
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,220
all avoiding them

279
00:17:39,220 --> 00:18:07,720
China 10

280
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,600
The blood is running through the blood of the sea

281
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
The heart is burning

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The blood is burning, the blood is running through the blood of the sea

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The white blood is burning, the blood is flowing

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The white blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

288
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

290
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
The blood is flowing through the blood of the sea

291
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Where is this?

292
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm not old enough.

293
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I'm back safely.

294
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You're safe.

295
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm finally back.

296
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Don't talk.

297
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll help you.

298
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Ah Shuang, don't cry.

299
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
This life is my biggest happiness

300
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
to be with you.

301
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Only in the future,

302
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I'll be able to

303
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
protect you.

304
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't want to.

305
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
We just met.

306
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I've made a promise.

307
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
We'll go through the difficulties together

308
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
and start over.

309
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Don't leave me, okay?

310
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't want to leave our uncle.

311
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I don't want to leave our uncle.

312
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I don't want to leave our uncle.

313
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
But in my life,

314
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I've done too many things.

315
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I've been walking for ten years

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
in the cold palace.

317
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I want to die in a corner.

318
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I want to die in a corner.

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Maybe this way,

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
I can also take the antidote.

321
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Ah Shuang,

322
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
don't be sad.

323
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Remember,

324
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
the starry night

325
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
is the first of the clouds.

326
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm Chen Xi.

327
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
You're Xin Yue.

328
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
The starry night is the first of the clouds.

329
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
You must always

330
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
be with me.

331
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Always

332
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
in that endless white world.

333
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
That year,

334
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
that year,

335
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm not leaving.

336
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm just tired.

337
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I want to go home.

338
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
You see,

339
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm so happy.

340
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I seem

341
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
to see my father.

342
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Father,

343
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
when can we eat?

344
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm starving.

345
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Wait.

346
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Xi Er,

347
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
where have you been?

348
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Don't steal.

349
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Why are you going home now?

350
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Come and eat dumplings.

351
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
That's right, Xi.

352
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
If you don't eat, the dumplings will get cold.

353
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Hurry up.

354
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Come, come.

355
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
If you don't come,

356
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
I won't let you eat.

357
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Why do you always

358
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
do other things?

359
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
You're so jealous.

360
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Don't eat.

361
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Come.

362
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Xi Er,

363
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
why don't you eat?

364
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
You have to eat while it's hot.

365
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
It's hot.

366
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Father.

367
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
What's wrong?

368
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Nothing.

369
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I haven't seen you

370
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
for a long time.

371
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I want to call you.

372
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Father,

373
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I usually do things

374
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
that I don't like to do.

375
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Don't blame me.

376
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
I don't blame you.

377
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
How could I blame you?

378
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
It's all my fault.

379
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm not...

381
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Don't, don't, don't.

382
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
What's wrong, Xi Er?

383
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
You...

384
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
You haven't eaten dumplings.

385
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
You're crying because you saw my dumplings.

386
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
You're crying because of me?

387
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm really...

388
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
I'm really sorry

389
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
about what I did to you.

390
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Since it's about the past,

391
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
let it go.

392
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
I forgot how I told you.

393
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
In our Bai family,

394
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
we don't fight and we don't fight.

395
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
We don't fight and we don't fight.

396
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
We don't fight and we don't fight.

397
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
We don't fight and we don't fight.

398
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
We don't fight and we don't fight.

399
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Don't cry.

400
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Okay, okay.

401
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Father, Xi Er is back.

402
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
He won't leave you anymore.

403
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
He won't leave you anymore.

404
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Okay.

405
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
If you don't leave me,

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
since you've cried,

407
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
forget about the unhappy things.

408
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Try my dumplings.

409
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Do you want to see me?

410
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Come on. I'll add one for you.

411
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Hurry up.

412
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
How is it?

413
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
It's delicious.

414
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Did you hear that?

415
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
It's delicious.

416
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Not bad.

417
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Let's eat more.

418
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I'm hungry.

419
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Shuang,

420
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
if you come,

421
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
we'll be together

422
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
for a long time.

423
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Okay?

424
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,240
What song has never been heard before?

425
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Is it a dream?

426
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,240
You are my dream.

427
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm your flower.

428
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I'm yours.

429
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm yours.

430
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm yours.

431
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
I'm yours.

432
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm yours.

433
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
In this life,

434
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,240
I'm not the same.

435
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160
The flower of m ist.

436
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,380
changed to color

437
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,340

You know

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,720
men

442
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,660

You lose the dragon bitch!

452
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,060
She and her life, then you surrender damn you!

453
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,660
You're one拿 I press such a violent button

454

I'll pay tribute to you

455
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,860
You're wrong

456
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,860
I'm afraid of the wind and the wind

457
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
If you are not strong enough

458
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,860
I will fight with my big dream

459
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,860
I will find the world

460
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,860
I will hide the world

461
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I will go to the lake

462
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,860
I will take the two paths

463
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I will live my life

464
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
I will live my life

465
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
I will go to the lake

466
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
I will go to the lake

467
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,860
I will go to the lake

468
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
I will go to the lake

469
00:28:50,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Why do I feel heartache?

470
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
No

471
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I don't know how to feel heartache

472
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I don't know how to feel heartache

473
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
Chong Chao

474
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
It's you

475
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
It's you, Mo Li

476
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
I will kill you

477
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,860
You?

478
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
You want to hurt me?

479
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Why do you want to kill him?

480
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I left him a life

481
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
He always did what I did

482
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
to find the way to death

483
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
Chong Chao

484
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I left you a life

485
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
for your great grace

486
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
You should stay in this world

487
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
and live a peaceful life

488
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
If you dare to disturb my heart again

489
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
I don't mind destroying your last life

490
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,860
If you dare to destroy it

491
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
why don't you do it now?

492
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
As long as my life is gone

493
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
you will be the same, Chong Chao

494
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
You won't

495
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
I will

496
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
Let go of me

497
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,860
I will die

498
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
I will die

499
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,860
Why are you laughing?

500
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,860
I am laughing at your pity

501
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
You are a god

502
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
but you don't know what love is

503
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
No one loves you

504
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
You are saying you want to marry Xing Yue

505
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,860
because you can't

506
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
You want to use the way to kill me

507
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
But I tell you

508
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
You are wrong

509
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Love in this world will not come from the war

510
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
You are dead

511
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Jing Han is still in front of me

512
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
and is saying love

513
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
You are laughing

514
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Chong Chao

515
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
A Xin

516
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,860
A Xin

517
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
A Xin

518
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
A Xin

519
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
A Xin

520
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
I am sorry

521
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
I didn't protect you well

522
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,860
I am sorry

523
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
I am sorry

524
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Chong Chao

525
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Don't cry

526
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,860
This is all my choice

527
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
God and love

528
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
will always be there

529
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
and not only in the world

530
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,860
I am sorry

531
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
for meeting you

532
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,860
in this world

533
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Chong Chao

534
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
If there is a future

535
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
we will be a normal couple

536
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Okay?

537
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Okay

538
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,860
When my pain and tears are both eyes

539
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,860
I only see you in my heart

540
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,860
When you are always in my heart

541
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,860
I am sorry

542
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
I believe

543
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
that you can take the blame

544
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
when you love me

545
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,860
When my heart is only a part of you

546
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
When I am alone

547
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
I can only be with you

548
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
when you are with me

549
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,860
When my pain and tears are both eyes

550
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
I only see you in my heart

551
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
A Xin

552
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
A Xin

553
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
I believe

554
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
that you can take the blame

555
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
I believe

556
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
You said you wanted to marry Xing Yue

557
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
because you couldn't

558
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
You wanted to fight with the killing

559
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,860
Love in this world

560
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
will never come from the battle

561
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
I don't need such stupid things

562
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
I will prove to you

563
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,860
that without love

564
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Zhao Yang can get everything

565
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Xing Yue

566
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
You will be my

567
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
You will be my

568
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
I finally understand

569
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
why that monster ten years ago

570
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,860
wanted to kill me and A Xi

571
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
A Xi was angry

572
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
and finally understood

573
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
why Jin Yao couldn't kill him

574
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
A Xi was never a normal person

575
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
He is Xing Yue's god

576
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
I should have guessed

577
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
Xing Yue's god

578
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,860
was born by Xing Yue's god

579
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Fan Yuan

580
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
You said that there is no love

581
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
He asked A Xi to appear in this world

582
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
Is he going to let him sacrifice forever for me?

583
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
This life

584
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
You are telling the truth, he is a play

585
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
You have already surpassed the relationship between master and god

586
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
but he is the closest family in this world

587
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
He saved you

588
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
not because of the mission of the god

589
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
but because of the protection of sister

590
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
A Xi's biggest wish

591
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
is to hope that you can do well

592
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
For him

593
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
you have to do it

594
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
A Xi's death

595
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
changed my life

596
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
I will do as he wishes

597
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
I will do everything

598
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
I will do everything

599
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
I will do everything

600
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
for him

601
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
for all the dead

602
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
for him

603
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Fan Yuan

604
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Fan Yuan

605
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Master

606
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
What's going on?

607
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,860
Master used the power of Purple Moon

608
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
to protect the whole jade

609
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
It has been damaged

610
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
and it has been damaged by the blood of thousands of people

611
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
How will the Eighth Soul-Slayer

612
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
The Purple Moon has been cured

613
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
and the Moon has been cured

614
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
The Moon has been integrated into the power of Purple Moon

615
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
to make the power of the Moon and the Moon

616
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
to be in the body of the master

617
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Even if the master is a god

618
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
he can't bear the power of these two bodies

619
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
If it goes on like this

620
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
the Eighth Soul-Slayer

621
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
will be in the body

622
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Master

623
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
I will use the divine mirror

624
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
to train the evil spirit and the evil spirit

625
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
to practice the evil power

626
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
The power of the evil spirit is more powerful

627
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
Don't fight

628
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
The evil spirit

629
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
can't fight with the power of the master

630
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
Master

631
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
Master

632
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
Don't think that you are strong

633
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
We will be defeated

634
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Master, is it not important

635
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
if you are defeated by me?

636
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
You can kill me anyway

637
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
You want to gather all the evil spirit here

638
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
What are you doing?

639
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
I just want to play a game with you

640
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
Bai Shu

641
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,860
You are all familiar with it

642
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Now your lives

643
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
are in Bai Shu's hands

644
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Life or death

645
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
are all in his mind

646
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
Master

647
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Master

648
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,660
Bing

649
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,700
The evil spirit is waiting for the power of the VO

650
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
What's wrong?

651
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Nothing.

652
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Tian Huo, it's time.

653
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
No matter what happens, don't hide it.

654
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
It's the demon's message.

655
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Molly controlled the world's evil spirit and released it.

656
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
She wants you to go to the Cold Palace alone.

657
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Otherwise, she will kill all the evil spirits one day.

658
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Why are you afraid so duly?

659
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,200
Until now, your everything

660
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,700
has been around me.

661
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
This time...

662
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
I have to go face it.

663
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,200
Remember what I once said?

664
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
It seems very light.

665
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I can only regard it as a story.

666
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
It seems very heavy.

667
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
It's the fate that has been in the hands of the whole world.

668
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm a human being.

669
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I never thought of becoming an old god.

670
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
But now I'm at the end of the world.

671
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,200
I can't hide from the danger of not being safe.

672
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I can't hide.

673
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I can't hide.

674
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I wish...

675
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
...to forgive my own self.

676
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
You really think it through?

677
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Now that the world is at risk,

678
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Fan Yue is almost trying to protect herself.

679
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I won't take a step back.

680
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I don't know if Fan Yue will wake up.

681
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
When will she wake up?

682
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
But if she wakes up,

683
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
you can't let her go to the Cold Spring Palace.

684
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
You want to save the fairy demon,

685
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
but you never thought of yourself.

686
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Mo Li let you go alone.

687
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
He is really against you.

688
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,200
My father was forced to die in Ning'an City.

689
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
When I left, I was full of hatred for this world.

690
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I don't believe in the fairy, the demon, the human,

691
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
or even the god.

692
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,200
When I left, I found that there are people who are kind.

693
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,200
There are people who are bound by the Taoism and the truth.

694
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
They shouldn't have been destroyed like this.

695
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
This world shouldn't have been like this.

696
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
But the Yi-Demons have broken up.

697
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Even if you have the power to protect the world,

698
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
you can't use it.

699
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
With your spirit, you can die.

700
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
The world is not just about the holy power.

701
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,200
You should do everything you can to protect the world.

702
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
We don't have any grudge or victory.

703
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,200
But we still have to fight for the people we want to protect.

704
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Isn't that right?

705
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Everyone has his own responsibility.

706
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
The fairy demon is kind and has a good character.

707
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
But the god is not.

708
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Maybe it's because of this moment.

709
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Bai Shuang.

710
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Tian Huo,

711
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,200
for Fan Yue and for the Hall of Moon,

712
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
you've never been so selfish.

713
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
You must be very clear about this feeling.

714
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
You must understand it, too.

715
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Right?

716
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Don't worry.

717
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I'm just a person who's dead.

718
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm always lucky.

719
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
I won't die so easily.

720
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Tian Huo.

721
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I'm lucky to be with you.

722
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Thank you for your journey.

723
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
If I can come back,

724
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
let's drink together.

725
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
No.

726
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
It's me.

727
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
It's really me.

728
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
It's really me.

729
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
He's really back.

730
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
It's you.

731
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
You're really here.

732
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
What?

733
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Fan Yue didn't stop you?

734
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
Or did he say he didn't stop you at all?

735
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Let them go.

736
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
The two of them never treat you well.

737
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
It's not like they're fighting for the throne.

738
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
They're just going to kill you.

739
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
You still want to save them?

740
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Don't say those nonsense.

741
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
You proposed to me.

742
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I made a promise.

743
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I did what I should do.

744
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
You should also promise.

745
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Fine.

746
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
As long as you promise me one thing,

747
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'll spare them all.

748

Mo Li is very familiar with it.
