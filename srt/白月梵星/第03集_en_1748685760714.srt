1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,820
Let's go!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mr. Naive.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No one will have the gifts you want久暗、

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you & him.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go to listen to all� a without fire.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Evening,

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mo Qiong,

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Zhou Sans wai,

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No one will have the gifts you want.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,820
I'm ready.

17
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,580
We both died alike.

18
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,440
Life and death are und Vlad.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Can Cloud Red please inform me

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,520
to the click in the니-1

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,120
for myRudy

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,520
or whiI do not want to stop

23
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:45,120
the Chant of the

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Peng Yandong

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,680
that was 6 hours ago,

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,400
don't tell me you

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,720
a newOTH

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
Now by example

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,380
It's the badending of fire reactive blows.

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,920
구나

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,840
nimo

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,480
Bun

33
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,080
gs

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,180
A服

35
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,300
I wear a uniform and wash out an imp 😳

36
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,780
Oh, Xi Xi saw it.

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,940
Lan Lin's immortal army is so good.

38
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,260
She can't get out of here.

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,020
Master, the Hall of Moon Palace is in Ning'an.

40
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,980
But the people's tribe has no time to be free.

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,260
If they don't collude,

42
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,980
it's only that the Hall of Moon Palace

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,300
can't get rid of her.

44
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,500
Bring that people back.

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
Yes, Master.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
There's one more thing.

47
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,820
I've already sent the poison to Ning'an last night.

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,260
But it seems like

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,300
I didn't think of it.

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,860
The attack of the Demon Lord Fulin

51
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,620
is too strong.

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,540
Master, the tribe is missing.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,820
The leader is here.

54
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,940
Could you please talk to him?

55
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,060
Please take care of him.

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
Okay.

57
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,580
Chen Yi, you did a good job.

58
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,300
You can't get out of the Cold Palace,

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,980
but you're better than a thousand miles away.

60
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,540
You're amazing.

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,180
The poison has been missing for a long time.

62
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,860
I've been in the dark for many years,

63
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,420
so I asked her to come back to the room.

64
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,860
How is her effect?

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,380
If you want to ask,

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
why don't you directly ask me?

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,380
Then I want to ask you, Chen Ye Yao.

68
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,060
Last night, the poison was already gone.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Why is there no movement at the moment?

70
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,380
Could it be that

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,780
the previous attack of the Demon Lord Fulin

72
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,220
failed your research of the Demon Lord Fulin?

73
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,300
The Demon Lord Fulin is here.

74
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,580
What's the effect?

75
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,580
The poison is gone.

76
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,020
The poison is gone.

77
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,220
Once it's gone, it's gone.

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,980
He needs to thank the Demon Lord Fulin

79
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,580
for helping him get out of the room.

80
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,900
The position is not good.

81
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,980
Why is there no movement at the moment?

82
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,220
It's because I've controlled the medicine.

83
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,620
When there's no one at night,

84
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,180
the person is asleep.

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,300
The whole tribe is dead.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
Isn't that even more interesting?

87
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,180
Master.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,860
What's that?

89
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,580
It's so funny.

90
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,180
Interesting.

91
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,740
I think you're too bored to be in the palace.

92
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,380
It's not like the Demon Lord Fulin

93
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,980
who has been in the Four Seas for so long

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,700
but has never been able to get the fate of Fan Yu for the ten sons.

95
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,260
You...

96
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,020
Enough.

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,260
You two

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
are both in the Cold Palace.

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,060
You grew up together.

100
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,460
You're making a fuss.

101
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,060
Don't delay the official affairs.

102
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,340
Yes, Master.

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,380
Fulin will bring back the White Beast.

104
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll remember your revenge.

105
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
The poison is gone.

106
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,900
Fan Yu will be in the whole tribe

107
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,820
to get out of the room.

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,340
Okay.

109
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,780
He's gone.

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,100
Master.

111
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
What's the matter?

112
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,900
There was another demon in the city last night.

113
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,580
It's cold in the cold.

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,660
I can't hold it anymore.

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,660
I just don't know if they're using the Five Seasons

116
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,300
or the Hallows.

117
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,460
It's okay to use anything.

118
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,500
They've been killing the demon five years ago.

119
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,380
If he still dares to do it,

120
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,820
he'll kill him.

121
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,220
I'll buy all the food I like.

122
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,780
He'll be happy the day after tomorrow.

123
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,340
Zhao.

124
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,260
Zhao.

125
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,100
What's wrong?

126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,580
What's wrong with you?

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,420
You're not in the mood today.

128
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,500
You were too tired last night.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,340
I just didn't think it through.

130
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,580
I can't sleep.

131
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,660
What's the matter?

132
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,500
Tell me. I'll help you.

133
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,740
It's nothing. It's business.

134
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,220
Don't be so stubborn.

135
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,700
Business is important,

136
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,380
but it's more important.

137
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,820
The same goes for the old man.

138
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,060
He's always busy with work.

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,700
He doesn't sleep at all.

140
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,820
He's always tired of his own problems.

141
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,780
Zhao,

142
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,620
try to persuade him

143
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,420
to sleep at night and eat at night.

144
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,220
You've always been concerned about Uncle Bai.

145
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,140
Why didn't you tell him about it?

146
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,340
I didn't tell him about it.

147
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
He'd be upset if he didn't say it.

148
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,460
He'd listen to you more than I did.

149
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
If I'm not around,

150
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,860
you can take care of him.

151
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,140
If you're not around, you have to marry him.

152
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,340
Okay.

153
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,860
Help me!

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,900
Help me!

155
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,780
Help me!

156
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,820
He's a fine surgeon.

157
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,900
He stuck his teeth in the girlfriend's.

158
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,340
Why is that?

159
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,020
Take him away!

160
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Go!

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
Bai Yu!

162
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
What's going on?

163
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,860
Second Miss, Mr. Chong Zhou.

164
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,980
Last night, I didn't know why he suddenly sent this crazy man.

165
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,780
There were seven or eight people, but he was still the same.

166
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,660
He didn't have any spirit.

167
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,540
There were people everywhere.

168
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
It was dangerous.

169
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,620
What about my father?

170
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,220
The Chief was asked by the doctor this morning.

171
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,740
He's now giving the others treatment.

172
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,860
I'm not going to talk anymore. I'm going to the patrol.

173
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Uncle, I have something to do. I have to go out.

174
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
You go back first.

175
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
He suddenly left the city.

176
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
I'll be back soon.

177
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,900
It's not safe outside. Be careful.

178
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Chen Dan.

179
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Chief.

180
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Did you find a way to cure him?

181
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
I've been in the police for a long time.

182
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I've never seen this disease.

183
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
I really don't know what to do.

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I can't help it.

185
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
This disease must be cured.

186
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
This city must not fall.

187
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Yes.

188
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I'll try my best.

189
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
I'll try my best.

190
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Brother.

191
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I'll go in.

192
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Brother Cheng Zhao.

193
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Brother Cheng Zhao.

194
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Sister Le Zhu.

195
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Today is not a pre-wedding ceremony.

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Why did you come back suddenly?

197
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I have something to ask Master and Uncle.

198
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
You'd better not go now.

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
What's wrong?

200
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
I don't know what's wrong with you.

201
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Something happened in Laning.

202
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
What happened?

203
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
There was a pre-wedding message last night.

204
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
A few dead Laning disciples

205
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
were found in the human clan.

206
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
The investigation is done by the demon clan.

207
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Which demon clan?

208
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I don't know yet.

209
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
The chief and Feng Yu

210
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
were both on fire.

211
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
They were already investigated.

212
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Yu Feng and the two of them were very shocked.

213
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
They are still angry.

214
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
If you are not in a hurry,

215
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
you'd better report it later.

216
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
That's right.

217
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Yu Feng, please help me remember.

218
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
I'll go to the chief tomorrow.

219
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
I'll go to the chief.

220
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
I'll definitely...

221
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Uncle.

222
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Why did you come back?

223
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
Did something happen in Niancheng?

224
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
There were indeed some demons in Niancheng.

225
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
They caused some trouble.

226
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
I wanted to ask how Master should be treated.

227
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Demon?

228
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Demon is a bad thing.

229
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
He killed my disciples.

230
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Chongzhao, no matter how big or small the demon is,

231
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
it's not a big deal.

232
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Uncle,

233
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Chongzhao has something to ask you.

234
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
What is it?

235
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
When Liu Luo was out for five years,

236
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
he was taken by the chief.

237
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
How should we treat it?

238
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,300
A piece of it was taken by the chief of the ancient ancient city.

239
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Who is he?

240
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Don't you think there is a chief in this world?

241
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
If it's the chief,

242
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
it's simple.

243
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
If the ancestors were to enter the sect,

244
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
if it's the demons,

245
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
they would be killed.

246
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
What if it's the human clan?

247
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
The human clan has the power.

248
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Is it just that...

249
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
The human heart is in a state of shock.

250
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
The human clan who has no idea about it should be killed.

251
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Stop!

252
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
If you continue to do it,

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
I'm really useless.

254
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
How much do you have to do this month?

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Give it to me.

256
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Don't pull me.

257
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Don't pull me.

258
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Let me break your legs.

259
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
What am I doing?

260
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Why hasn't the chief come back yet?

261
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Is something wrong?

262
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Who are you?

263
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You're a human clan.

264
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
You're so annoying.

265
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
You're really unintelligent.

266
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Human clan?

267
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
You're not human?

268
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Since you know I'm not human,

269
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
I suggest you stop your old ways and go back with me.

270
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Where are you going?

271
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
You have too many questions.

272
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
The firefly?

273
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
The cold spring palace's spirit.

274
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Who is he?

275
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
A person who has no idea.

276
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Like you?

277
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Who are you?

278
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm the one who has no idea.

279
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
You're the one who has no idea.

280
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
The one who has no idea?

281
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Who are you?

282
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Who are you?

283
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
What are you doing?

284
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I'm leaving.

285
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
My father's birthday is not here yet.

286
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
If you don't leave,

287
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
your father's birthday is not here yet.

288
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Your death will be here.

289
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
What do you mean?

290
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Make it clear.

291
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Otherwise, I won't leave with you.

292
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
This is...

293
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
The spirit's demon.

294
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
The spirit's demon.

295
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Shoujun!

296
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Shoujun, what's wrong with you?

297
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Shoujun!

298
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Shoujun, you can't die.

299
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
What if you die?

300
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
What if Xixi takes you back?

301
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
What...

302
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
What should I do?

303
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
The thing that happened in Ashou's body

304
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
can't be revealed.

305
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
What should I do?

306
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
What should I do?

307
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
The thing that happened in Ashou's body

308
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
can't be revealed.

309
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Before Xixi finds out,

310
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
she has to find a way to get out of here.

311
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
No!

312
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
The fairy is coming!

313
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
It's too late.

314
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
I can only take the demon from Shoujun first.

315
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Miss, what's wrong?

316
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Why are you so badly injured?

317
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
I'll take you to the clinic first.

318
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Excuse me.

319
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Doctor!

320
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Doctor!

321
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
She's seriously injured.

322
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Please save her.

323
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
What?

324
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
She's seriously injured.

325
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
She's not in a good condition.

326
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
That's good.

327
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
The doctor.

328
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
How is she?

329
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
She's seriously injured.

330
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
She's not in a good condition.

331
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
That's good.

332
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll leave the clinic.

333
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
I have something to do.

334
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I'll leave now.

335
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
What else can you do

336
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
to make your wife more important?

337
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
She's already become like this.

338
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Where else are you going?

339
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
She's not my wife.

340
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
No matter if she's your wife or not,

341
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
she's still in the clothes.

342
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I have to treat her with her own care.

343
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
If you leave her alone,

344
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
she'll be a white-and-white figure.

345
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
How can I explain it clearly?

346
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Hurry up and pack your medicine.

347
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
If you don't need it,

348
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
she'll die of blood.

349
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Hurry up.

350
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Hurry up.

351
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
The problem in the city hasn't been solved.

352
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I'm afraid it can't be solved too soon.

353
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Why am I here?

354
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
The power of the power of the five-spice power

355
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
made you see something that a common person shouldn't see.

356
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Tell me.

357
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
What did you see?

358
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
It's the harem of our Bai family.

359
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Why are there so many people in the harem?

360
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
I can't remember.

361
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
There are many pictures and many people.

362
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
What's the point of the five-spice power

363
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
that makes me see these things?

364
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
I've told you before.

365
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,300
The five-spice power needs to be re-enact.

366
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Even if the five-spice power is re-enact,

367
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
what you see will be the key to the memory.

368
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
I'm just looking at you here.

369
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
Hurry up and tell me.

370
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
I can't think of anything in this moment.

371
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Why don't you tell me first

372
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
if the five-spice power is the illusion

373
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
that I saw, or the reality?

374
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
To be honest,

375
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
it's not good for you to be here.

376
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
You misunderstood.

377
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm not a five-spice power in the world of five-spice power.

378
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm just a mortal.

379
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
How can I know the effect of the five-spice power?

380
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
The five-spice power is shown.

381
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
It's not yet been revealed,

382
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
but it will happen in the future.

383
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
If you want to get the idea,

384
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
you need to ensure that it's a secret.

385
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Anyway, you only need to go back to the harem.

386
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Leave the rest to me.

387
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
It's not yet been revealed,

388
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
but it will happen in the future.

389
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Will everything I see happen?

390
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm not sure that this person will help me.

391
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
I need to find out first.

392
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I feel so hurt.

393
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
The more you ask, the more I feel hurt.

394
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
You still want me to go home?

395
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Bai Shu,

396
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
you're lying to me.

397
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
But it's not a good idea.

398
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Don't worry.

399
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I still have something important to do.

400
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I can do it.

401
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
If I remember something,

402
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
I will tell you.

403
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Hurry up!

404
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
The tent is all empty.

405
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Come on.

406
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Go!

407
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Go!

408
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Go!

409
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
My lord,

410
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I saw Bai Shu's body after I followed him.

411
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
He went to a deserted garden.

412
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
He looked like he was poisoned.

413
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
The Cold-Wedged Forest came to catch Bai Shu.

414
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
They must have poisoned him.

415
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Should we take Bai Shu away now?

416
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
No need.

417
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
When Wu Nian gave Bai Shu the chance,

418
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
it was related to the person who was poisoned.

419
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
So, no matter what the first year is,

420
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
it will definitely happen in Ning'an.

421
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
What we have to do is wait.

422
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,300
The Cold-Wedged Forest came to catch Bai Shu.

423
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
It's him.

424
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Miss, you're finally awake.

425
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Where's he?

426
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
He?

427
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,300
You mean the wolf king who sent you here yesterday?

428
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
He said he has something important to do.

429
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
He's gone.

430
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
The tent is already full.

431
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Miss, don't worry.

432
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Miss, you're very wounded.

433
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
You need to recuperate.

434
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
So, you gave me the medicine?

435
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Yes.

436
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Miss, don't worry.

437
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
When I gave you the medicine yesterday,

438
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
the wolf king was also next to you.

439
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Even if someone asks,

440
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
you won't have the reputation of loving you.

441
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Miss, remember to take the medicine.

442
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Have a good rest.

443
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
If you don't love the reputation, you'll die the most quickly.

444
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I've seen the book today.

445
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
It's written in the Five-Times of the Illusion.

446
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
It's indeed a preface.

447
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
It's not a pity to eat the moon.

448
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
From the preface, there's no one who can be normal.

449
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
The words of the Savior are not true or false.

450
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
It's not his fault that the man in the blue-grey eye is now in the frame.

451
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
If it's a mess in the city,

452
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
my father and I will have to risk our lives.

453
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Isn't that a waste of time?

454
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
No.

455
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
I don't want to be a burden to you.

456
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
No.

457
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
I have to find a way to take my father and Zhao away.

458
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
If I keep staying, I'll have to finish them all.

459
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Hurry up!

460
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Let's go to the forest!

461
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Hurry up!

462
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Are you ready?

463
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Yes!

464
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Father!

465
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Bai Yu, you go to the city gate.

466
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
You go to the city gate.

467
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Yes!

468
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Father, listen to me.

469
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Shuang, listen to me first.

470
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Among the security guards,

471
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I have been in charge of the housework these years.

472
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
And some of the dowry your mother left for you.

473
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,300
I will find a way to get Zhao out of the city tonight.

474
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Father, what are you saying?

475
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
You...

476
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
City Leader!

477
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
City Leader!

478
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
There's a new one.

479
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
They can't hold on anymore.

480
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
I know.

481
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Wait for me outside.

482
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Yes!

483
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Shuang, remember to leave as soon as possible.

484
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
There's a big mess in the city.

485
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
It's dangerous to stay here.

486
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Father!

487
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Father!

488
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Father!

489
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
Father!

490
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Father!

491
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Father!

492
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Father!

493
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Father!

494
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Father!

495
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,300
The poison in the city is definitely not good for the body.

496
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
We must find out.

497
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
My stuff is good.

498
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
You all stay on the street.

499
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Go home.

500
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
What's wrong?

501
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
Cheng Nan and Cheng Xi are in trouble.

502
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Do you know the current situation?

503
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Cheng Nan and Cheng Xi are all open.

504
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
They can't control it.

505
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Who knows if these people will run towards us?

506
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
What's wrong?

507
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Go back here.

508
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Go!

509
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Shao Jin, is Xi Xi really good?

510
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
She even can change the army.

511
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Xi Xi didn't run away last night.

512
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
She went back to the palace to give birth to Shao Jin.

513
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Shao Jin, eat.

514
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
You'll be fine after eating.

515
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Why didn't you say anything?

516
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Don't you want to praise me?

517
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Shi Zun often said that the ancestors couldn't bear the big deal.

518
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
But I finally understand today.

519
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Chong Zhao is a leader of the Blue Forest.

520
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
He doesn't know how to avoid harm.

521
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
He saved me with all his heart and effort.

522
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
He's a good person.

523
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
What a fool.

524
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Shao Jin,

525
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,300
how do I feel that you're praising him?

526
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Praise?

527
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Why do you look at me like that?

528
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
I'm not in the right position.

529
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I have something to do.

530
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Please understand.

531
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
How many times do I have to say it?

532
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
All of it.

533
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Then you have to save your energy.

534
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Brother, be careful.

535
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Don't kill anyone.

536
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Yes.

537
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Brothers, be careful.

538
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Don't kill anyone.

539
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
Yes.

540
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Yes.

541
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Tian Yi,

542
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
don't kill him.

543
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
I'll kill him.

544
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Yes.

545
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
You're the most important one here.

546
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Yes.

547
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
I will.

548
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
I'll kill him.

549
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Yes.

550
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Tian Yi,

551
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
don't kill him.

552
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Yes.

553
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Yes.

554
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I will.

555
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Yes.

556
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I will.

557
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Yes.

558
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
No.

559
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
I'll kill him.

560
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Yes.

561
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
You can kill him.

562
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Yes.

563
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Yes.

564
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Yes.

565
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Yes.

566
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,480
Banzan Locker

567
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,700
Don't care you move

568
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Time to monk

569
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,080
It is You

570
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,200
Thank you slice

571
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,760
Save the restless

572
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,620
I knew such long-time

573
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,620
Awww

574
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,700
Goose

575
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,860
So is you

576
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,340
What you are doing is not medicine.

577
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,740
What poison have you put in Ni'an City?

578
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,180
You don't remember the grace,

579
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
but I do remember the love.

580
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,740
This is the new reality of my drug-spending poison.

581
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,020
Lord Lan Ling,

582
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,580
are you satisfied with this?

583
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Father!

584
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Father!

585
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Father!

586
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,620
It seems that Mengmeng is taking me back!

587
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Hurry and go over there! What are you waiting for?

588
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,620
He is your master.

589
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
He became like this to save you.

590
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
You... You are afraid of him.

591
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,100
I tell you,

592
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
my father will not become like that.

593
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Father!

594
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Father!

595
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
Father!

596
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Father!

597
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Father!

598
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Xiao Chu, save me!

599
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,620
You were not like this when you saved me last night.

600
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Father!

601
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Don't go over there, Miss!

602
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
You are being bitten by the ball!

603
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,620
Father, wake up!

604
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
I am Uncle!

605
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Father!

606
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Father!

607
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Father!

608
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Father!

609
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
I am...

610
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,400
Father!

611
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I am your daughter!

612
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,500
How dare you to say that?

613
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Row away, everyone else!

614
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,360
The deceased will be punished if they do this to themselves.

615
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,160
However, this fellow can't harm one another

616
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
It's not worth protecting such a person

617
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,160
if you meet disaster and only care about yourself.

618
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Nonsense!

619
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Although the human race is weak,

620
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
it's pure and kind.

621
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
If you don't teach the people the right thing to do,

622
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
what will the people do?

623
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Pure and kind.

624
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Now Ning'an is in the line,

625
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Bai Xuan is also a famous poison.

626
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I want to see

627
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
what's in this world

628
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,160
and what's pure and kind.

629
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Stop talking nonsense.

630
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Give me the antidote.

631
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
There's no antidote.

632
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Unless you kill all the people who are crazy,

633
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
or else,

634
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
if you don't die,

635
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
it's not worth it.

636
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Fine.

637
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
If you don't give it to me,

638
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
I'll take your life

639
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
and give you the antidote.

640
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
You're really overestimating me.

641
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
The Hall Leader of the Moon has made a decision.

642
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
How can you care about my life?

643
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Hall Leader of the Moon?

644
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,160
You're not even our Hall Leader.

645
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Little Fire Immortal,

646
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
I'm leaving Ning'an early.

647
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
What does she have to do with that flower ghost?

648
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Hall Leader of the Moon,

649
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
don't go into the building.

650
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
There are so many gold trunks in the room.

651
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
How can we find them

652
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
when we need them?

653
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Look, it's my dad.

654
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
You've been reading this for days.

655
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
It's a gift from the Hall Leader.

656
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
If it wasn't for the Hall Leader,

657
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
I'm afraid I wouldn't recognize myself.

658
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
It's my first time learning it.

659
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
It hurts to touch it.

660
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
This must be the most delicious one.

661
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
It's his birthday tomorrow.

662
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Do you think he'll like this?

663
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
I'm sure he'll like

664
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
the gift you gave him.

665
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Bai Shu.

666
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Dad.

667
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Look.

668
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
What are you looking at?

669
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
I warned you.

670
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I told you to go out of the city.

671
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Why didn't you go?

672
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
I was saved by the immortal.

673
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Why couldn't you go?

674
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
There's no immortal.

675
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
I told you.

676
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
You're the Hall Leader's daughter.

677
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
You're a bit of a village.

678
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
If Xi were here,

679
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
he wouldn't want you to be so upset.

680
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Do you think

681
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
if I was the one who took the person

682
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
and didn't take Xi away?

683
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
You're so stupid.

684
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Bai Xuan, I hate you.

685
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Uncle. Uncle.

686
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Uncle. Uncle.

687
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Since you're so young,

688
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
why didn't you tell me?

689
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Miss Hua, stop looking.

690
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Jin Chong is useless to the imperial court.

691
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Old man.

692
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Hold on.

693
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Wait for me.

694
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Bai Yu.

695
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Take care of my dad.

696
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
I'll find a way to cure him.

697
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Miss Hua.

698
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
It's dangerous out there.

699
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
The Immortal Army is here.

700
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
What?

701
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Why are you here?

702
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Immortal Demon, Iron Law,

703
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
and the Demon Clan are in the world.

704
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
How could you fight with Immortal Clan?

705
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Why did you come here?

706
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
What's the point of you

707
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
being so generous?

708
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Tell him.

709
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Three days ago,

710
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
you sent the flower spirit in the building

711
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
to kill the demon.

712
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Today, you sent the people

713
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
to control the people.

714
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
What do you want?

715
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I want to kill the demon.

716
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I want to kill the demon.

717
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I want to kill the demon.

718
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
What?

719
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
The Hall of Moon?

720
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
You can't even see

721
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
the obvious result of the disaster.

722
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
It's really dangerous.

723
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
The Immortal Army is here.

724
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
The Demon Flower Spirit is here.

725
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
The Immortal Fire is here.

726
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
I'll learn more

727
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
if I can kill the demon.

728
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
You said you'd be killed.

729
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Why should I believe you?

730
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I need you first.

731
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
The people in the city are in trouble.

732
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I don't have time

733
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
to trust you.

734
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
The poison is the poison of the demon.

735
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Give me the antidote.

736
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
So you still think about the people

737
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
in your heart.

738
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Tell me.

739
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
The knife is sharp.

740
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
The knife is sharp.

741
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
The knife is sharp.

742
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Remember this.

743
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Never

744
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
think of your people.

745
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
If you really trust the people

746
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
you should have sent the people

747
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
to the south.

748
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
But why don't you

749
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
see the soldiers in the south

750
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
at this moment?

751
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
The poison is the poison of the demon.

752
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
You don't want to report to the Lanling.

753
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Why?

754
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Let me guess.

755
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Because

756
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
you're afraid.

757
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
You're afraid that the Lanling Immortal

758
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
will kill him

759
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
in the White Shire.

760
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
They say if there's evil,

761
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
you'll have to use everything

762
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
in the first place.

763
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
For the life.

764
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Little thing.

765
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Help!

766
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Miss Bai, you're right.

767
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
I'm with this immortal.

768
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I'm testing your death.

769
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,160
He said it was true.

770
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
You're the immortal?

771
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
You're the immortal?

772
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Tell me!

773
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Miss Bai,

774
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
the door of the palace

775
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
is open and the guest room is not open.

776
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
If you have any family issues,

777
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
please go back to the room.

778
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Don't be so serious

779
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
about the palace.

780
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Wait!

781
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
I have something to ask you.

782
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Come with me.

783
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Master,

784
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
let them go.

785
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Bai Shuo came here

786
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,160
just to find the poison of the demon.

787
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
The Xuan Clan can't solve it.

788
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
He'll come back to the base eventually.

789
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
As long as he comes to the base,

790
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
there's no need to be so serious.

791
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Shuo, hide here.

792
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
When the demons

793
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
come out of the cave,

794
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
I'll come to you.

795
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Why did you lie to me?

796
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
You know

797
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
I've been the only one

798
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
to be the immortal since I was a child.

799
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Everyone thinks I'm a fool.

800
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
I'm a fool.

801
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
You've been staring at me

802
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
and laughing at me for the past 10 years.

803
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
You're so funny.

804
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
You've been staring at me

805
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
and quarreling with my father.

806
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Why didn't you tell me?

807
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
You're the immortal!

808
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Answer me!

809
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
The immortal is on the top.

810
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Shuo,

811
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I can't tell you.

812
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
The immortal.

813
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Your immortal

814
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
can compare you and me.

815
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
You and my father have been friends for 10 years.

816
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
You can watch me

817
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
like a fool

818
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
every day.

819
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
You can watch me

820
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
chasing the demons

821
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
when they're the immortal.

822
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
What are you thinking about?

823
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Do you think I'm funny?

824
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
I've never thought about it.

825
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
After my parents died,

826
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I really took you and Uncle Bai

827
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
as my family.

828
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I've never

829
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
trusted them.

830
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Family?

831
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Before,

832
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
you and Fan Yue

833
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
were very close.

834
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
I have doubts.

835
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
But I don't want to doubt it.

836
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Because you're Chongzhao.

837
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
You're my family.

838
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
You've always known

839
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I hate people who lie to me the most.

840
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
But the one who

841
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
lies to me the longest

842
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
is you.

843
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Shuang,

844
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I'm not

845
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
lying to you.

846
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Fine.

847
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
I'll take it as

848
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
your first wish.

849
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
I can't say it.

850
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Since you're the immortal,

851
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
you must have a way

852
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
to call me Old Tongzi, right?

853
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
You're not that old.

854
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
You may not be as young as you are.

855
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
But you must have a master.

856
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
You must have a sect.

857
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
You go and find them.

858
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
They're very powerful.

859
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
You must have a way, right?

860
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Shuang,

861
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
that's the first sect of the Yau Clan.

862
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
The first sect is not going to end.

863
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Even if my master gets married,

864
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
there's no way.

865
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
We've been together for ten years.

866
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
My father treated you like this.

867
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
But there's only one way.

868
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
To save the world first.

869
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
What sect is that?

870
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Dad,

871
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
since you can't save the world first,

872
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,160
I'll go and find the one who can.

873
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Shuang,

874
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Fan Yu is a demon.

875
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
He won't save you.

876
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
He's approaching you.

877
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
No matter what he's approaching me for,

878
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
no matter what he's doing,

879
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I don't care.

880
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
As long as he can save my father,

881
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I'll trust him.

882
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Cheng.

883
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
I swear to you,

884
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
if you go back to the city,

885
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
the first demon won't let you go.

886
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
You stay here first.

887
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
When the Yau Clan is out of the city,

888
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I'll send you to a place

889
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
where you can't find a first demon.

890
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
My father is still waiting for me in the city.

891
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Where are you going to let me escape?

892
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
I won't let Uncle Bai go.

893
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Then tell me how you're going to deal with it.

894
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
You said you can't save the first sect.

895
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Then let me ask you,

896
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
even if the Yau Clan is driven away,

897
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
how do you deal with my father

898
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
and some of the crazy people in the city?

899
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Is it a blow to kill all the Yau Clan and change the world?

900
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
Or are you going to die

901
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
with such a shameless and impudent plan?

902
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
You have no right to do anything.

903
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I don't know if you have it or not.

904
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
The first sect doesn't have it either.

905
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,160
My father is still waiting for me.

906
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Let me go back.

907
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I'll ask Uncle Bai to stay in the city.

908
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
You stay here first.

909
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
Even if you don't want to leave,

910
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
you'll stay here for ten years

911
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
to repay the kindness.

912
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
You'll stay here for ten years

913
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
to see your beautiful woman.

914
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I've done all the repaying.

915
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
But if I don't repay the kindness,

916
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
I'll abandon all the past.

917
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
I'll be a dog and a dog.

918
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
I'll be a dog and a dog.

919
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
I'm not going to say I'm grateful.

920
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I'll even be angry.

921
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Chongzhang,

922
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
I'll say it one last time.

923
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Let me go back.

924
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Don't force me to hate you.

925
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
I'll say it one last time.

926
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I have to break the law.

928
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
You're in trouble.

929
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
You can't break the law.

930
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
I won't let you die.

931
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
I'll protect Uncle Bai.

932
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Chongzhang.

933
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Chongzhang.

934
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Come back.

935
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Don't let me out.

936
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
Chongzhang.

937
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Chongzhang.

938
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Maybe after today,

939
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
we'll never be able to repay the kindness.

940
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Chongzhang.

941
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
But Uncle Bai.

942
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Chongzhang.

943
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Don't let me out.

944
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Chongzhang.

945
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
You're talking to me.

946
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
You're more important to me.

947
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Chongzhang.

948
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
It's you.

949
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
You're a ghost.

950
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
The master of the abyss,

951
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
the killer of the cave,

952
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
how can you care about my life?

953
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
You're not even our master.

954
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,160
I'll kill you.

955
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
I'll leave Ning'an City as soon as possible.

956
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
The cold palace is full of monsters.

957
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
The most important thing is to get rid of monsters.

958
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'll learn more from you.

959
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
It's all the demons.

960
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Every time.

961
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
No one can trust me.

962
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Now it seems that the demon and the ghost

963
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
might be the same person.

964
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
There's a thousand people in the cold palace.

965
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
The Immortal Sect can't fight with the cold palace at the same time.

966
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,160
We must first clear the real mess.

967
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,160
The key is still on that demon.

968
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
The evil spirit is coming.

969
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
The evil spirit is coming.

970
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
The evil spirit is coming.

971
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
The evil spirit is coming.

972
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
The evil spirit is coming.

973
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
The evil spirit is coming.

974
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
The evil spirit is coming.

975
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
The evil spirit is coming.

976
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
The evil spirit is coming.

977
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
The evil spirit is coming.

978
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
The evil spirit is coming.

979
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
The evil spirit is coming.

980
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
The evil spirit is coming.

981
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
The evil spirit is coming.

982
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
The evil spirit is coming.

983
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
The evil spirit is coming.

984
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
The evil spirit is coming.

985
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
The evil spirit is coming.

986
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
The evil spirit is coming.

987
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
The evil spirit is coming.

988
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
The evil spirit is coming.

989
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
The evil spirit is coming.

990
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
The evil spirit is coming.

991
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
The evil spirit is coming.

992
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
The evil spirit is coming.

993
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
The evil spirit is coming.

994
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
The evil spirit is coming.

995
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
The evil spirit is coming.

996
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
The evil spirit is coming.

997
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
The evil spirit is coming.

998
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
The evil spirit is coming.

999
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1000
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1001
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1002
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1003
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1004
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1005
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1006
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1007
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1008
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1009
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
The evil spirit is coming.

1010
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
The evil spirit is coming.
