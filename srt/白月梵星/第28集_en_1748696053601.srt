1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What are you thinking about?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,200
They decided to eat the corn, smell the corn, but then I, bluntly impale Elementara bought the storing place.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm going to be a little envious, but this place, maybe I'm going a little careless.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,120
3. No by using potatoes to separate the iceform fromgment4.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,920
Some whose are four rounded points at the stings.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,920
These areちはes sooo sharp that they're as perfect as mineshows.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,500
Aaaaaaaaaarrgghg,

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,820
This King man just won me another point.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm willing to be like a star, as a king, as a moon.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Time is here.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
We are here.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
I want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,820
You and him are not the same person.

15
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
Let's not say that.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,820
Only you can really audiences me show my love.

17
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,820
You bring each of us even 199 stars.

18
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,720
TheAnd instructed sprinkling the light to their hearts

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,760
Itwaking in the night

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,780
Watch the flame

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,980
Slowing down the garden

22
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,880
Water flowing away

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,260
Grandpa is dead

24
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,700
And I just am well

25
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,760
See the beautiful thing in the night

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,920
Cause I got, my eyes are ready

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,660
The goodness in my eyes

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,940
They watch the stars

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,820
There is no trick

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:48,820
I'll take you to the mountains and rivers and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains and mountains

31
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,260
Damn luck!

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
It's the most important thing in the world,

33
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
and it's been a long time since the last time we met.

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,820
So, it means that Lengquan Palace will definitely be under the control of time.

35
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
These days, it's hard for you.

36
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
You should go back to Lanling.

37
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Your teachers miss you too.

38
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
What are you doing?

39
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm asking for Master's help.

40
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Help?

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
The disciple of Zhenyu is also here.

42
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Yes.

43
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Nonsense!

44
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
How could you be with a demon girl?

45
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Fulin saved me from many troubles.

46
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
I was punished by Zhenyu.

47
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Now he has betrayed Lengquan and Zhenyu.

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Master saved him.

49
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Even if he betrayed Lengquan, he is still a demon.

50
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
How could you forget the evil deeds he did?

51
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
He is not a demon.

52
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
What did you say?

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
He is Bai Xi.

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Bai Xun's daughter.

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
A'Shu's sister?

56
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
What's going on?

57
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Zhenyu took Bai Xi away from the Bai family ten years ago.

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
He erased his memory and put it in his waist.

59
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
He made her a demon.

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I only recently found out that she is Bai Xi.

61
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Why did Zhenyu do that?

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
I don't know.

63
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
But Xie is innocent.

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
She was deceived by Zhenyu and made many mistakes.

65
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
Now she is also a rich man.

66
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Master, A'Xie is a human being.

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Please save her.

68
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Chongzhao.

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Fulin is a evil man.

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Even if he was a human being before,

71
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
he did everything he could to save her.

72
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Besides, he is a demon now.

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
He is a demon.

74
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I can't save him.

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Master.

76
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I can't kill him.

77
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I can't kill him.

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
Don't force yourself.

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
Don't force yourself.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I can't kill him.

81
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I can't kill him.

82
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
You are a demon.

83
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
You and he are not human.

84
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
You should go back to Lanling.

85
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
I can't go back to Lanling.

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Zhenyu's demon power is in my body.

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Master.

88
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
I can't go back.

89
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
You go back with master.

90
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Master wants to remove your physical power.

91
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
As you said,

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I have to take the medicine.

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
I will bring trouble to Lanling.

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Now A'Xie is alone.

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
I want to stay here.

96
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I will stay with her.

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
I will protect her.

98
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,820
You did all that you could to save Lanling.

99
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
You are always my good friend.

100
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
You are always my disciple.

101
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Since you don't want to go back,

102
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
you should stay in Ning'an City.

103
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
This is your home.

104
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
When you think of it, you should come back.

105
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
But

106
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Fulin is not the Bai Xi you used to be.

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Don't be angry with him.

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Otherwise,

109
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Master, you should stay here.

110
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Master.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
I am careless.

112
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I just want to stay here longer.

113
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
But don't worry.

114
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I will be back.

115
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
I will be back.

116
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I will be back.

117
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
I will go back with master.

118
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Master.

119
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Master.

120
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Don't worry.

121
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
But don't worry.

122
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I will catch Fan Yue.

123
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
And Bai Shu.

124
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
I will pay for everything.

125
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
I will come back.

126
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
As for Chong Zhou,

127
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
he thought he could bring Fulin

128
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and get everything out.

129
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
But he is still innocent.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
He has your hidden power.

131
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Wherever he goes,

132
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
I can find his treasure.

133
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
I want to go back to Ning An City.

134
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
If Leng Chenggong fails,

135
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
if A Xie can escape,

136
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
he will go back to Ning An City.

137
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Although I know the opportunity is very busy,

138
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I still want to go back to Ning An City.

139
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
What if he comes back?

140
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
Tian Hong, you stay here.

141
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
But master's health...

142
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Don't worry.

143
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
I am here.

144
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
I will use my life to protect you.

145
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
The one standing in the distance.

146
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Don't be afraid.

147
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
My heart will be...

148
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
I am Bai Shu.

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Please stay here.

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Please see master.

151
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Come to my place.

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
He let go of the word.

153
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
You are so bold.

154
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I am acquainted with master.

155
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
He should know Fan well.

156
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
You don't have a big business.

157
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
You are wasting your time.

158
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Why don't you come to practice?

159
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
I come here to practice free martial arts.

160
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
I can do anything.

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
You can do it.

162
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
What are you thinking?

163
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
A lot.

164
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
It was my first time here.

165
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
I remember our first encounter.

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
I remember you were fooling us.

167
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
I remember Tian Hu and Cang Shan.

168
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
We were fighting at the scene.

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
And we had a fight.

170
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Buji House used to be noisy.

171
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
I didn't expect it to be so quiet.

172
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Shu.

173
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,820
When everything is clear,

174
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
we will go back to Buji House.

175
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
And we will open it again.

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
If Xi can come back,

177
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
we will find him.

178
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Look.

179
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Mr. Xin is so good.

180
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Let me see.

181
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Yes.

182
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Not bad.

183
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Take one.

184
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
I can't take it.

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Take it and put it in the room.

186
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
I will take it.

187
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Come back next time.

188
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Okay.

189
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
You are awake.

190
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I just woke up.

191
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Have a try.

192
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
As you said,

193
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
I have no choice but to take the medicine.

194
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I will only bring trouble to Lan Ling.

195
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Now, Xi is alone.

196
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
I want to stay here.

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
With her.

198
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Protect her.

199
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Since you don't want to go back,

200
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
you can stay in Ning'an City.

201
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
This is your home.

202
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
When you think of it,

203
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
you can come back.

204
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
But,

205
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Fulin is not the same as before.

206
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
Don't be angry with her.

207
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Otherwise,

208
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,820
it's better to be here.

209
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Is it delicious?

210
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Nothing special.

211
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
It seems that you are still pregnant.

212
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
I will take good care of the baby tomorrow.

213
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
I will go out first.

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Where are you going?

215
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Your poison is not gone yet.

216
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
I will go get you some medicine.

217
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Take care of your home.

218
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Xi.

219
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
If you are still here,

220
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
you will like this place.

221
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
You always ask me

222
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
why I treat Chongzhang so well.

223
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Now I finally understand.

224
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I have liked him

225
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
for a long time.

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
But I can't live longer.

227
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
If I can think of him sooner,

228
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
it's better.

229
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
The door is open.

230
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Is Ashu back?

231
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
The door is open.

232
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Thank you, God.

233
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Thank you.

234
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
It's still not too late to go back.

235
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
I don't know what Fan Yue is doing now.

236
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Don't go!

237
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,500
Bless your mother.

238
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Help me! Help me!

239
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
The soul is dead.

240
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
It's a great deal.

241
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
In this way,

242
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
besides me,

243
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
there's still someone else to be changed.

244
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
He's dead.

245
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I'll never ask the life or death of the master.

246
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Save you.

247
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
It's a broken dream.

248
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
After I enter the mortal world next time,

249
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
maybe after thousands of years,

250
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
you'll be able to live for a hundred years.

251
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
How can I live for a hundred years?

252
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
How can I repay my debt?

253
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Fan Yuan.

254
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Uncle.

255
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
I'll tell you one thing.

256
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Say one thing.

257
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
The soul is dead.

258
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
There's no way I can save you.

259
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
My brother's soul is dead.

260
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
No matter how many years you go,

261
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
there's no way I can save you.

262
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Because I'm a person who can't be saved.

263
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm not going to let you die.

264
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I'm not going to let you die.

265
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I'm not going to let you die.

266
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I'm not going to let you die.

267
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Yongduo Di Yu

268
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Shuang, what's wrong with you?

269
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
You follow me

270
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
The body is in a coma

271
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Yongduo Di Yu

272
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
In this case

273
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Except me

274
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
How dare you say that?

275
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
In this case

276
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
In this case

277
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Except me

278
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
How dare you say that?

279
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
He is dead

280
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I never ask the living dead

281
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
You are the one who is broken

282
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
He is dead

283
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I never ask the living dead

284
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
You are the one who is broken

285
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
You are a mortal

286
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
You can't live for hundreds of years

287
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
How can you repay me?

288
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
You are a mortal

289
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
You can't live for hundreds of years

290
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
How can you repay me?

291
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
It's you

292
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
I am the one who is willing to live in the sea

293
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
It's you

294
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I can't see you

295
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I can't see you

296
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
I can't see you

297
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
The wind blows

298
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Shuang

299
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
You are the one who saved you

300
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
It's you

301
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Zitong

302
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Ziyue

303
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
You saved me

304
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
It's not me

305
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
I was still a criminal ten years ago

306
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I never left Bai Ze Zu

307
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
You saved your life

308
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
But you are not

309
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
My lord said

310
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
You have the spirit of demon god

311
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Why is the spirit of demon god still in the world ten years ago?

312
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
I don't know

313
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,820
I just

314
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
I was able to pass some of the spirit of demon god

315
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Maybe it's related to Ziyue

316
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
But the one who saved you was not me

317
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
I only miss you

318
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I was able to find the person who saved me

319
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
I know

320
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
You have been looking for him

321
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
But Fan Yue

322
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
When you saved me

323
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
I was only ten

324
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
I was so sorry for you

325
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
I was grateful

326
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
I was so proud

327
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
I can only do this

328
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
I was so proud

329
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
I can only do this

330
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
I care about you

331
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
I love you

332
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I am happy

333
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
I want to be with you forever

334
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
It's you

335
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Fan Yue

336
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
I am just happy

337
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I am happy that I finally found him

338
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Do you understand?

339
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
The regret that I have done

340
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Can't stop an answer

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
To the question of the past

342
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I embrace the choreo

343
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Divide the period

344
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Fulin

345
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
What's happened?

346
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Did I take the medicine?

347
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,140
It's still so serious.

348
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,940
I'll go and make you some more.

349
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,940
No, I'll get up as soon as I can.

350
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Why do you have to get your poison so serious?

351
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,540
You can't get your poison right?

352
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
What poison are you trying to get?

353
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,140
Don't ask anymore.

354
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,020
What poison I'm getting is all your fault.

355
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,900
Fine. You don't have to say.

356
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,780
I'll go and find Zhen Yuwen.

357
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,180
No!

358
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
He'll kill you.

359
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Then tell me what poison you're getting.

360
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,300
It's heart poison.

361
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
This poison is for Zhen Yuwen.

362
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,900
Other than him, he's not worth anything.

363
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,420
He doesn't have any other poison.

364
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,340
Uncle has come back to Ni'an City.

365
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,020
He can take the pill.

366
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,420
I'll take you to the Buji House to find him.

367
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,220
He'll be able to save you.

368
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,260
No! I don't want to see him!

369
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,500
Xi!

370
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
Xi!

371
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,980
Xi!

372
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,740
It's okay. It's okay.

373
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,260
I can't.

374
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,620
I can't see Uncle.

375
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm guilty.

376
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,740
I can't see him.

377
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,580
I can't see Uncle.

378
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,460
I'm guilty.

379
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,580
I can't see him.

380
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,140
I can't see him.

381
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,060
I can't see him.

382
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,820
It was our first trip in the sea.

383
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,740
I saw a swing there.

384
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,340
The hangover I saw on that person

385
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,940
was exactly the same as the hangover I was assigned to save me ten years ago.

386
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,740
I thought he was my benefactor.

387
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
I didn't expect to be so wrong.

388
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,340
But why didn't he deny my second chance to be pregnant?

389
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,940
By the way,

390
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,140
the look of the hangover is bright and lively.

391
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,740
Have you ever seen him in your memory?

392
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
No.

393
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
You said

394
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,740
he and the demon god have something to do with each other.

395
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,740
Who is he?

396
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,740
Why is he in the Moon Sea?

397
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,340
What does he mean by those words he told me?

398
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,740
I always feel that there are many things I can't understand.

399
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,140
He told you to restart your memory.

400
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,740
When we are back in the past five years, maybe we will meet again.

401
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
We will understand everything.

402
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,740
The Moon Sea has been sailing for ten thousand years.

403
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,340
There are still some surprises.

404
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,740
I have been interested in it for ten years.

405
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,940
You don't like the hand of Zhu Chan.

406
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
But this is a stone.

407
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,740
The demon god won't refuse it, right?

408
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Who is he?

409
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,340
What does it have to do with him?

410
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,140
Shu.

411
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,540
Shu.

412
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,340
Shu.

413
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Shu.

414
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,540
He is poisoned and has been in the valley for days.

415
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
Do you have any medicine for the pain?

416
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Fulin?

417
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
You can't kill him.

418
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
He has sent out the Cold Spring Palace.

419
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,140
He won't be in the prison anymore.

420
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
He is afraid that he won't send out the Cold Spring Palace.

421
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,740
It has nothing to do with me.

422
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,940
I only know my father's revenge.

423
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,740
Ning An Chen's revenge.

424
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,740
I have to report it.

425
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,540
But he knows the whereabouts of Xi.

426
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Where is Bai Xi?

427
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Let me go.

428
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,540
I told you that I won't come and go.

429
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,540
I said that I won't beg him.

430
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,140
Why did you have to bring me here?

431
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Tell me clearly.

432
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
Where is Bai Xi?

433
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,540
Since you know where Bai Xi is,

434
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
tell her.

435
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
Yes.

436
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,940
I do know where Bai Xi is.

437
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,740
Bai Xi is dead.

438
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,540
The weak and useless person like him

439
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,540
doesn't even have the courage to take the knife.

440
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,540
The first day of entering the Cold Spring Palace,

441
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,940
he is dead.

442
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
Impossible.

443
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I am weak.

444
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
But I am not weak.

445
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,940
He won't die like that.

446
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,540
You are lying to me.

447
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,940
You are definitely lying to me.

448
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,940
Tell me quickly. Where is Xi?

449
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Fuliang.

450
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
Fuliang.

451
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Shuo.

452
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
Save her.

453
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Now that I am injured,

454
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,540
you don't have to stay in the Cold Spring Palace.

455
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
I don't know why you have to

456
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,940
live with Fuliang.

457
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,540
I don't want to have any grudge between you.

458
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,540
But giving her the medicine is my biggest regret.

459
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Take her away.

460
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Shuo.

461
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
These days,

462
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I will remember what we were when we were little.

463
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,940
You, me, and Xi.

464
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
I know that Xi has been to the Cold Spring Palace.

465
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
But I have been to the Cold Spring Palace.

466
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
I didn't find Xi.

467
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,940
No one knows where he is.

468
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,540
He said Xi is dead.

469
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,740
But can I really believe him?

470
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
He killed so many people and made so many sins.

471
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,540
He killed my father.

472
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,140
So, Chongzhang told me.

473
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,740
He said Xi is dead.

474
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
Can I believe him?

475
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Shuo.

476
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,740
Actually, I want to find Xi like you.

477
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,540
But I can't answer you.

478
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
I always think you are smarter than me.

479
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,140
You are smarter than me.

480
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,340
I remember when my parents came to Nian'an City,

481
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,540
and opened a steamed bun shop.

482
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,540
I just don't understand.

483
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,140
As a fairy,

484
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,140
you can call yourself a fairy.

485
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,140
But you have to hide your identity and be a fairy.

486
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,340
You sell steamed buns every day.

487
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
Why can't you give up when people bully you?

488
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,140
You have to give up.

489
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,540
I fought with my parents every day.

490
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,540
My parents scolded me every day.

491
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,540
I was not happy at that time.

492
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,540
If you are bored,

493
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,140
why don't you sleep and have a good dream?

494
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,340
Wake up and wake up again.

495
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,540
I will wake up again.

496
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,940
I will wake up again.

497
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,940
I will wake up again.

498
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Wake up again.

499
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,740
Wake up.

500
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Wake up.

501
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Wake up.

502
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Wake up.

503
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,940
The sun is good today.

504
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,140
The wind is warm.

505
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,340
When the mood is warm,

506
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,940
it's sunny.

507
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Wake up.

508
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
The flower in the city is blooming.

509
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,940
It's beautiful.

510
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,140
If you have the time,

511
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,940
you will forget a lot of troubles.

512
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,940
I will wake up again.

513
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,940
I often give steamed buns to your family.

514
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
So I can recognize that

515
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,140
this is yours.

516
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,540
Give it to my sister.

517
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,540
If it's not for you,

518
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,140
I don't know how long I will be a good girl.

519
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,540
Thank you for the comforts you gave me.

520
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,540
Now this steamed bun,

521
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,940
I want to return it to you.

522
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,740
I have never written you any letters.

523
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,340
I am not the one who comforts you.

524
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
But this sachet...

525
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,340
This sachet is indeed mine.

526
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
But I gave it to Ah Xi in the afternoon.

527
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Will the person who sent you this letter

528
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,940
be Ah Xi?

529
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,940
I remember that he often went out secretly

530
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
when he was a little girl.

531
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,340
I asked him where he went.

532
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,540
He refused to tell me.

533
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,340
It seems that he went to you.

534
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,540
But I recognize your self.

535
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,340
I wrote it to Ah Xi.

536
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
I have always been a demon.

537
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
He is my own self.

538
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
Of course I am a traitor.

539
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
If you want to know clearly

540
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
what happened that year,

541
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,140
you can only find Ah Xi.

542
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Ask him.

543
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,340
I don't believe that Ah Xi will die like that.

544
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,140
Even if Fulin refused to tell me,

545
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,940
I will also find Ah Xi in my own way.

546
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,940
As for Fulin,

547
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,940
even if he betrays the cold power now,

548
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,140
it doesn't mean that he can be a villain.

549
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
It seems that I won't kill him

550
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
because he is my biggest honor.

551
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
But I won't save him.

552
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Take him away.

553
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Shuang.

554
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
Wu Nian Shi is indeed the god of the Star Moon.

555
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
His power can hurt me.

556
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,740
I need more power to repair the old mirror.

557
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,740
If it wasn't for that stupid lie in Lan Ling,

558
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,340
I wouldn't have wasted so many years.

559
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,940
I was in a trap.

560
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
I was in a trap.

561
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
I was in a trap.

562
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
I was in a trap.

563
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I was in a trap.

564
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
I was in a trap.

565
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I was in a trap.

566
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
I was in a trap.

567
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I was in a trap.

568
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,340
My dear,

569
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,340
if you try to kill yourself,

570
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,940
I will never let you go.

571
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Fan Yue.

572
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,140
What's wrong with you?

573
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm fine.

574
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Liar.

575
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,340
You've been acting weird today.

576
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,940
You seem to be hiding from me.

577
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,540
Can't you say something between us now?

578
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,740
It's master's Gui Ke.

579
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,540
Master said that he has many Gui Ke.

580
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,140
But this one never leaves the god.

581
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,940
He must have something wrong with this Gui Ke.

582
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,140
The old girl has been in Lan Ling.

583
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,740
She didn't hear Lan Ling's voice.

584
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,940
Gui Ke has a secret.

585
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
Dong.

586
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,340
Master said those words

587
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,740
because he didn't know who you are.

588
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,140
He's been looking for you for years.

589
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,940
Don't you want to meet him?

590
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,340
He wants to see his sister Bai Xi.

591
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
But look at me now.

592
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,740
I'm a man of blood.

593
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
I'm a bad man.

594
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
Why should I do that?

595
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,140
I'd rather Bai Xi is dead in his heart.

596
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,140
But...

597
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,740
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

598
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
What about you and me?

599
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,340
What about you and me?

600
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,740
You were the one who sent me the letter, right?

601
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

602
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
If you're in a bad mood,

603
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,940
why don't you sleep well and have a good dream?

604
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Wake up again.

605
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
The sun is very nice today.

606
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
The wind is warm.

607
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,540
When you're in a bad mood,

608
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
you should be sun-dried.

609
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
The flowers bloom in the city.

610
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,540
They're beautiful.

611
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,540
If you go to see them,

612
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,540
you'll forget about the troubles.

613
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Enough!

614
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Don't be sad.

615
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
But I've forgotten

616
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
what those words were.

617
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
I'm sorry.

618
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,740
The people in the wind

619
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,740
have seen so many times in their dreams.

620
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Do you remember those words?

621
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I've kept all the letters.

622
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I've not seen them many times in my life.

623
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
I always thought that that man was Shu.

624
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,740
I've kept him in my heart.

625
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
I knew it.

626
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
I knew it.

627
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740
But I've been wrong since the beginning.

628
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
I like Uncle An

629
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,940
because I can feel the comfort and comfort of those words.

630
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,940
But the opening and accompaniment of that time

631
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,940
actually came from you.

632
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
I'm just a fool.

633
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
I've been so old that I don't even know

634
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
that I've made a mistake.

635
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I've said it.

636
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,940
I've already forgotten.

637
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
You've forgotten?

638
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,940
As for the memories that I've erased,

639
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
when you don't remember anything,

640
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,940
you still keep them in your heart.

641
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,940
Because your heart has never changed.

642
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
What do you want to prove

643
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
after you've said so much?

644
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Yes.

645
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
After I've lost my memory,

646
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,940
I feel that I'm not a fool to anyone.

647
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
I'm a fool to you.

648
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
I still have a special feeling.

649
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
But Chongzhao,

650
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
you're a fairy, and I'm a demon.

651
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,940
I'm a demon who can do anything.

652
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
I can't be a demon anymore.

653
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
I have a demon now too.

654
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,940
And I've got the blood of the fairy.

655
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
You're forced to do that.

656
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Aren't you?

657
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
A 12-year-old girl

658
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
has never been gentle and kind.

659
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
She's been forced to do so.

660
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
But she's lost her memory

661
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
and lost her memory in the cold palace.

662
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,940
What can you do?

663
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,940
What can you do?

664
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
A Xin,

665
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
can you

666
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,940
let me stay by your side?

667
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Let me protect you.

668
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Let me protect you.

669
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Let me protect you.

670
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,940
Give us a chance to start.

671
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,940
Chongzhao,

672
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,940
I...

673
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
What's wrong?

674
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
What's wrong?

675
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,160
To the

676
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,940
North Hall of reservists,

677
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
your zookeeper

678
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
�시 Blake

679
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
let Daddy go open his do-it-all box.

680
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:15,060
Then his roestrie

681
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
will go close.

682
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,320
iles are known to you only.

683
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,260
Anyway,

684
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,540
when your revenge isn't even enough,

685
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,980
I don't know what should I do

686
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,300
about your success.

687
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,840
Aunt Fang,

688
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,160
what are you doing?

689
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,360
I can't do this.

690
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,980
We've been treated,

691
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,480
so you know the rest,

692
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,160
but don't bother me.

693
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,400
Though I've known you for so long,

694
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,120
I went to Xieologicalanya

695
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,960
to get your case.

696
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,280
Don't come back, Lian Ling.

697
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Go.

698
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
What Lian Ling?

699
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I don't understand.

700
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Aunt Meng, I'll help you go home.

701
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Go.

702
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
It's okay.

703
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Go.

704
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Dad.

705
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Call your dad to come and save Aunt Meng.

706
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Go.

707
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Xie...

708
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Xie, what's wrong?

709
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Chengzhao.

710
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Your mom is not dead in Xie Yao's hands.

711
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Before your mother died, I saw her.

712
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
What did you say?

713
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I didn't see her face.

714
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Zhen Ying Yue saw that she hurt your mother.

715
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,880
She wanted to kill me, but I was almost dead.

716
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
I don't know what happened.

717
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
You can't go back to Lan Ling.

718
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Is she being chased by Lan Ling?

719
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
No.

720
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
I'll tell master immediately.

721
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Let him know.

722
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
No.

723
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
You can't trust Lan Ling.

724
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Your master might be the one who killed your mother.

725
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
No way.

726
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
After my mother and father's death,

727
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,880
if it was my master, he wouldn't have killed me.

728
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
No one in this world could have killed me.

729
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
But my master wouldn't have.

730
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Besides, my master is always alive.

731
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
He wouldn't have done such a thing.

732
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
The Dragon Robe Knight brought us here.

733
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Could it be that master is in this village?

734
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
Do you know this village?

735
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
I've never heard of such a place on the East Road.

736
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
But the Dragon Robe Knight pointed to the village.

737
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Why don't we go in and have a look?

738
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
A single village is hiding in the forest.

739
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
It's a secret place.

740
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
I don't know if it's a secret place.

741
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
But the Dragon Robe Knight pointed to the village.

742
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Why don't we go in and have a look?

743
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
It's a unique village.

744
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
It's hidden in the forest.

745
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
A unique village is hidden in the forest.

746
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
It's a secret place.

747
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Let's go inside.

748
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Let's go.

749
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Come.

750
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Let's go inside.

751
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Let's go inside.

752
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Why is there a group of people on the land?

753
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,280
There are legal powers in this village.

754
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
They are not human beings.

755
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,980
This village is not simple.

756
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,480
Be careful.

757
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Come, have a look.

758
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Come and have a look.

759
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Gua Guo.

760
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,180
Who is the good one?

761
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Come again, Miss.

762
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Thank you.

763
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Boss, this is a great gift.

764
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
I'll get you a bag.

765
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Have a seat.

766
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Brother,

767
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,880
we are both from the outside world.

768
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
We are in a dead end.

769
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Where is this place?

770
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
This is the Pu Ticun village.

771
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,380
Only the people from the outside world can come here.

772
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,880
Welcome to the guest room.

773
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
People from the outside world?

774
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Yes.

775
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
This village is protected by the Goddess.

776
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Whether it is a poor family or a homeless family,

777
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,380
or a secluded family,

778
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,880
the Goddess will take care of all the people from the outside world.

779
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,380
We are all from the outside world.

780
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,380
Goddess?

781
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
That's right.

782
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,880
This village is protected by the Goddess.

783
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
We are all from the outside world.

784
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Yes.

785
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,380
The Goddess is not only legal and unlawful,

786
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,880
but also a kind and humble person.

787
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,880
She is the best person in the world.

788
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,380
If you see the Goddess,

789
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,880
you will definitely like her.

790
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
You will definitely like her.

791
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Yes.

792
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Yes, you will definitely like her.

793
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Let's go over there and take a look.

794
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,880
You said the Goddess in their mouth is a real person.

795
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
No matter it is a real person,

796
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
it is not easy to hide so many ancestors and ancestors

797
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
and not go out of the world.

798
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
This person is definitely not simple.

799
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Look, the Goddess is here.

800
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
I have already said that

801
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,880
if you enter this village,

802
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
you will be a family.

803
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
You don't need to be polite.

804
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
You can do whatever you want.

805
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
What is this?

806
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
This Goddess,

807
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
you...

808
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I finally got to wait for you.

809
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
What...

810
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
What's going on?

811
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I don't know.

812
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
What's wrong with the Goddess?

813
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,380
I don't know.

814
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,380
She is the one who is waiting for you.

815
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
No way.

816
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
The Goddess has been waiting for her for so long.

817
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,380
Why is she now having other girls around her?

818
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
I'm not sad.

819
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
What does she mean?

820
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
You know her?

821
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
I have never seen her before.

822
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
You don't remember me anymore?

823
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
It has been so long since I last saw her.

824
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,880
You have forgotten everything until now.

825
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
It's okay.

826
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
If you forget,

827
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
you will get to know her again.

828
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
The flowers are not in the stream.

829
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
The bamboo leaves are not in the sky.

830
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I am now called

831
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
the bamboo.

832
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
You are the bamboo.

833
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Why don't you meet me?

834
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
You are the bamboo.

835
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Yes.

836
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
The bamboo is white.

837
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
It's getting late.

838
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I will not be with you.

839
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
We are in the village.

840
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
We are here to find someone.

841
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Please ask if there are any other people

842
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,880
in the village other than us.

843
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Yes.

844
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Hurry up.

845
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,380

My heart will always guide you to me

851
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,380
You are the light I want to see

852
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,380
