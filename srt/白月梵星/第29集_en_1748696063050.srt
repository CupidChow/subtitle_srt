1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
On our next episode…

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm willing to be as good as the stars and the moon.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are in this world.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is the reason for the past?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What is the reason for the past?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is the reason for the past?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I only want to see every star and moon with the one I love.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to be with you forever.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a book.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You and her are not the same person.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The fairy demon is a book.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You and her are not the same person.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You and her are not the same person.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I only want to see every star and moon with the one I love.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The fairy demon is a book.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You and her are not the same person.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The fairy demon is a book.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You and her are not the same person.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The fairy demon is a book.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You and her are not the same person.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The fairy demon is a book.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You and her are not the same person.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The fairy demon is a book.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Episode 19

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We are in the village.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We are here to find someone.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you have any other people besides us?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well...

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Master.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Are you okay?

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Of course.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm fine.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What can I do for you?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You saved me yesterday.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm willing to stay here.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you for saving my master.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
As long as I'm a good person, I'll protect you.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Since my master has found us, we'll leave.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Goodbye.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's almost dark.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's the meaning of that?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a good village.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We'll stay here for a few days.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't think the two guests will mind.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're welcome.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can stay here for long.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's too easy to live with you.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're still young and have a face.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not us.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They're so kind.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They're the master of the House of House of House.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not what you think.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not what I think.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your eyes were not opened from the mess.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Master, it's late.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sleepy.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going back to sleep.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Master, I have something to ask you.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm leaving.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll open the door for you.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is she keeping in her memory of that woman?

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or is she just dreaming and absorbing it?

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who in theü.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why is he in the hands of the woman in Jingyuan's memory?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is he really in love with Jingyuan?

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We must ask her this matter.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Otherwise, we can't explain it to her.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tu'er, I've told you before.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This man is just unbelievable.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Since you've already told me, why didn't you tell me?

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you know that I've been worried about you all day?

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't be mad.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was really in danger yesterday.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Zhenyu chased me halfway.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was so scared that I was in danger.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Luckily, I was saved by the woman in the mess.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I saw that the village was so fresh.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I forgot about it after a while.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How could Zhenyu chase you?

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lanling has a mutual understanding.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How could he break the mutual understanding?

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's all my fault.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been so lucky.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've been taken by the forest grass.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was thinking of going to the surrounding forest to find a new demon.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was looking for Zhenyu as soon as I found the new one.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I came all the way to the east.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why did he chase you?

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you have any grudge?

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Actually, it's not a big deal.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Many years ago, he asked me to keep him.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I lied to him.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He was angry with me for not being able to find me.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's all because of the mess in the village.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't care.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Lanling is the first one to be released.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You'd better hide here.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You'd better take Lanling with you.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've figured it out.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Lanling is a big sister.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Big sister?

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What big sister?

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I didn't figure it out.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Anyway, this place is the best.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You see, there's a mess.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's a mysterious woman.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's no way to find this Bodhi Village.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's the safest place.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're a ghost.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you had to stay in this Bodhi Village,

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think I'd be the big sister.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's the big sister?

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You really didn't see it or you didn't see it?

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That mess is very suspicious to Fan Yue.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Master, let me ask you.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What is this Bodhi Village?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Who is the mess?

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I didn't hear about this Bodhi Village before.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I only know that people here are used to the mess.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They call it Goddess.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They say it's been a long time since she's been alive.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's said that she's been waiting for a lover

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
for 60,000 years.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
60,000 years ago?

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If the mess and the gods are related,

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fan Yue and the demon gods are the same.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What if they're really...

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What?

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Demon gods and gods?

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What do you mean?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why didn't you talk to me?

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who are you?

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's your relationship with Jingyuan?

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The ancient god fish,

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the white-haired one,

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and the days of the Star Moon Pavilion.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you really forget?

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
After I returned from the palace,

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I did see some pictures in my mind.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I know that it's Jingyuan's memory.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There's a woman in her memory.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Although I can't see her clearly,

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I saw her bracelet.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's like the one you have.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So you came to me

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
not because you remembered me,

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but because of this bracelet?

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Although I don't want to attack you,

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but from the current situation,

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you're very dangerous.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're always showing your signs.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The mess and the gods are just a pair.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So you mean

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm the one who came in?

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I shouldn't be with Fan Yue.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I didn't say that.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The love between the mess and the gods

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is something that happened six million years ago.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The one who likes Fan Yue is you.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know that.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But, Tu'er,

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
because I'm your master,

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I hope you can think it through.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Although you have the spiritual power now,

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you're still a human being.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're not good enough for a hundred years.

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And you said that

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Fan Yue has the demon and the gods.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're so good at it.

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Do you think it's really appropriate for you two to be together?

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Even if you're together,

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the relationship is just for decades.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When you're in your eyes,

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
you can't care less about who he's with.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Then you think

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Wan Zhuhuo should be a pair.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't think so.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just hope you can be good.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't make yourself feel wronged.

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Even if Fan Yue is not good enough,

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
don't be too upset.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Men are too much.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They don't lack a single thing.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Six million years ago,

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you were the demon and the gods.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm the goddess and the moon.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We've been together for a hundred years.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You promised me that

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you'll be forever.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Forget it.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You've forgotten everything.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll be forever.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's the point?

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't remember

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
what happened 60,000 years ago.

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I know

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that I'm the one who's determined

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to be the one.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that I've met him today.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's smart and clever.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He's very energetic.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
From him,

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
he's very good.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I feel like I've met myself.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But compared to the past,

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
he's got more courage.

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He's got the courage to love.

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's a good girl.

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Since you chose him,

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
you should go on.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Go back.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Just pretend that you've never been here.

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go back and live your life well.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's late.

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Go back.

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't let him misunderstand.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Go back.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Go back.

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
60,000 years

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's been so long.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I finally can't wait for you.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This time,

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll never let you

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
be a part of anybody.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You finally understand.

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
To go back to Lanling

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is the right way.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm very happy.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Could it be that you will return to Lanling this time?

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And you have other plans?

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Since father and mother died,

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
master has been like father and mother,

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
raising me, teaching me how to cast spells and cast spells.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Chongzhao has never thought about master.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But today,

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Chongzhao still wants to ask master again.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is my father and mother really

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the hands of the demon clan?

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you questioning master?

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Chongzhao doesn't dare to.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But Xi has already restored most of his memories.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He said my mother had seen him before he died.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He also told me not to return to Lanling.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You believe him?

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Chongzhao doesn't believe me.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But Xi won't lie to me.

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You want to make Li Jian and Lanling understand each other?

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You are the one who can help.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But you are the one who can help him.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's my fault.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I shouldn't have sent you to the Lanquan Palace.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's my fault.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I should have called you back earlier.

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Now you are fighting with the demon girl.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's Lanling's fault.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I really hate you.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Chongzhao has no intention.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But...

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is the death of father and mother.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have been pressing on my heart.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Chongzhao has never forgotten.

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Since you are so obsessed with the truth,

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I am willing to take you to investigate your parents' death.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Tell me, what else did he see?

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What else did he see?

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He saw someone.

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Who?

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He was standing in the garden.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He didn't see anyone's face.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But he saw it with his own eyes.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He saw my mother badly.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And that day,

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it was my parents' death.

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's the reason for that?

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What's the magic?

283
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's your mother's last name?

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She just got pregnant.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
She was hurt by a man from behind.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She got in a coma.

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
She had no other choice.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How can we calculate the clues?

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if she didn't lie to you,

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
but time is far away.

291
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How can you be sure that she didn't remember the wrong thing?

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I am not sure.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I remember it wrongly.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Chongzhao, I understand.

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chongzhao, I am sorry for you.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I also thank you.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You are very kind.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't get too close to Chongzhao.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Take care.

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I will take my leave.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You really want to go back to him?

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You are going to kill him.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He has been alone for too long.

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't go back with him.

305
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No matter what the future holds.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I just went to find the wrong person.

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then?

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
She said she was a goddess of the heart.

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
60,000 years ago,

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
she had a past with the demon god Qingyuan.

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She was so happy.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But she didn't know that she was a demon.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
She didn't know that she was a demon.

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
She was so happy.

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
She was so happy.

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She was so happy.

317
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
She was so happy.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
She was so happy.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She was so happy.

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
She was so happy.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think Qingyuan had a past.

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What past?

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The mountain is cold.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Life and death are familiar.

325
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So you knew all these before you entered the Bodhi Village?

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't know all of them.

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just saw some pictures.

328
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Qingyuan wore a bracelet for a woman.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And that bracelet

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
was the same as the one in the hands of the demon god.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So I wanted to find out.

332
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It seems that

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
it's indeed an old poem.

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
An old poem?

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's the old poem.

336
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm Fan Yue.

337
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
My poem is only one.

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's you.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're so sweet.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But you already have her memory and shadow in your mind.

341
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're starting to be so considerate of me.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I was so considerate of you

343
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
because I didn't know who she was.

344
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why did she appear in my mind?

345
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Now I know.

346
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's just a memory of Qingyuan.

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It has nothing to do with me.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I won't hide anymore.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
How do you want to prove it?

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I won't hide anymore.

351
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Actually,

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
when Qingyuan saved me,

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
she said something.

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The god Yi Fei took over the world.

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You should know

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that there is a pair of eyes that are similar to her.

357
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I didn't know who she was in the golden circle.

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I didn't know who was the man.

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now it seems

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that it's just a memory of her.

361
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's just a memory of Qingyuan.

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm so glad that I can tell you

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
that I only arranged

364
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to tell you about her in the future.

365
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
By the way,

366
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Master doesn't want to leave Puti Village.

367
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I plan to stay and watch her for a few days.

368
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'll leave after I'm sure of it.

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

370
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll stay with you.

371
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Here.

372
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Welcome to the guest room.

373
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please enjoy the soup.

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Thank you.

375
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Smells good.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Boss, how much is this?

377
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is not enough.

378
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's called Puti Village.

379
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There are many delicious food and drinks.

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You can have it if you want.

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You can have it if you want.

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's free.

383
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Here, Miss.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Thank you.

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're welcome.

386
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If all the people in the world

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
are as good as the villagers in Puti Village,

388
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
then there will be no evil and evil.

389
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There will be no golden and silver.

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I always think that this village is too far away.

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why?

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You think it's not right?

393
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It seems that it's too far away.

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There will be another scene behind.

395
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Fengyu,

396
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
when the five years of the season are over,

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we can find a place like this

398
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to settle down and live a life

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that is as good as theirs.

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I agree.

401
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But the important thing is

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
to be with you.

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's go.

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Be careful.

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You just got out of the pot.

406
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Take it.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Take it.

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Be careful.

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Uncle Cheng.

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Uncle Meng.

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Uncle and Auntie.

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I miss you so much.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Have you been here for the past ten years?

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We've been hiding here to avoid being caught.

416
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Who is going to catch you?

417
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I know that the truth is not good for you.

418
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We've been hiding here for these years.

419
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We didn't ask for the truth.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We didn't even bother to call the Chongzhao.

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You've had a good time.

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Just treat us as dead.

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How can that be?

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
For the past ten years,

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Chongzhao never gave up

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and investigated your real death.

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He doesn't believe that you were killed by the demons.

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If Chongzhao knew that you were still alive,

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he would be so happy.

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Uncle Cheng.

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Since they have a hard time,

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
don't force them.

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I didn't mean to ask.

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is...

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is the owner of the Hall of Fame, Fan Yue.

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He knows Chongzhao.

437
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hall of Fame?

438
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We haven't heard of Hall of Fame

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
since we came here.

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We haven't been to the Bodhi Village for ten years.

441
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It seems that we don't know the outside world anymore.

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a matter of time.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They are young.

444
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They have their own world.

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Shu'er.

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Since we meet again here,

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we should treat each other well.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Aunt will cook you something delicious.

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Come on, let's eat.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Come on. Let's have a gift.

451
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you think that

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
the dream of Chongzhao is weird?

453
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Uncle Chong and Aunt Meng

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
are also the top of the Lanling.

455
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Who is chasing after them?

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
They forced them to stay here.

457
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Since they don't even see Chongzhao,

458
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
they must hide behind this.

459
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Maybe only Chongzhao comes here

460
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so that they can tell the truth.

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Besides, I've been with Chongzhao for ten years.

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I know how much he can't let his parents go.

463
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This is a very important matter.

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I hope that Chongzhao can arrive here

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and reunite with his parents soon.

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Mr. Mole Yu

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Ms. Shen,

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
We're wrong.

469
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
We shouldn't let Uncle Bai see us.

470
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,720
We've been lying to you.

471
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
Please forgive us.

472
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,080
It's okay if we make mistakes.

473
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
But if we make mistakes,

474
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,720
we'll be punished.

475
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,560
Am I right?

476
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,920
Please forgive us.

477
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,680
We must hide ourselves.

478
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,120
Uncle Bai will never see us again.

479
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,280
Since the show is on,

480
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,960
how can we keep it up?

481
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,200
You don't just want to let Uncle Bai see us,

482
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,280
you should welcome your son, Chongzhao,

483
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,320
to the Pure Land.

484
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,320
I was too excited.

486
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,720
I shouldn't hurt you.

487
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,800
We're a family

488
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
that we love each other.

489
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,360
Do you still listen to me?

490
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,800
Always be loyal to God.

491
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,240
Is your son coming?

492
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,320
Do you miss him?

493
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
No.

494
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,600
He's your own son.

495
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,720
It's been ten years.

496
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,360
Of course, you should think about it.

497
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
You don't just want to think about it,

498
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,920
but you also need to find out more

499
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,320
about Uncle Bai from Chongzhao.

500
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Do you understand?

501
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,560
Yes.

502
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,480
That's why...

503
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,560
You sent me off with this hour.

504
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,860
Until the one who saved you

505
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,560
came to get you from here.

506
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,120
You didn't settle down

507
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,520
with a big spanking.

508
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,220
You even香港edumblesuru

509
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Then this grudge is the enemy.

510
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
I will find out the truth.

511
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
I won't have any more worries.

512
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,240
The

513
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
What's wrong?

514
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Shiya said that my parents are still alive.

515
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
They have been protecting the Pu Ti Village.

516
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Pu Ti Village?

517
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,220
I have never heard of this place in the north of Zongnan.

518
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
Ashou won't be confused.

519
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
He must have seen my parents.

520
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I saw my mother was killed by the assassins.

521
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Did someone save her after I got married?

522
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,220
No matter what, I want to get to the Pu Ti Village right away.

523
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,220
If you don't want to see Ashou, you can stay here and wait for me.

524
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
I'll go with you.

525
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,220
How do you want to face her?

526
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,220
I won't hurt her, but I won't admit that I'm Bai Xi.

527
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
I respect your decision.

528
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,220
And I won't mention anything to Ashou.

529
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,220
But I still want to tell you that you are Bai Xi's true form.

530
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
You will never change.

531
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
One day, you will meet each other.

532
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Xi, don't ask yourself for the past.

533
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
You don't want that.

534
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
You are also a victim.

535
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,220
I believe Ashou will understand you and will love you.

536
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,220
I'll pack up and then go.

537
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Ashou, my parents are in this village.

538
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Is it true?

539
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,220
Why did you bring her here?

540
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
It's my idea.

541
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
I don't want to hide anything from her.

542
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
Are you really going to be with her?

543
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
Yes.

544
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
I'm not going to hide anything from her.

545
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
I'm not going to hide anything from her.

546
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
I'm not going to hide anything from her.

547
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Are you really going to be with her?

548
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Yes.

549
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Your parents are more important now.

550
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
I won't talk to her for now.

551
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,220
But I will talk to her about the debt she owed me.

552
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
It's getting late.

553
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Let's go to the village.

554
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
The village is closed.

555
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
The village is closed.

556
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
The village is closed.

557
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
The village is closed.

558
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
The village is closed.

559
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
The village is closed.

560
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
The village is closed.

561
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
The village is closed.

562
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
The village is closed.

563
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
The village is closed.

564
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
The village is closed.

565
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
The village is closed.

566
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
The village is closed.

567
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
The village is closed.

568
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Don't leave me.

569
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Don't leave me.

570
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Dad, mom, I'm back.

571
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Zhang Er.

572
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Zhang Er.

573
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Slow down.

574
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Dad.

575
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Mom.

576
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Mom.

577
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
Zhou Er.

578
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,220
I know you are not a good girl.

579
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
I know.

580
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,220
I've been looking for you for a long time.

581
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I finally found you.

582
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,220
But no matter how many times I look at you,

583
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,220
I still remember you.

584
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Come, Zhao Er.

585
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
Sit down.

586
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Zhao Er.

587
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
You've grown up.

588
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Dad.

589
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Mom, what is this place?

590
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,220
Why haven't you come back to Lanling for so many years?

591
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,220
You still live without telling me?

592
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Zhao Er.

593
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
We are here for you.

594
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
For me?

595
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Back then, we were in the city of Ning'an.

596
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
We often chased the demons.

597
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
We fought for a long time.

598
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
We were so busy.

599
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
We were not told by the demons.

600
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
We were also annoyed by some of the ancestors.

601
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
They were so excited about us.

602
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,220
It took a long time to get to the end.

603
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,220
The last time we fought with the demons,

604
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
your mom and I were supposed to go back to Lanling to pay our respects.

605
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,220
But we were attacked by other ancestors on the way back.

606
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
We were seriously injured.

607
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,220
We were planning to escape to the village of Puti.

608
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
But Xianyuan was already dead.

609
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
The master of this place saved us.

610
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,220
It's been three years since we woke up.

611
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Xianyuan is dead?

612
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
No wonder you were so blind.

613
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
But Xianyuan is dead.

614
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,220
What is the real reason for the master of this place?

615
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
He could have died.

616
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
Zhao Er.

617
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
We can't talk too much.

618
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I can only tell you that the master of this place is very capable.

619
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
Thanks to him,

620
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
we can live with your dad.

621
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,220
We were going to look for you when we woke up.

622
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,220
But we heard that Lanling thought we were dead.

623
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,220
And you were also the first disciple of the Jin family.

624
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,220
And you were taken back to the house by the master of Bai Xun.

625
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,220
What does it have to do with you not coming back to me?

626
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
We are too far away from home.

627
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
Once we are out of the house,

628
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,220
someone will take revenge.

629
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
It's not good for you.

630
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,220
You are the safest place to be when you grow up.

631
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Look at me.

632
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
I'm talking to myself.

633
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm forgetting my family and guests.

634
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Don't be angry, aunt.

635
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
I made the decision myself.

636
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I didn't ask you to agree to bring the revenge.

637
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Uncle, don't say that.

638
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Thank you.

639
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Thanks to you,

640
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
we can be together.

641
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
It's our good fortune.

642
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Uncle.

643
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,220
Xi.

644
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,220
You must stay with aunt today.

645
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Have a good time.

646
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Mom.

647
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
She is not Xi.

648
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
She is my friend, Fulin.

649
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Sorry, miss.

650
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I saw you have some noodles.

651
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
And you came with Zhao Er.

652
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I thought you were...

653
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
Aunt.

654
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
I'll help you with anything.

655
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
You are a guest.

656
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
How can you work?

657
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,220
Sit down and talk.

658
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
I'll cook something delicious for you.

659
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Sit down.

660
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Just like your own home.

661
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Do you have any doubts?

662
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
No.

663
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
What can I doubt?

664
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
Fulin.

665
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,220
Fulin is not Xi.

666
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
If you have no doubts,

667
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
why do you have to be so anxious to deny it?

668
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
Actually, we did mess up one thing.

669
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,220
For so many years,

670
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
I and I have only two disciples.

671
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
One is Qi Feng.

672
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
The other is Fulin.

673
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,220
I took Qi Feng with me that year.

674
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Qi Feng was the one who took him away.

675
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,220
What about Fulin?

676
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Why did he leave Fulin with me?

677
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
That's why he stayed with me.

678
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Bai Xi was the one who sent people to disguise as Taoists.

679
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
He was deceived by the people in the city.

680
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
You also saw him in Qi Feng's memory.

681
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
Since he took back the money,

682
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
he wouldn't kill him.

683
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
If he didn't kill him,

684
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
he would have the right to be a hero.

685
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
There is another possibility.

686
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
He didn't leave Bai Xi alone for so many years.

687
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
It's just a coincidence.

688
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
Xi is human.

689
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Fulin is a demon.

690
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
He is not Xi.

691
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Impossible.

692
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Impossible.

693
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
There is a new guest.

694
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Don't worry, Goddess.

695
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
Although Chong Zhao asked many questions today,

696
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
they were all explained by us.

697
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
They are not Qi.

698
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Qi?

699
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
They are all smart people.

700
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Even Qi is normal.

701
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Don't be afraid.

702
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
I'm not angry.

703
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
They entered the Bodhi Village.

704
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
I won't let them out again.

705
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,220
No one can leave.

706
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Wait.

707
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
I have something to ask you.

708
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
I have nothing to do with you.

709
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
Why did you come to Lengquan Palace?

710
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,220
When did you come to Lengquan Palace?

711
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,220
What do you feel about me?

712
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
I've been thinking.

713
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
If Zhenyu hid Xi Feng's identity,

714
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
and also hid Xi,

715
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
she would turn him into Chen Ye.

716
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Then my sister, Xi,

717
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
who would she let him become?

718
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Bai Shou, you are so ridiculous.

719
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Do you think I am Bai Xi?

720
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Did you forget what I did?

721
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
I remember.

722
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
You did something.

723
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
You pretended to be strong.

724
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
I never forgot.

725
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
So, how could you

726
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,220
dare to make such a wish?

727
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Yes.

728
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
It's a wish.

729
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
It's a wish that can't be thought of.

730
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
It's a wish that can't be lost.

731
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
If my sister is still alive,

732
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
if you are her,

733
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
I just want to ask you why.

734
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Why would she become

735
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
a man of the heart?

736
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,220
Why would she do everything for you?

737
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Why would she commit suicide and die?

738
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Why would she keep an eye on him?

739
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Look at her.

740
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
She is dead in front of him.

741
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
If you are not her,

742
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
why did you promise?

743
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
So, you care so much about that person who died long ago.

744
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
No matter how much I care about him,

745
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
you would rather be her than me.

746
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
To be honest,

747
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
if you really want to make your family better,

748
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
and make the antidote for Shixing Tribe,

749
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
I can consider making Bai Xi your wife.

750
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
A person like you

751
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
will never be my A-Xi.

752
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,220
I'm afraid that the wind will turn away my thoughts.

753
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
It will be a little bit more painful.

754
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,220
That year, that year,

755
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,220
the summer will be full of flowers.

756
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
I will be like a map,

757
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,220
to hide my thoughts and make them all the same.

758
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I remember that month,

759
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,220
the flower that bloomed once in my life.

760
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,220
I remember that moment,

761
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,220
but I can't remember the answer.

762
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I remember that the tears that I shed

763
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
were not your fault.

764
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,220
I can't see the person I want to see.

765
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,220
I don't know how much I miss you.

766
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,220
That year, that year,

767
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,220
the summer will be full of flowers.

768
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
I will be like a map,

769
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,220
to hide my thoughts and make them all the same.

770
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,220
That year,

771
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,220
that year,

772
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,220
the summer will be full of flowers.

773
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Well,

774
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,220
don't tell me you are personified by the Vietnam.

775
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,220
No, 음,

776
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,220
some major has to be required

777
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
from earth,

778
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,220
that's not what people understand.

779
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,220
Is it impossible or fate?

780
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,420
I used to think that people's memories are in the world

781
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,060
and that they can't live a life without the muddle.

782
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,260
I should ask everything clearly.

783
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,060
I want to know more.

784
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,180
But today I suddenly feel that

785
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
maybe muddle is also a good thing.

786
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,380
I understand your feelings.

787
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,180
Do you know who you're looking for now?

788
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,380
Like when I was in the tribe

789
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,100
facing the wind and the fire.

790
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,820
I understand your anxiety and hesitation.

791
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,620
Fengyu, we should leave here tomorrow.

792
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,860
We came here to find our master.

793
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,860
Now master is safe and sound.

794
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,700
He doesn't want to leave Pu Ti Village.

795
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
He can't force himself.

796
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,940
And Chongzhao,

797
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,980
he has already been reunited with his parents.

798
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,820
I don't need him anymore.

799
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,180
Let's go.

800
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,940
Keep missing him.

801
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,940
Keep looking for Xi.

802
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,460
Okay?

803
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,860
No matter what decision you make,

804
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,180
I will always be with you.

805
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,020
There are only two bedrooms in the family.

806
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
My parents only have one.

807
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,420
Only this one.

808
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,900
You sleep in the bed.

809
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,180
I'll sleep on the floor.

810
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,340
Chongzhao,

811
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,140
let's stay in Pu Ti Village, okay?

812
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,060
You and Uncle and Aunt have separated for so many years.

813
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,700
Let's stay and stay with them, okay?

814
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,460
I just said that you don't need to go to the heart.

815
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,660
I'll leave tomorrow.

816
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,140
I didn't mean that.

817
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,520
I just think something is not right.

818
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,700
Is it not?

819
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,780
Mom and dad always go as principles,

820
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,420
they Karl Rumor틥 hurts,

821
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,420
they turn a blind eye to ask for mercy.

822
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,060
They couldn't hear the spirit No. 15

823
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,060
from the Fairy Sword.

824
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,460
And they're now in pain.

825
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,260
It doesn't bother to prepare for arió.

826
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,780
It takes time

827
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,060
to change a century-old rules thing for ten years

828
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,420
let alone this.

829
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,740
Maybe Uncle and Auntie

830
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,020
will have to pay for their short-term Both are different.

831
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,780
Then I hope it'll be the case.

832
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,340
But as enemies will fall,

833
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,580
it's better not to think long and hard.

834
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,220
Didn't you notice that they've explained a lot of things to me since they met me?

835
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,220
But they never asked me anything.

836
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
How did I grow up?

837
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Did I live well?

838
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,220
It's a good night.

839
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
You should have some good dreams.

840
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,220
Just bring it on.

841
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Just bring it on.

842
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
The Falls ofooooo

843
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,220
A Yuan who's the new King of the Net.

844
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,780
Good.

845
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,880
Jingyuan.

846
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,440
To see you

847
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,900
and to fall in love with you

848
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,220
is an unusual and boring thing

849
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,500
in my life.

850
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,220
I'm here because you want me

851
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:02,220
Come on, come on

852
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:10,220
My heart is so excited

853
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,220
Wait for me

854
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:21,220
I'm sorry for your eyes

855
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,220
You are the light I want to see

856
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,220
It's a lonely journey

857
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:37,220
Let this moment be with you

858
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:44,220
I want to be with you

859
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:51,220
I want to see you

860
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,220
You are the light I want to see

861
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,220
It's a lonely journey

862
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:07,220
Let this moment be with you

863
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:16,220
I want to be with you

864
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,220
I want to be with you
