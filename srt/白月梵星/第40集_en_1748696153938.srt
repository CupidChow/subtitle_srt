1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's anti- decibel

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:27,820
This city is in seriously desperate times

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
100,000,000 miles.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A union of grape juice andจ Brewing Wine.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
icide line.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's bright and bright, I wanna fly on.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:23,020
I choose this while

15
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,000
Waves flare, wavesy-wazen

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
ADV

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Cast a spell on me

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,820
That which cannot skew through the eye

19
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,280
AndQué

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,020
I will sink down to the deep sea

21
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,940
While I'll rock upon the deep sea

22
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,020
Then I sports a fad

23
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:44,700
Enlightened by the註

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,960
Answer

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I just want to finish what I haven't done in 60,000 years.

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
So, no matter if you're lucky or not,

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll marry you with this face.

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
You can't choose.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Before I promise you, I want to change your promise.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Say it.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Don't hurt any of these creatures in this world.

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Since you killed them, they're like a rebel to you.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Why do you do these boring things?

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,960
If you're willing to talk to me about the status of the Shadow Lord,

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll change your promise.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Okay.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
I promise you.

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Tomorrow, the Moon and the Moon Sea

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
will be our wedding place.

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
The Moon and the Moon Sea has already been separated.

41
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
60,000 years ago,

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Jingyuan could build a Star Moon Pavilion for the Star Moon Pavilion in the Demon Clan.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,960
I can also build the Moon and the Moon Sea for you on this East Road.

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I want everything to be the same as 60,000 years ago.

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Your Highness,

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
everything is right.

47
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Everyone has their own responsibility.

48
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,960
I sacrifice myself for the future of the Hu Clan.

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I want to live in peace for the sake of my family.

50
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I want to live a life of prosperity.

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
I want to protect the reputation of the Hu Clan.

52
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
I want to live a life of prosperity.

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I want to live a life of prosperity.

54
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I want to live a life of prosperity.

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
To protect the world,

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I want to live a life of prosperity.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,960
And I have my own job.

58
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,960
The Moon and the Moon

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,960
The Moon and the Moon

60
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
The Moon and the Moon

61
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
This Soul Land is the same as the one 60,000 years ago.

62
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Try it on.

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
You will wear it.

64
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
No matter if it's a wedding or a master's,

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I will take it all back.

66
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Stop it.

67
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
What's the meaning of all this?

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
The meaning?

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm not the meaning of this world.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
If you are so arrogant,

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
you will never understand the true meaning of the world.

72
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Even if you have the power of the ten thousand years,

73
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
it's just a lack of it.

74
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Only if you can find the meaningless meanings.

75
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I can see all the evil thoughts in the world

76
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
even if I'm the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.

77
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
No matter if it's the immortal, the demon, the human or the human,

78
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,960
all the creatures have their own ugly sides.

79
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,960
It's the same as the one 60,000 years ago and 60,000 years later.

80
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
It's not easy to change the meaning of time.

81
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Is this the meaning of your will?

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
There are evil in the world.

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,960
There is the meaning of existence in front of evil.

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm not talking nonsense with you.

85
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,960
After the wedding tomorrow, you will be my god.

86
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,960
All the evil in the world has nothing to do with you.

87
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't fight for nothing.

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You have been a god for five years and have become weak.

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
You can't turn back.

90
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
No.

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Tianhuang.

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Your Highness, you're awake.

93
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Where is the recording?

94
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
The Starry Night is ready.

95
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
How are we doing?

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
This time,

97
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,060
....

98
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
It's...

99
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,960
It's hurting.

100
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
так!

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Now it's okay.

102
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
It's me who's in pain.

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,960
It's me.

104
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
What's with the 謝謝?

105
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Why are you So sad?

106
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,120
I didn't report to the owner in advance.

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,440
The owner won't blame me, right?

108
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Tian Hu!

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,880
Tian Hu, what's wrong?

110
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Why do you not recognize milk?

111
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,960
At the beginning of our town,

112
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
I was killed by a message field.

113
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,560
It put my aid through escrevinirium.

114
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,560
In a thousand years,

115
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,960
only花 are veinsальный.

116
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,640
It will payments out to the thinning through theat seslerioriium.

117
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,640
But now, wood is走 streind what like treadity.

118
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
I think,

119
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I think only the spirit of the flower is the bloodline

120
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
can re-create the sword.

121
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,560
It's okay. I'll save you.

122
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Don't waste your energy, Master.

123
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
This is the choice of the Heaven Fire.

124
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I can save you.

125
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Master, it's useless.

126
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
It's useless. I can save you.

127
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Heaven Fire has its own destiny.

128
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,560
I've always wanted to be a king and a queen.

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
But I didn't have a moment.

130
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,560
But I've been responsible for the sword.

131
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,560
This time, I finally...

132
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,560
I finally made the most right decision.

133
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Uncle Bai, he went to the Cold Spring Palace.

134
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
He didn't let me tell you.

135
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,560
But I know if he really had any accident,

136
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,560
he would be the master forever.

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Master, this road is too simple.

138
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,560
He's gone so many people.

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Take the world to save him.

140
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Don't leave any regrets.

141
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,560
They must be given to the Hall of the Palace.

142
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Don't be sad.

143
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Heaven Fire is only looking for them.

144
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
In this life,

145
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Heaven Fire can only be controlled.

146
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
This life,

147
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
there's no regret.

148
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,560
I can't open my eyes.

149
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm afraid that the autumn wind will turn my thoughts.

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,560
It's already a little bit.

151
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,560
That year, that year,

152
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,560
the rain and the sky are falling.

153
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm like a map, hiding my thoughts.

154
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
The light of life.

155
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,560
There's a year.

156
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
There's a year.

157
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,560
The world is in the middle of the world.

158
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,560
We should wake up.

159
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Half of the fortune

160
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,560
has been waiting for 60,000 years.

161
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I'm not sure if I can make it.

162
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm afraid that I'll be lost.

163
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Half of the fortune has been waiting for 60,000 years.

164
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Zi Yue, you've been trying to get over it for five years.

165
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Why did you get the power of Zi Yue?

166
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Because I've re-entered the magical aura with Fan Yue.

167
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I can naturally meet the other person.

168
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Fan Yue, forgive me for leaving alone.

169
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,560
But before I leave, I need to do something like you.

170
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
You'll support me, won't you?

171
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,560
You should know that you're just a mortal.

172
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
You're not a god.

173
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
You've been resting for a while.

174
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Now you're strong and have a demon power.

175
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Even if no one can get the demon power,

176
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,560
from now on, you'll be tortured by the evil spirit.

177
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,560
You killed me for those buildings.

178
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
You killed yourself.

179
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
You killed yourself.

180
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
You killed yourself.

181
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
You killed yourself.

182
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
You killed yourself to kill me.

183
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
You turned yourself into a demon.

184
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Is that worth it?

185
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm not Xing Yuan.

186
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
I've never thought of doing a god.

187
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm not like him.

188
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I've been living in the world for my whole life.

189
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I never thought of it.

190
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I just protect and protect what I love.

191
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
But now I love the one I love.

192
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
I'll kill you, because of you.

193
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Even if I live a peaceful life, what's the point?

194
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I'll let you know that the love you think is fake.

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I'm the strongest in the world.

196
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
I'll kill all the people around me.

197
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
I'll give you all my heart.

198
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
But why?

199
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,560
For 60,000 years,

200
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,560
you've always been so weak and weak to me.

201
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
You've never been sincere.

202
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Love is not only for the good.

203
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Love is sacrifice.

204
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
It's a sacrifice.

205
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
But all you do is kill and kill.

206
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,560
All you do is to satisfy your own desires.

207
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Mo Li, you're not sincere at all.

208
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
You don't know how to love.

209
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,560
I'll die with you and Ying Qing.

210
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Even if I die, it's worth it.

211
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
So this is the end.

212
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
We've been through a lot.

213
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Let GMR try.

214
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Fen Yuan.

215
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
upgrades

216
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
These are indigenous

217
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,440
The gods have restarted their Hell

218
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
How do they find one when Xing Yue?

219
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,400
As what you said

220
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,520
Yang Fulin is the gongling's superior

221
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
He died.

222
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
The God Palace is in danger.

223
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,560
No wonder he can hurt me.

224
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Heavens, you're so lucky.

225
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
You let the God Palace have a good reputation.

226
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Heaven thought that this kind of foundation could stop me.

227
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm so worried.

228
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,560
You said that I don't understand love and I should kill.

229
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Today, I'll let you see

230
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,560
the so-called true love and sacrifice.

231
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
How stupid!

232
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
How could it be?

233
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,560
60,000 years ago, I was in the God Palace with the Moon of the Moon.

234
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
You thought that 60,000 years later,

235
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
I would still be the only one who could threaten me.

236
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
There was no way.

237
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
I was even more powerful than you.

238
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
But you're just a mortal.

239
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
I'll come to the God Palace with the Moon of the Moon

240
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
and hurt you again.

241
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Chong Zhao, what are you doing?

242
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Chong Zhao,

243
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
you can stop me from going to the Night Sea?

244
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Uncle, Fan Yu!

245
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
It's Uncle.

246
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Uncle, wake up!

247
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
You always want to be a prince.

248
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
You forgot that there's a saving in the world.

249
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
You're a prince.

250
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
You're a prince.

251
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
You're a prince.

252
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
You're a prince.

253
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
You're a prince.

254
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
You're a prince.

255
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
You forgot that there's a saying in the world,

256
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
that if you're convinced, you'll be rewarded.

257
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
You're a prince.

258
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
I can't kill you, nor can I go out to the Night Sea.

259
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,560
But I'm so lucky that I can still wait for you.

260
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Chong Zhao, what are you trying to do?

261
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Uncle, I've lived until now

262
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
because that was Ah Xi's honor.

263
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I also wanted to get back to the body and get to know him.

264
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I know that my death can only cause me to be in trouble.

265
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
I can't kill him.

266
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
So, Ah Xi has been waiting for me.

267
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I can give him a chance to prove his innocence.

268
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I've waited for this.

269
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,560
I'll die for what I've done.

270
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Uncle, Fan Yu.

271
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Don't be soft-hearted.

272
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Remember,

273
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
kill Mo Li,

274
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
and save the world.

275
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
I'll take a break.

276
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
I'll find a way to get back to the world.

277
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I'll take the sky and face the world.

278
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I'll take all the things that I've done.

279
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll spend all my life with you.

280
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Ah Zhao!

281
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
I'll never ask you for anything.

282
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I'll be with you forever.

283
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I've missed so many things.

284
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I'll be with you forever.

285
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Even if I blow your eyes,

286
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I can still kiss your face.

287
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I'll find my destiny.

288
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I'll change my life into a human's life.

289
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
I won't...

290
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Ah Zhao.

291
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I'll find my destiny.

292
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Mo Li, you've lost.

293
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
The world is at its peak.

294
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,560
You can finally defeat your evil.

295
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Do you think I'll die so easily?

296
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,560
I couldn't even use the stars and the jade to destroy my shadow.

297
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Do you think you can?

298
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Now I'm stronger.

299
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I'll be dead if I fight back.

300
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
This distance will be shattered.

301
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,560
I'll use the power of the world

302
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
to fight back.

303
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,560
I'll be dead if I fight back.

304
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
I'll be dead if I fight back.

305
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I'll be dead if I fight back.

306
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I'll be dead if I fight back.

307
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
You're dead.

308
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
You're dead.

309
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Mo Li!

310
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
You're dead.

311
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
You can't kill me.

312
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
You're dead.

313
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
You can't do anything.

314
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
You're dead.

315
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Fengyu, what are you doing?

316
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Stop!

317
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Ah Zhao, do you still remember

318
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,560
what you promised me on Mount Ji?

319
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
I'll take good care of you, Yuan Tian.

320
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I'll stay with the fire.

321
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I'll go to see the beautiful mountains and rivers on the road.

322
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I'll keep every star and moon.

323
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I promise you.

324
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,560
You said that I won't stay alone.

325
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Six thousand years ago,

326
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
I let him die today.

327
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I'll leave him to the past.

328
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Fengyu, you can't fool me.

329
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Stop, Ah Zhao.

330
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Let's kill each other before the real moon.

331
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
You want me to die with you?

332
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,560
I'm a god of demons and a living god.

333
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I'm willing to die for the sake of my life.

334
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
It's for you.

335
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,560
For the sake of this life that's living every day.

336
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I don't know what to do.

337
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
But I know that this is what I should do to the king.

338
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,560
There's a flying flower in the sky.

339
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
The stars are in the sky.

340
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
The East is the answer.

341
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,560
You know that this is the only way.

342
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I promise you.

343
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Everything has been changed.

344
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I owe you my life.

345
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:01,560
But I'm not sure how to express my feelings.

346
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,560
When you put love in my heart.

347
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,560
When my heart is only for you.

348
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
When the sky is low.

349
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,560
I can still see the moon.

350
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,560
When my heart is lonely.

351
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm willing to die for the sake of my life.

352
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
It's for you.

353
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
The world is big.

354
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
The sky is dark.

355
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Promise me.

356
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
No matter what happens in the future.

357
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Just like now.

358
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Keep going.

359
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,560
The owner is always in trouble.

360
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
He's a good man.

361
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
He's the best.

362
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
He's always on the road.

363
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,560
He's always with me.

364
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Life is from nothing.

365
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
To nothing.

366
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
I like freedom.

367
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Now I'm free.

368
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm Chen Xi.

369
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
You're Xin Yue.

370
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
You're the star.

371
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
You're the star.

372
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
You must be forever.

373
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Forever.

374
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,560
A long-awaited loser.

375
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
God.

376
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Go find them.

377
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
This life.

378
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,560
God can follow the owner.

379
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I will never...

380
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Listen to me.

381
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
My son.

382
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Six thousand years.

383
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
My son.

384
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Too many people died.

385
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,560
I'll give them a chance to die.

386
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't waste their time.

387
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Do it.

388
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
spine

389
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
no

390
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
water

391
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
rows

392
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I wish

393
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
I know.

394
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,560
How can you be so determined to do this to me?

395
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
I know Uncle Ah.

396
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
He is the most brave man in the world.

397
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
He is a good man.

398
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
He will always be good to me.

399
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I know.

400
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
You are the one who is going to die.

401
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Uncle Ah.

402
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Uncle Ah.

403
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Uncle Ah.

404
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Uncle Ah.

405
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Uncle Ah.

406
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I will always be here.

407
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I will be a star.

408
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I will be a sun.

409
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I will pass through your side.

410
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Every journey.

411
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
I will always be with you.

412
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I will be with you.

413
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I will always be with you.

414
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I will always be with you.

415
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
I will always be with you.

416
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Uncle Ah.

417
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I love you.

418
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
I love you.

419
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I used to think that

420
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Jinglei was impulsive.

421
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
She was always making trouble around her.

422
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Now that she is gone,

423
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
I feel a little cold.

424
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
I am a little bit used to it.

425
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Aren't you still me?

426
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I used to have Jinglei.

427
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I didn't have time to do that.

428
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
As long as you like it,

429
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I can be with you all day.

430
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
I will always be with you.

431
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I will always be with you.

432
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I will always be with you.

433
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I will always be with you.

434
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
You are now the two leaders

435
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
of Lanling.

436
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
You are always talking nonsense.

437
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Why are you talking nonsense?

438
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Not at all.

439
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Not at all.

440
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Lanling will never have the same opinion.

441
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
In the future,

442
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
we will be together

443
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
to protect the world.

444
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
That's right.

445
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
The ancestors' loyalty is in the power.

446
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
It's not in the power of the devil.

447
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
The ancestors' loyalty is in the power of the devil.

448
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
It's a pity that

449
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Chongzhao will never come back.

450
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Maybe the world is like this.

451
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
It's hard to be full of it.

452
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
The chaos of the Yin-Zun is

453
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
all over the place.

454
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
In fact, no matter who is the fairy,

455
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
the demon,

456
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
the human or the artist,

457
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
as long as there is a heart

458
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
to protect the world,

459
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
it is the same path.

460
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,560
It's time to be the one who will protect Lanling.

461
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
But let me tell you.

462
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
The one who should protect her

463
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
is Bai Shuo.

464
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
In the past 60,000 years,

465
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
no one can imagine

466
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
that a mortal can become a god.

467
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
The so-called god

468
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
is not about the power of the devil,

469
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
nor the bloodline of the devil.

470
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
It's about

471
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
the love of the heart.

472
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Although Bai Shuo has become the star of the moon,

473
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
he has not become the goddess of the heart.

474
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Instead, he has become the god of Bai Shuo

475
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
with the power of the devil.

476
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
He has taken a path

477
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
that belongs to him.

478
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Old man,

479
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm here to see you.

480
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Fifty years ago,

481
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I took the wine from the Buji House.

482
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Let's try it together.

483
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Father,

484
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
I miss you.

485
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Good wine.

486
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Little rabbit,

487
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
I'll drink with you.

488
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Old rabbit.

489
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm here.

490
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I found Xun.

491
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Xun,

492
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
I found Xun.

493
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Xun,

494
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
I found Xun.

495
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I found Xun.

496
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I know.

497
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
But I can't protect him.

498
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
That's Xier's choice.

499
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
It's none of your business.

500
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Oh, right.

501
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
You've been away for so long.

502
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
How is it?

503
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
You can become a god?

504
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Do you still remember this?

505
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
I...

506
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I can't bear to do it.

507
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
I can't bear to do it anymore.

508
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
You can't bear to do it.

509
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
You can't do anything.

510
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
You can be a happy man.

511
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Isn't that good?

512
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Old rabbit,

513
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I've been so close to you.

514
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
I saw you.

515
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
I've loved people

516
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
and people who have been loved.

517
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
But now they're not here.

518
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
I've been to the place

519
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
where the world is.

520
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
The world is the strongest.

521
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
But the price is too high.

522
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
If I were to choose,

523
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
I'd rather not have left

524
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
the small city of Nian.

525
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I'd rather not be a loser.

526
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,560
You've seen everything I've experienced.

527
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Girl,

528
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
you've done a great job.

529
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,560
You should believe that those who were with you

530
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
have already left.

531
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
But they'll always stay in your heart.

532
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Just like father,

533
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
no matter how far I've gone,

534
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
I'll be with you

535
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
no matter when or where.

536
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Old rabbit,

538
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
don't worry.

539
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,560
I'll walk this way.

540
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Did you get it?

541
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
You're so sincere today.

542
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
You're so kind.

543
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I can tell you

544
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
with all my heart.

545
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Who is the real person

546
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
of the person who's been married?

547
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Master Sun.

548
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
You're not a mortal.

549
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
I can't even see your power.

550
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Who are you?

551
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Who am I?

552
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
You were in the sea

553
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
60,000 years ago.

554
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Didn't you ask me?

555
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
I'm not a mortal.

556
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm a human being.

557
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
I'm a human being.

558
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
I'm a human being.

559
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I'm a human being.

560
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
You're not a mortal.

561
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Didn't you ask me?

562
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
You're...

563
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I'm not a mortal.

564
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm not a mortal either.

565
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
I've had many names.

566
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
But maybe

567
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
the most familiar name is

568
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Tian Dao.

569
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
When I was living in Ni'en City,

570
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
you knew who I was?

571
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Yes.

572
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
I knew that Yin Zun

573
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
would be in the world again.

574
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
And I knew that you had the Star Moon Pavilion.

575
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
So I told you

576
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
to meet me here again.

577
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Since you've been here,

578
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
why didn't you kill Mo Li?

579
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Why did you

580
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,560
watch so many sacrifice and leave the world?

581
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Tian Dao is the chief of the world.

582
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
He can't enter the world directly.

583
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Even if I know

584
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Mo Li's evil,

585
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
I can't kill him completely.

586
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
So I changed my mind

587
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
to protect the world.

588
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
And you finally did it.

589
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
To be honest,

590
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
you didn't become the Star Moon.

591
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
But you became the only one

592
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
in the world

593
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
with the human body.

594
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
You proved

595
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
that you're the only one

596
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
in the world

597
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
for ten million years.

598
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
Tian Dao

599
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
will also be wrong.

600
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
I used to think

601
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
that if you love the Star Moon,

602
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
you can make it stronger

603
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
and stop the disaster.

604
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
But you failed.

605
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
Now I see

606
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
a stronger power on you.

607
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
This power is love,

608
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,560
sacrifice, and protection.

609
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
You're telling me now

610
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
that Tian Dao is wrong.

611
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
What's the point?

612
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
You can let everything

613
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
happen

614
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
or you can return

615
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
the people who left Wu Gu?

616
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Give me.

617
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
The world is a country with good and evil.

618
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
To love and die is to live.

619
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Those who died for the great will

620
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
will return

621
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
in another way.

622
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Just like Tian Dao

623
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
is a threat to the world.

624
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,560
The Itís-the-M es-Est

625
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Remember,

626
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,180
OMG will be caresuness

627
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,680
if you protect him more.

628
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,480
May the real enterprises of this world

629
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,080
chlorine all access,

630
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,660
take hold of all又世 men

631
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,660
and reminder life

632
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,840
Three

633
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,940
What

634
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,860
More

635
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,880
Mynee

636
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,980
Not

637
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,460
More

638
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,320
It's the bringing of

639
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,060
Having this

640
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,740
My mom...

641
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,540
My sister…

642
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,180
My sister...

643
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,740
I came back for the fallen tree.

644
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm afraid of the one I love.

645
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,740
My heart will only be yours.

646
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,740
These days, I've been to many places.

647
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,740
I went to see the things you've said.

648
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,740
The sun and the stars. The clouds and the sun.

649
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,740
I saw everything as your mirror.

650
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,740
You were always by my side.

651
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
But you always came with the wind.

652
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,740
You always came with the wind.

653
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,740
I know that the stars are not real.

654
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,740
This time, you are real.

655
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,740
Uncle Ma, this time I will use my life to return to you.

656
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,740
I will return to you.

657
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,740
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

658
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,740
It's not the wind. It's the star.

659
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,740
When you put the answer in my heart.

660
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,740
When my heart only looks at you.

661
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,740
When the road is narrow.

662
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,740
I can still meet you.

663
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,740
When my eyes are blind.

664
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,740
I only see you in the stars.

665
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,740
When you make the promise of the shooting star.

666
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,740
Fengyu, thank you for coming back.

667
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,740
Thank you for business.

668
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
YDon...

669
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,740
Zee was going here just now?

670
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,740
But she really came to visit you.

671
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,740
She is far away from home.

672
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:46,740
I'm so excited

673
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,740
Wait for me

674
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,740
I'm so happy to see you

675
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,740
You are the light I want to see

676
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,740
It's a lonely journey

677
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,740
Let this moment be with you

678
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:20,740
I want to be with you

679
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:27,740
I'm so excited

680
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,740
You are the blue earth in my life

681
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,740
Let the rain and the wind

682
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Let the tears stop

683
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:52,740
Let this life be with you

684
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:07,740
I want to be with you
