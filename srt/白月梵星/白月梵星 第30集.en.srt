1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 30]

19
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,690
I was just following the sound.

20
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,850
I didn't mean to disturb you.

21
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,170
No worries.

22
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,450
Tonight’s moon and stars are reminiscent of the ones

23
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,960
I saw back in the Divine Region.

24
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,190
It reminds me of

25
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,980
people and events from

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,060
a long time ago.

27
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,210
I...

28
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,579
You don't have to feel guilty.

29
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,240
I harbor no other intentions.

30
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,770
It's just that seeing you these past two days

31
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,230
made me think of old friends who have passed.

32
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,520
Fan Yue?

33
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,620
Where could he have gone

34
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,970
at this hour?

35
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,710
We entered Bodhi Village by accident

36
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,460
because we were looking for Old Turtle.

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,220
Now that Old Turtle has been found,

38
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,650
it's time for us to leave.

39
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,110
Tomorrow morning,

40
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,410
Bai Shuo and I will return to Bright Moon Palace.

41
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,790
What's the rush?

42
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,769
Master Fan,

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,350
can't you stay for a few more days?

44
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,750
You should understand that

45
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,680
I already have someone in my heart.

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,800
While I do feel guilty towards you,

47
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,660
that's as far as it goes.

48
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,470
Yes.

49
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,220
You are not him after all.

50
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,530
But you two have the exact same eyebrows.

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,850
Ms. Bai?

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
Shuo.

53
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,150
We met by chance,

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,800
not on purpose.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,270
Please don’t take it to heart.

56
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,790
You don't need to keep explaining on behalf of Fan Yue.

57
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,320
We've been through life and death,

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,180
so of course I'll trust him fully.

59
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,730
You and Master Fan are in perfect harmony with each other.

60
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,050
I envy you.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,310
It's late.

62
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,630
I'll get going.

63
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,120
Divine Maiden.

64
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,360
It has been so many years.

65
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,610
If the Demon Lord is destined to never return,

66
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,780
have you ever thought about leaving Bodhi Village

67
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,980
and see the Eastern Continent of today,

68
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,940
which you had protected back then?

69
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
I've done what I set out to do

70
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,940
60,000 years ago.

71
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,350
Since Jing Yuan no longer exists in this world,

72
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,350
there's no need for Xing Yue to exist either.

73
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,710
Now I just want to protect this quiet place

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
and reminisce the past.

75
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,900
Perhaps in my heart,

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,320
I'll always believe that

77
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,060
as long as I don't forget him,

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,990
he will live on in my heart forever.

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,159
Do you feel sorry for her?

80
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,130
No.

81
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,110
I know.

82
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,850
We've been through so much together.

83
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,150
I won't doubt our relationship anymore.

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Even if your body holds some of the Demon Lord's memories,

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,720
and that they may live longer than us

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,400
and are more powerful than us,

87
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,210
the relationship we share

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,190
is not any lighter or less profound

89
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,650
than any other relationships in this world.

90
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,180
I just feel that she seems really pitiful

91
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,370
and I feel sorry for her.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,150
Shuo.

93
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,040
Even a deity

94
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,980
can't have everything go as they wish.

95
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,240
Even if there's guilt,

96
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,930
I should feel guilty, not you.

97
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,100
I just want to find the last Contemplation

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,140
and remove the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on you.

99
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,700
Love, hate, kill, greed, and kindness.

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,310
Now only greed is left.

101
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,909
But there is so much greed in this world.

102
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,770
Love is a form of greed.

103
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,140
Sin is a form of greed.

104
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,740
Every want

105
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,300
or desire is a form of greed.

106
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,900
It may exist in any corner of the world

107
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,330
or in anyone's heart.

108
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,930
It's too vague.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,220
The first four Contemplations were all preceded by omens.

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,650
I believe the fifth Contemplation will definitely appear.

111
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,650
Fan Yue.

112
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,690
I am sure we will be together forever.

113
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,670
Someone actually hid this village with their spiritual power.

114
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,690
I followed the Hidden power in Chong Zhao's body to get here.

115
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,300
It seems that Chong Zhao

116
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,190
is in this village.

117
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,650
Lanling Barrier?

118
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,600
Divine power?

119
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,380
It's been 60,000 years.

120
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,840
Who would've thought

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,230
the Hidden Race still exists in this world?

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,630
Though you've done a fine job disguising yourself as a demon.

123
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,210
I also didn't expect that

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,650
the Lotus Spirit

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,590
still exists in this world.

126
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,380
If a mere beast like you from the Hidden Race can live just fine,

127
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,210
why can't I, who have basked in

128
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,230
divine rays for thousands of years?

129
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,250
Why are you here?

130
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm not sure what she's up to.

131
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,669
I mustn't let her know Chong Zhao's identity.

132
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,390
The Contemplation Stone is a sacred object of the Divine Race.

133
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,030
Now, the person with the Contemplation Stone

134
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,200
is in this village.

135
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,409
I...

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,900
came for her of course.

137
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,450
If you hand over the people who had just entered the village,

138
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,090
Considering we're both from the Divine Race,

139
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,160
I can

140
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,990
spare you this time.

141
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,350
Back when I transformed into a spirit next to the Demon Lord,

142
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,560
you haven't even gained spiritual consciousness.

143
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,880
Do you really think

144
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,850
you are my match?

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,570
On the account of our old ties from back then,

146
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,950
I'll let you off the hook today.

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,760
Don't even think about hurting any of these villagers.

148
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,870
They...

149
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,540
are all mine.

150
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,610
Get lost!

151
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,210
I have yet to fully recover.

152
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,620
I can't simply barge in.

153
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,440
Looks like

154
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,180
I'll have to start with this Lanling Barrier.

155
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,770
I have bid farewell to Luan Zhu last night.

156
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,270
There's no need to greet her again.

157
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,100
But what are your plans for

158
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,410
Fu Ling and Chong Zhao?

159
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,000
Chong Zhao just reunited with his parents.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,450
I'm sure he'll want to stay here for a few more days.

161
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,630
As for Fu Ling...

162
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,960
Ms. Bai!

163
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,020
Ms. Bai!

164
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,750
Mis. Bai, your master..

165
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,800
What happened to my master?

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Your master went out to collect herbs early in the morning

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,850
and accidentally fell off the cliff.

168
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,580
He even broke his turtle shell!

169
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,710
Master!

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,320
My disciple!

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,200
You're finally here.

172
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,030
How are you feeling?

173
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm afraid today is the last time you and I

174
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,510
will see each other.

175
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
It hurts so much!

176
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,080
Don't talk nonsense.

177
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,480
Your turtle shell is so badly cracked.

178
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,150
Where is your medicine?

179
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,350
I'll apply it for you.

180
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,360
We are not at Lanling,

181
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,270
so I have no medicine.

182
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,910
That's also why I went up the mountain to collect herbs,

183
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,170
only to fall off from the cliff.

184
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Fan Yue.

185
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,210
Please take care of Master for me.

186
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go up the mountain to collect herbs.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,910
I'll go with you.

188
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,670
No, no!

189
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,200
You mustn't leave me all alone.

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,320
At least one of you

191
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,260
should stay behind with me.

192
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,930
What if some bad guys come in?

193
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,240
There's nothing I can do now.

194
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,870
You don't know anything about medicine,

195
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,750
so I should go.

196
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,750
You stay and take care of Master.

197
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,540
But you...

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,230
I'll be right back!

199
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Be careful, Shuo!

200
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,480
Be careful, Shuo!

201
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,840
Thank goodness I have you, Xi.

202
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't be afraid.

203
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,280
As long as I'm here,

204
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,700
no matter what happens,

205
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,570
I'll be at your side in no time

206
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,520
and protect you.

207

209

♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

211
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,090
is commonly seen in the Eternal and Demon Races.

212
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,750
With just a moment of inattention,

213
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,600
you'll be eaten alive

214
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,310
once you get caught.

215
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,430
If you've nothing better to do, can you stop running around?

216
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,000

Why did you save me?

219
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,850
I remember you asked me

220
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,550
about this dagger back in the Fox Clan.

221
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,470
♫Across thousands of miles♫

222

♫The pain of parting lingers♫

224

This dagger

225
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,670
was a gift from my sister, Bai Xi.

226

♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

has nothing to do with me.

229
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,720
Xi said

230
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,860

♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

232
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,410
she would be by my side immediately.

233
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,090
She also said

234
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,600
as long as she's by my side,

235
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,850
I don't have to be afraid.

So what?

238
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,780
I've told you that Bai Xi is dead,

239
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,790
but you refuse to believe me.

240
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,390
Then why did you show up?

241
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,810
Why did you save me?

♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

you would've wanted me dead.

245
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,580
I was just passing by,

246
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,830
and now I’m being questioned on my occasional kindness.

247

264
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,420
I don't have much days left to live.

265
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,930
Even if we acknowledge each other,

266
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,760
so what?

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,170
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

268

How is Master?

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
He's fine for now.

270
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,820
He just fell asleep.

271
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,150
What's wrong?

272
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,340
You look troubled.

273
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,900
When I was gathering herbs in the mountain just now,

274
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,540
I happened to encounter a carnivorous flower.

275
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,970
Carnivorous flower?

276
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,160
Are you hurt?

277
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm fine. Don't worry.

278
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,160
It was...

279
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,970
Fu Ling who appeared in time

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,170
and saved me.

281
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,440
Fu Ling?

282
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,210
If she wasn't Xi,

283
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,170
why would she risk her life to save me?

284
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,300
But she refuses to admit that she is Xi.

285
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,300
There are too many things

286
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,310
standing between the both of you.

287
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,890
If I were her,

288
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,770
perhaps I wouldn't dare to acknowledge you either.

289
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,160
Give her some time,

290
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,400
and also give yourself some time too.

291
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll go make medicine for Master first.

292
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,790
If I had known it was so dangerous,

293
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,080
I wouldn't have let you go up the mountain to collect herbs.

294
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,410
Isn't Fu Ling your rival?

295
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,910
Why did she save you?

296
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,520
Could it be that...

297
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,830
she found her conscience and wants to turn over a new leaf?

298
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,690
My disciple,

299
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,900
what's wrong?

300
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,140
Master.

301
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,270
People often say that

302
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,860
there is no greater virtue than recognizing one's mistakes and making amends.

303
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,030
But if someone

304
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,750
made a really huge mistake,

305
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,710
can they still turn things around?

306
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,510
You keep asking me such tough questions.

307
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,530
I don't know who you're talking about,

308
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,350
but I think

309
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,320
in this world,

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,850
not everyone have choices.

311
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Also, not everyone can

312
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,630
live according to their wishes.

313
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,750
Perhaps,

314
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,960
even the most despicable people have a pitiable side.

315
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,480
My disciple,

316
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,890
why are you suddenly asking such a question?

317
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,800
Did Fan Yue bully you?

318
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,880
No.

319
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,880
It's Xi.

320
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
Bai Xi?

321
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,850
Your... your sister?

322
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,610
Remember,

323
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,320
don't mess with the wrong people.

324
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,520
With you protecting Shuo,

325
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,270
no one will bully her anymore.

326
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,099
Why are you here?

327
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,460
For the same reasons as you.

328
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,859
I'm here to investigate.

329
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,849
You also have your suspicions?

330
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,980
There's a record of this village

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,060
in my parents' handwritten journal.

332
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,109
I was curious how this village

333
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,400
could have disappeared so quickly in front of my parents,

334
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,150
yet somehow, they were able to enter

335
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,810
and remain hidden here for 10 years afterwards.

336
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,260
So do you trust this journal more,

337
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,720
or do you trust them as they are now?

338
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,190
I don't know.

339
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm even a little afraid to face the truth.

340
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,400
Regardless which is real or fake,

341
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,000
neither of it is a good outcome for me.

342
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,940
You mean Fu Ling may be your sister?

343
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,670
But I don't understand.

344
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,280
If she were Xi,

345
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,510
how could she have done that

346
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,850
to our father?

347
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,590
Unless

348
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,450
she didn't know she's Xi herself.

349
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Do you want to confirm the real identity of Fu Ling?

350
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,330
Do you have a way?

351
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
Although I don't,

352
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,060
the Divine Maiden does.

353
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,050
The Spirit Conjuration Cauldron?

354
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,370
I heard from Master that you have this instrument

355
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,300
that can verify kinship through a drop of blood.

356
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,830
You want to verify kinship?

357
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,890
I've got my own use for it.

358
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,700
If you are willing to lend me this treasure of yours,

359
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,290
I will definitely repay you.

360
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,010
How will you repay me?

361
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,320
What do you want?

362
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,570
I will give you anything

363
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,700
within my means.

364
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,460
Since you are Fan Yue's lover,

365
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,350
then you're also my friend.

366
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,140
If you're my friend,

367
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,560
how could I be stingy?

368
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,540
This is the Spirit Conjuration Cauldron you are looking for.

369
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,970
Simply drip your blood into the cauldron,

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and it will reveal

371
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,790
your closest kin connected to you by blood.

372
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,810
Thank you, Divine Maiden.

373
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,640
I owe you a big favor today.

374
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,820
That's not necessary.

375
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,480
I hope you get the results you are hoping for.

376
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,140
Come out.

377
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,030
Congratulations, Divine Maiden.

378
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,720
Your wish will come true soon.

379
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,860
Looks like your cracked shell was worth it.

380
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,870
For you, Divine Maiden,

381
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,060
my injury...

382
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,970
is nothing.

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,370
But there's something

384
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,630
I'm curious about.

385
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,490
Why don't you just kill her?

386
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,940
If I kill her,

387
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,830
Fan Yue will remember her forever.

388
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,590
Why should I bother myself?

389
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,460
By the way,

390
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,290
how is that old man?

391
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,640
That old bastard

392
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
is half dead by now.

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,770
Once he's completely dead,

394
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,320
you'll have him all to yourself.

395
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,590
Whether it's his body, appearance,

396
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,110
lifespan, destiny,

397
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,610
or his alchemy and divination skills.

398
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you for blessing me, Divine Maiden.

399
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,940
For so many years,

400
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,920
I only managed to maintain human form

401
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,090
by absorbing the Eternals' spiritual energy.

402
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,770
I'm tired of it.

403
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,960
This time,

404
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,840
I might as well find a way to solve it once and for all.

405
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,440
But Divine Maiden,

406
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,450
there’s still one more thing that I don’t understand.

407
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,120
Although you and the Demon Lord

408
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,360
were deeply in love,

409
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,660
that was 60,000 years ago.

410
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,640
The Demon Lord is no longer the Demon Lord from back then

411
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,710
because Fan Yue has forgotten everything.

412
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,160
Why do you...

413
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,550
Why do you have to stay so obsessed with him?

414
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,180
You're just a dummy made of silk.

415
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,540
What would you know?

416
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,700
He gave me life with his divine blood.

417
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,600
His blood

418
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,070
runs through my veins.

419
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,860
Even after 60,000 years,

420
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,930
even if he has forgotten everything,

421
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,790
as long as I'm alive,

422
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,570
every moment,

423
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
this beating pulse,

424
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,150
this flowing blood,

425
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,150
this unbroken breath

426
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,280
all remind me that

427
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,180
I exist because of him.

428
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,470
And he...

429
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,880
can only...

430
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,820
and must only be mine.

431
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,510
Fu Ling.

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,150
Are you really Xi?

433
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,360
I have too many questions.

434
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,060
If you are Xi,

435
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,300
why did you transform into a demon from a human?

436
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,560
And why did you force our father to death?

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,070
Now,

438
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,790
I want a clear answer.

439
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,390
It's you.

440
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,510
What did you do to me?

441
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,000
You pricked yourself.

442
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,590
What can I do?

443
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,050
What is this?

444
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,190
I came to tell you that

445
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,010
I remembered it wrong.

446
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,860
This Spirit Conjuration Cauldron is not meant for you to confirm your kinship,

447
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,040
but it's meant for me

448
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,100
to take your body.

449
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,530
What do you mean?

450
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,590
Don't fret.

451
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,360
You'll know soon.

452
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,070
Don't waste your breath.

453
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,790
Your blood is in the cauldron.

454
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,300
Your body has been controlled.

455
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,910
So,

456
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,300
you've been pretending this entire time.

457
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,640
That's right.

458
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,530
Since you entered Bodhi Village,

459
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,770
I've been scheming.

460
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,830
Do you know why

461
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,610
you were attacked by the carnivorous flower

462
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,090
and Fu Ling came coincidentally to save you?

463
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,160
I know you've been guessing

464
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,830
if Fu Ling is your sister or not.

465
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,390
She doesn't admit it,

466
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,010
but she's always watching you.

467
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,640
So, I gave her a push

468
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,680
to see if she'd save you.

469
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,920
As expected,

470
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,510
she saved you.

471
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,710
In this way,

472
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,330
you want to know her identity even more, right?

473
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,170
You guided me step by step

474
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,230
to finally borrow the Spirit Conjuration Cauldron from you.

475
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,500
No.

476
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,570
Master asked me to borrow the treasure from the Divine Maiden.

477
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,030
He is not my master.

478
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,070
You're so smart.

479
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,940
Unfortunately, it's too late.

480
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,800
The one you've been calling "Master" these days

481
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,170
is just a fake person

482
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,910
I made with silk.

483
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,710
Where is my real master?

484
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,270
He's also in Bodhi Village.

485
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,460
Don't worry.

486
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,140
You'll see him in the future.

487
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,700
Now,

488
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,040
let's settle our problem first.

489
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,100
This body is mine.

490
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,120
Fan Yue

491
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,040
will be mine in the end too.

492
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Strange.

493
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,270
Why is the mountain so foggy?

494
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,730
The fog can't be erased even with spiritual power.

495
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,900
It seems that it's not an ordinary barrier.

496
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,060
This is the only way in and out of Bodhi Village.

497
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,960
If the fog is still there,

498
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,690
we won't be able to find the way out of the village.

499
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,720
Let's go further.

500
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
Fan Yue.

501
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,000
Chong Zhao.

502
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,920
Aren't you taking care of Old Turtle?

503
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Why are you here?

504
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,790
Master has taken the medicine.

505
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,240
He's fine now.

506
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,830
I found you were missing.

507
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,820
I was afraid you were not safe,

508
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,010
so I came out to find you.

509
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,360
What are you doing here?

510
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,430
We think this village is strange.

511
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,570
It's shrouded in fog.

512
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,970
It seems we can't get out.

513
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,270
All of this fog

514
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,720
won't disperse so quickly.

515
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
It's late now.

516
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,510
It's more dangerous at night in the mountain.

517
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,440
Why don't we go back first

518
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,620
and wait till tomorrow?

519
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,450
Okay.

520
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,230
Let's go.

521
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,890
Why did you suddenly go to the back mountain?

522
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,470
That carnivorous flower dared to attack you.

523
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,270
Of course I have to take revenge.

524
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,560
The carnivorous flower is cruel.

525
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,890
I don't want you to get hurt because of me.

526
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,570
What's wrong?

527
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,450
Nothing.

528
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,460
I thought you would say I made a fuss.

529
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,620
As a Demon King, I want to seek revenge on a flower.

530
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,410
Are you unhappy

531
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,710
I care about you?

532
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,610
That's not what I meant.

533
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,250
Sit down.

534
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,400
I just feel

535
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,430
everything in this village is strange.

536
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,190
That's why I wanted to find out.

537
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,510
Chong Zhao's parents disappeared for 10 years

538
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,110
and suddenly appeared here.

539
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,530
Old Turtle fled here

540
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
and fell off the cliff for no reason.

541
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,320
The carnivorous flower suddenly attacked you.

542
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,600
Now there's fog surrounding the village.

543
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,810
All of these matters

544
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,350
seem to be unrelated,

545
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,480
but I think there must be something behind it.

546
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,750
It's like...

547
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,170
Like someone

548
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,600
is trying to keep us here.

549
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,400
Who do you think it is?

550
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,640
If someone deliberately set up

551
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,310
the fog surrounding the village

552
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,430
and I can't dispel it even with my demonic power,

553
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,720
then only one person in Bodhi Village

554
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,960
could've done it.

555
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,420
I'll go talk to her.

556
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,300
It's getting dark.

557
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,150
I'll be back soon.

558
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,500
What did you find?

559
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,410
There's heavy fog in the mountain.

560
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,990
We can't find the way out of the village anymore.

561
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,850
It's like a maze set up on purpose.

562
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,860
Fog.

563
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,610
Did you find anything else?

564
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,680
Are you still

565
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,710
suspicious of your parents?

566
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,960
You haven't seen each other for 10 years.

567
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,420
It's normal that there's a feeling

568
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,500
of estrangement.

569
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,900
We've been apart for too long.

570
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,070
I should cherish every moment of reunion,

571
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,770
but I don't feel natural intimacy

572
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,610
from my heart toward them.

573
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,590
Do you think it's my problem

574
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,510
or theirs?

575
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,070
Zhao,

576
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,870
Ms. Fu Ling.

577
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,470
Come in and eat.

578
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,510
Coming.

579
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,330
Here,

580
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,000
Ms. Fu Ling.

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,680
Thank you.

582
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,990
Eat, Zhao.

583
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,710
Zhao,

584
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,840
why aren't you eating?

585
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
Do you not like my cooking?

586
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,580
No.

587
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,060
I found heavy fog in the mountain

588
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,780
and it blocked the way out of the village.

589
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,480
Do you know what this is?

590
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,010
Heavy fog?

591
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,010
Maybe it's because of the bad weather.

592
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,430
Why? Are you leaving?

593
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,120
Chong Zhao just reunited with you.

594
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,600
How could he bear to leave?

595
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,190
That's good.

596
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
That's good.

597
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,350
-Let’s eat.
-Let’s eat.

598
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,630
Do you really want us to stay?

599
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,810
What are you talking about?

600
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,680
Your mother and I haven't seen you for 10 years.

601
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,820
Now we finally meet again.

602
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,760
Of course we hope to spend more time with you.

603
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,410
Why don't we go together?

604
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,380
Going back to Lanling or Ning'an City,

605
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,460
you can still hide your identity

606
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,920
and live an ordinary life.

607
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,610
Zhao,

608
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
your father and I have lived here for 10 years.

609
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,940
We're used to it.

610
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,990
We don't want the trouble anymore.

611
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,200
You were in Lanling for 100 years,

612
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,390
but you could give it up easily.

613
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,590
You've only lived here for 10 years.

614
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,310
Why...

615
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,510
What can't you let go?

616
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,650
Or are you afraid of something?

617
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,150
Mother,

618
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,200
you met Bai Xi when you were

619
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,240
running away back then, right?

620
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,830
Why did you ask her to tell me

621
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,680
not to go back to Lanling?

622
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,400
Who is after you?

623
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,410
Which sect? Which group? Who?

624
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,830
You won't forget the enemy that

625
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,910
wanted to kill you, right?

626
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,910
Father.

627
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,240
You and Master were close.

628
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400
Does Master know you're hiding in

629
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,390
Bodhi Village?

630
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Chong Zhao.

631
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,450
So what do you mean?

632
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,580
Do you know what you're doing?

633
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,260
You're interrogating your parents.

634
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,640
You're doubting your Master.

635
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,220
I just want to know the truth.

636
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,540
How did your mother and I teach you?

637
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,890
It's only been 10 years.

638
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,710
Have you forgotten the most basic filial piety?

639
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,070
I'm so angry.

640
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,740
Why are you mad at him?

641
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,120
Enough.

642
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,300
Stop pretending.

643
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,720
He's already suspicious.

644
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,590
What should we do now?

645
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,960
Don't be nervous. The Divine Maiden said

646
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,270
it's normal for them to be suspicious.

647
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,750
As long as she's not angry,

648
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,170
everything will be fine.

649
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,790
I hope the Divine Maiden can get what she wants soon.

650
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,210
Only when she is happy

651
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,020
can our lives be easier.

652
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,690
I know you have a lot of doubts,

653
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,110
but you were too emotional just now.

654
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,550
I didn't want to get emotional,

655
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,550
but I couldn't help it.

656
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,460
I wish everything can go back to how it was.

657
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,680
But why is it the more I ask, the more wrong it feels?

658
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,960
My father used to teach me

659
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,430
to persuade people with reason,

660
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,300
instead of volume and status.

661
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,190
But he threatened me with filial piety just now.

662
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,220
He's trying to avoid things.

663
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,590
Maybe there's a natural instinct when facing one's family.

664
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,610
I think

665
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,060
they are not my parents.

666
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,670
But if they are fake,

667
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,210
why would they do that?

668
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,300
And why do they

669
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,130
look exactly like your parents?

670
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,730
I've observed them these days.

671
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,850
The two of them

672
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,310
are not disguised

673
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,390
nor created with Eternal power.

674
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,540
Have you heard that there was a secret technique in ancient times?

675
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,050
Called puppetry.

676
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,420
No trespassing

677
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,840
the Divine Maiden's room.

678
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,910
Who are you?

679
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,510
I'm the only doctor in Bodhi Village,

680
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,340
[Qin Jiang, doctor of Bodhi Village]

681
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,420
Qin Jiang.

682
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,400
The Divine Maiden is sick.

683
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,630
She won't see any guests for now.

684
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,630
Please leave.

685
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,460
Sick?

686
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Coincidentally,

687
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,030
there are many elixirs in Bright Moon Palace.

688
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,560
Let me see what ailment she has

689
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,840
so that I can treat her.

690
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,600
She just fell asleep after taking the medicine.

691
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,920
Please leave.

692
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,770
Fan Yue!

693
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,850
What's wrong with her?

694
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,210
The Bodhi Village

695
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,750
is protected by the Divine Maiden.

696
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,120
All the food and water in the village are made by the Divine Maiden.

697
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,020
She used too much of her spiritual power

698
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,370
and needs to sleep and rest.

699
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,850
She will wake up in a few days.

700
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,080
So,

701
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,159
she set up the fog around the village?

702
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,320
She knew she was going to fall into deep slumber.

703
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,360
She was worried that

704
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,510
something would happen in Bodhi Village without her protection.

705
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,880
That's why she set up the fog

706
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,340
to stop people from entering and exiting.

707
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,239
The Divine Maiden did this for the sake of the villagers.

708
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,480
When she wakes up a few days later,

709
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,840
she'll undo the fog.

710
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,210
But now,

711
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,500
please leave.

712
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,429
Don't disturb her rest.

713
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,730
Fan Yue.

714
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,810
Don't believe her.

715
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,110
Fan Yue!

716
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,150
Fan Yue.

717
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,370
Your power and divine soul have been imprisoned

718
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,870
by the Divine Maiden.

719
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,880
No matter how loudly you shout,

720
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,110
he won't hear you.

721
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,070
Just lie there obediently.

722
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,440
How did it go?

723
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,240
Luan Zhu is sleeping.

724
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,790
She'll wake up in a few days.

725
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,970
Do you believe it?

726
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,290
No.

727
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,160
With your personality,

728
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,120
you should've gotten to the bottom of things.

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,950
Why did you come back?

730
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,180
Could it be

731
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,630
you still care about your relationship with her 60,000 years ago?

732
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,310
No.

733
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,240
I know.

734
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,850
I'm just kidding.

735
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,490
It's getting late.

736
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,720
Go to bed early.

737
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,060
We can resolve

738
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,810
tomorrow's matters tomorrow.

739
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,480
This is your first time helping me undress.

740
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,770
Isn't it good?

741
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,500
It's okay.

742
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,750
I can do it myself.

743
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,780
He's here.

744
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,960
I suddenly remembered

745
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,440
Master hasn't taken his medicine tonight.

746
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,850
I'll go check on him.

747
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,640
Get some rest.

748
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,190
I'll be back soon.

749
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,560
Sect Leader, do you want to kill me?

750
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,580
What do you think about

751
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,170
my new skin?

752
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,010
Divine Maiden,

753
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,730
did Fan Yue notice that

754
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,900
you took Bai Shuo's body?

755
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,050
What?

756
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,950
Are you questioning my ability?

757
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,860
I dare not.

758
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,710
You are all-powerful.

759
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,000
I’m just curious

760
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,110
how you switched bodies with Bai Shuo

761
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,920
without anyone knowing?

762
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,190
Don't ask

763
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,660
what you shouldn't ask.

764
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,330
Divine Maiden, why did you suddenly

765
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,420
summon me here today?

766
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,270
I exchanged bodies with Bai Shuo

767
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,880
and used up a lot of spiritual power.

768
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,260
I need some nourishment.

769
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,280
Send some new Eternals in.

770
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,540
You're unwilling?

771
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
Back then,

772
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,570
Fan Yue came to our sect to steal the Contemplation Stone.

773
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,340
I deliberately didn't stop him

774
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,440
just to use him

775
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,610
to help me find someone who can gather the Five Contemplations.

776
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,870
Now, Bai Shuo has gathered four Contemplations.

777
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,680
We're one step away from success.

778
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,690
If you take her body now,

779
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,640
the Five Contemplations won't be gathered.

780
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,010
If we don't gather all five,

781
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,690
we can't activate the power of the divine stone.

782
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,860
All I want is Fan Yue.

783
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,360
I don't care if the Contemplation Stone

784
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,970
can be activated or not.

785
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,860
Jin Yao,

786
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,430
these years, I've taught you the secret mental cultivation methods,

787
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,150
helped you cultivate with spiritual power,

788
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,410
and made you the leader of the Eternals.

789
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,320
You've gotten enough.

790
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,730
You're still not satisfied?

791
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,660
You still want the power of the Contemplation Stone?

792
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,880
Those who are too greedy

793
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,710
don't meet good endings.

794
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,650
Stay in your place.

795
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,580
Don't forget that I gave you everything you have today.

796
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,570
I can take it back anytime.

797
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,600
Do you really want to die?

798
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,030
Who is it?

799
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,470
You can hear my voice?

800
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,060
For so many years,

801
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,480
you're the first one.

802
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,910
Stop looking.

803
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,430
I'm right in front of you.

804
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
What demonic object are you?

805
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,310
Demon?

806
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,450
Do you really want to die?

807
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,550
If you do,

808
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,840
I can help you.

809
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,120
Why don't you answer?

810
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,390
You don't want to answer

811
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,700
or do you not dare to?

812
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
You don't dare to die

813
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,450
nor do you want to die.

814
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,640
Who are you?

815
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,490
I'm not a demon

816
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,880
nor an eternal.

817
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,850
You should know

818
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,200
there once was a Divine Race.

819
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,340
Divine Race?

820
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,560
You are...

821
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
Jin Yao,

822
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,670
I know everything about you.

823
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,810
Your parents died young

824
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,250
and your family was poor.

825
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,630
You worked so hard to leave Bodhi Village

826
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,530
and joined the Lanling Sect,

827
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,140
but you were always oppressed by your peers because of your humble background.

828
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,620
You were humiliated.

829
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,950
You're in pain,

830
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,150
right?

831
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,350
Why?

832
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,480
Why do some people have everything when they are born?

833
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,070
I tried my best,

834
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,070
but I still couldn't get a slightly fair chance.

835
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,320
There is no fairness in this world.

836
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,850
If you want to rise above others,

837
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,960
I can help you.

838
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,710
I can give you power,

839
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,320
help you gain a foothold in Lanling,

840
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,800
help you become the leader of the Eternals,

841
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,540
and help you take revenge on those who bullied you.

842
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,520
Whether it's a sinister and despicable Senior,

843
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
or the unfair Master,

844
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,920
as long as you want,

845
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,220
they will all disappear from this world.

846
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,790
Don't you want such a good opportunity?

847
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,780
If not,

848
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,400
then forget it.

849
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,110
Wait.

850
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,790
What's the condition?

851
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,260
What do you want me to do?

852
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,480
60,000 years ago in the war of the Divine Region,

853
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,850
my spiritual soul was damaged.

854
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,550
I was in deep slumber until now.

855
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,440
I need to absorb the spiritual energy of Eternals

856
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,260
to maintain a human form.

857
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,290
You just need to give some Eternals to me regularly.

858
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,340
It's just a little favor.

859
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,480
I don't need you to sacrifice anything.

860
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,870
You just need to

861
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,830
forget your conscience.

862
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,360
That's all.

863
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,740
I will

864
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,320
always remember your kindness.

865
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,250
I dare not have improper thoughts.

866
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,890
But there is one more thing

867
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,200
I need your help with.

868
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,110
What is it?

869
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,920
When I was capturing

870
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,720
Chong Tai and Meng Ning back then,

871
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,120
I accidentally met Bai Shuo's sister, Bai Xi.

872
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,040
Father!

873
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,330
I'm going to get Father to save Aunt Meng.

874
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,220
Back then, Bai Xi was just a human child.

875
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,750
She didn't die after being hit by me twice

876
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,170
and became the current Fu Ling.

877
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,990
She didn't die after two strikes?

878
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,530
Interesting.

879
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,480
I'm not sure

880
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,670
if she saw my face or not.

881
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,030
Divine Maiden, please kill Fu Ling and Chong Zhao

882
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,840
in Bodhi Village.

883
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,710
Killing Fu Ling isn't strange,

884
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,300
but Chong Zhao is your personal disciple.

885
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,730
You've been his teacher for years.

886
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,110
Can you bear to be heartless?

887
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,030
He already suspects me.

888
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,910
If he must be killed, then so be it.

889
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,360
Sometimes I'm quite curious.

890
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,000
If the world's Eternals found out

891
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,290
that their leader

892
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,360
is such a ruthless

893
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,110
and sinful person,

894
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,600
how would they react?

895
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,740
I have other things to do.

896
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,100
Go back first.

897
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,720
I have my own considerations

898
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,310
for Bodhi Village's matters.

899
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,780
You don't need to intervene

900
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,340
or ask about it.

901
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,950
Yes.

902
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,870
I'll do as you say, Divine Maiden.

903
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,140
Why do I always feel that you are

904
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,430
different from before?
