1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Here it comes.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The first demon is the master.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A demon is a star.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A demon is a star.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A demon is a star.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The world is here.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We are here.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We are here.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We are here.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are here.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are here.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We are here.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We are here.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We are here.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We are here.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We are here.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want you to tell the gods that the goddess of the stars will marry into the demon clan.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then marry me in ten days.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What did you say?

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your memory...

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's boring to kill you or hurt you or be killed by you.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The goddess of the stars is in the world.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you marry me, you will be the biggest insult to the gods.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The gods can reject me.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But in ten days, the wedding will be a long and long one.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No matter what the ceremony is, I am happy to see it.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A marriage is a life.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The gods will choose it.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have finished the wedding.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In ten days,

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the goddess of the demons will be angry.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you really want to marry me?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are the goddess of the stars who is the highest and highest, right?

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She is so worthy of your life.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The long and long demon clan is the cause of my three years of life.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The gods are so precious.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The lives of the world are so precious.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Since the demon gods are so suspicious about the past,

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I am like the demon god.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's just a wedding.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The life of the world is so precious.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The goddess of the stars loves the world so much.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In ten days,

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will marry the gods and be the gods.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if you only have hatred for me,

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but before I disappear,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can still stay by your side in this way.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Even if only ten days are left.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't expect the gods to sleep so peacefully in the demon clan.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have been here for a long time.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
These are all the things that the elders have been used to.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Since you are awake,

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you can choose yourself.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The demon clan is in the dark.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The gods still love to protect their bodies.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't want to marry the gods after ten days.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am marrying a sick person.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How come your face is so pale?

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you really sick?

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I am not.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am just a sick person.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am just a sick person.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I am just a sick person.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I am just a sick person.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I am just a sick person.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you really sick?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I am not sick.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I am just a sick person.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I am just a sick person.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Really?

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you are not used to it,

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you can stay here and naturally become used to it.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you are not used to the other people's worries,

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you can choose yourself.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Qingyue, if we can be together,

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
if we can have each other again,

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think I will be very happy.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you not coming to see me?

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's been a hundred years.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The gods of Demon God are getting stronger.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There are only three days left to get married.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You came here at this time.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You should have come earlier.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why do you have to pretend to be stupid?

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I made an appointment with you.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When I was in the battle with Xing Yue,

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you destroyed the Star Moon Palace.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
After the trial, we were together.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But you were so annoying.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You wasted my chance to plan it.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I made an appointment with you.

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You destroyed the Star Moon Palace.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I said that

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the people who win the battle

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
are the gods of the hell.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But we have not succeeded.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We have already done it.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Besides, it's been a hundred years.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm afraid that today you came here

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to do this.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I came here today

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to take Xing Yue away.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He will become my god.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't be so selfish.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He won't fall in love with you.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Otherwise, how could you be so weak

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in the battle with Xing Yue three years ago?

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How do you know?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have never

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ever seen this pair of eyes.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then you don't need to keep these eyes.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Stop!

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is the hell.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think it's not appropriate

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
for you to do this.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Before I came here,

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I saved Chang Qing from the Night Clan.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I left.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Really?

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I have always done nothing wrong.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It seems that the wedding of the three days later

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
should be held in my Night Clan.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And the person I want to marry

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
seems to be not the god of the hell.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
After three days,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will win the wedding of the sea.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will be your bride.

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't bear to do this.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Xing Yue!

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Shouldn't you give me an answer?

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the fate of your life.

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is so miserable.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't you want to teach him a lesson?

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I always like to solve my own problems.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will never be able to solve them.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You forced Xing Chen to break the law of the world.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will be punished.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But you are not in the world.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I said three years ago

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that your 100 years of friendship

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is meaningless to me.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why do you have to take the opportunity to marry yourself?

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Xing Yue!

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Master,

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
for me

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
only one problem solved,

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I am really curious

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
if you are stucked by the Demonic Stone

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because of a long experience.

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If I don't make it,

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
will you be able to solve this problem?

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I am really curious

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
about if you have been stucked

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
with the Demon God through Wallend

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
even during this lifetime,

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
If Shen Zun doesn't go,

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
are you really going to marry him?

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
The demon god broke out of the demon clan and was secretive.

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
At least I have to stay with him

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to see how much he has power now.

169
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Jing Yuan is even more than enough for your love.

170
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,000
God really didn't mean to hurt him.

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Didn't you see my heart just now?

172
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,200
It's really a long-awaited goddess.

173
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Only I can be with you in this world.

174
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
And only you can be with me.

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
After three days, Yueyin Sea is our wedding gift.

176
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
God!

177
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Jing Yuan, how is he?

178
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Even the power of the demon god is not enough to make him feel better.

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
The demon god has no answer.

180
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I will send him to the demon clan as per the order of the god.

181
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
He was just a new god.

182
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
So he didn't notice.

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
When he wakes up,

184
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,200
he will know that the demon god has no power.

185
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
He has no power left.

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,200
He will not leave the temple easily.

187
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Only he can see me killing Jing Yuan.

188
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Only he can believe that the god of the demon god is true.

189
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Only he can use the star of the demon god to trap him.

190
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
To kill him.

191
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Xiu Yan, you did a good job.

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
God, if you are trapped in the demon clan,

193
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
you can't rush back to the New Moon Tai Feng Ni.

194
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Your power will disappear faster.

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I know.

196
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I can feel the guilt of the power inside me.

197
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I have not much time left.

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
God.

199
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Don't do that.

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Even if it's the god,

201
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I will have a day to die.

202
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
But before I disappear,

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I have one last thing to do.

204
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
The new moon palace has known the reality of the evil spirit.

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Before I disappear,

206
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I need to find the person who trained Xie Gong.

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Kill him.

208
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I need your help.

209
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
God, you say.

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
The whole god world, except me,

211
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
only Jing Yuan and Mo Li's power can be able to trap the three gods.

212
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
So I have to go to the demon clan.

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
If the person who trained Xie Gong is not Jing Yuan,

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
then only the shadow lord Mo Li is left.

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I will keep the law in the demon clan.

216
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
And you

217
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
need to keep the information around Jing Yuan

218
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
to let the shadow lord know.

219
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Yes.

220
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Don't worry.

221
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Everything will end in three days.

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
God, the demon god will wake up in three days.

223
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
He will know all this.

224
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
But you already...

225
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Shuyuan.

226
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
As the god,

227
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I should bear the responsibility of the god.

228
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
But as the new moon,

229
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I wish he can live.

230
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I have a dream in your eyes.

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
As long as you do this for me,

232
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I can help you draw the god's face.

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Are you willing to do it?

234
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Very good.

235
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
From today on,

236
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
you are the eyes of the new moon.

237
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I will tell you everything that happened in the new moon.

238
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I will tell you everything.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I will tell you everything.

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I will tell you everything.

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I will tell you everything that happened in the new moon.

242
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
One day,

243
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
you will get what you want.

244
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Three days later,

245
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I will let the god,

246
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
except the shadow lord,

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
be gone.

248
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
D.

249
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Jingyuan.

250
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Why are you here?

251
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
We are getting married.

252
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I am not here.

253
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
I picked this one.

254
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Is it pretty?

255
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
It's pretty.

256
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Then we'll use this to

257
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
bring the spirit of the demon to our wedding.

258
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll take it.

259
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
What are you looking at?

260
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm looking at Ziyue.

261
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
When I was in the nightclub,

262
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I often heard you say that the demon clan was lonely and beautiful.

263
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I was always disturbed by the others.

264
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I didn't pay much attention to them.

265
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I was so stubborn at night.

266
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Then do you like Zhuliu?

267
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I like him.

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Then let's stay here forever, okay?

269
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
If you don't like this, we can go together.

270
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
We'll stay here forever.

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Xing Yue, are we really going to get married?

272
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,200
You know what I am.

273
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Do you know when I fell in love with you?

274
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
When I gave you the firefly,

275
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I was drinking with you.

276
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Then we went to the moon and the sea together.

277
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Do you remember the day you entered the nightclub?

278
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I recognized you.

279
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
You fell in love with me?

280
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Not really.

281
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I was looking at you that day.

282
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I thought that a demon god

283
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,200
would do such a thing.

284
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
To destroy the palace,

285
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I wanted to be a little god.

286
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
So I got some interest.

287
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I understand.

288
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I am willing to see you

289
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
and be with you.

290
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Xing Yue, I am very happy.

291
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
What are you happy about?

292
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Everything.

293
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I am happy that you are with me

294
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
when you are away from me.

295
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I am happy that you are willing to see me.

296
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I am happy that we are going to get married.

297
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I am happy.

298
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I am happy.

299
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
You are the blue earth in my life.

300
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,200
I am happy.

301
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Let tears fall on you.

302
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Xing Yue, if this is a dream,

303
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I hope that I will never wake up.

304
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I am happy.

305
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Xing Yue, I am sorry.

306
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
I am happy.

307
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I am happy.

308
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
You are the one who woke me up?

309
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Yes.

310
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
He had a dream for me.

311
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
He trapped me in a dream.

312
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
But you forced me to wake up.

313
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Xing Yue, what do you and your God want to do?

314
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
God doesn't want to do anything.

315
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
He had a dream.

316
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Maybe he just wanted to make a wish.

317
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Wish?

318
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I think it is just a trick

319
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
to manipulate my hand.

320
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Do you think I will be fooled by your lies?

321
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
God, didn't you find out that Xing Yue was dead?

322
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Did I hurt you?

323
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Why?

324
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
His power has gone weak.

325
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Why?

326
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Because of you.

327
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Because of me?

328
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Because God loves you.

329
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Xing Yue, this is the best joke I have heard in my life.

330
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I have confessed my sins to him.

331
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
He bullied me, hurt me, and used me.

332
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
If this is also a secret,

333
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I will not be able to keep my promise.

334
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I will not be able to keep my promise.

335
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Then I will be really in trouble.

336
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
All that God did is to protect your life.

337
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Tell me clearly.

338
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
What is the name of my life?

339
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Do you think God is a immortal without a heart?

340
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
He didn't have a choice.

341
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Xing Yue is the God of the Universe.

342
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
God only wants to leave all his emotions

343
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
to use Xing Yue's power to use God's power.

344
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Everyone thinks that Wu Nian Shi is the God of the Wind and the Shadow.

345
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Actually, he is the God of the Universe.

346
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,200
But now, Wu Nian Shi can't seal his love for you.

347
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
His power in his body is scattered day by day.

348
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
In the end, even the beast can't keep it.

349
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
But even if he dies,

350
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
God didn't give up loving you.

351
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,200
He gave up the God of the Universe.

352
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
It's your fate.

353
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
God told me to keep it from you.

354
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
But how could I watch him take the wrong side?

355
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I am so angry.

356
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I am so angry.

357
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
This is Wu Nian Shi.

358
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
He broke the God's seal.

359
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I want you to remember everything.

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Xing Yue.

361
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
I only want to see God's curse with his beloved.

362
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,200
And not Xing Yue's shadow.

363
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I want to be with you forever.

364
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Do you want to be my God?

365
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Why?

366
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Why should I kill him?

367
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
This is heaven.

368
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I am the power of the heavens and earth.

369
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,200
My existence is the law of the gods and the gods.

370
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,200
If the heavens want him dead, I will lie to them.

371
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
You have practiced the Blood Palace.

372
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
The gods agreed to marry them.

373
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
They wanted to die in the heart of the Moon and to be together with him.

374
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
There is not much time left.

375
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Maybe you can save him now.

376
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Xing Yue.

377
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Xing Yue,

378
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
you are my wife.

379
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
You are the god of the heavens and earth.

380
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
You are my wife.

381
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
From now on,

382
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I will never let you down.

383
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
You want to kill me?

384
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Mo Li,

385
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
you have practiced the Blood Palace and killed the gods.

386
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
The heavens and earth are not soft.

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
The heavens and earth are not soft.

388
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I am the god.

389
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I am the master of this world.

390
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Who is qualified to judge my sins?

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
The power of the stars and the laws of the heavens

392
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
and the peace of the gods are my wish.

393
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Xing Yue.

394
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Your power.

395
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
As you have seen,

396
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I have already grown up.

397
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
If it is not the love of the moon,

398
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
maybe I can kill it.

399
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
But now you are too weak.

400
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
You can't set out the whole of the gods of the stars and the moon.

401
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
You are not my opponent.

402
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
But don't worry.

403
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I won't kill you.

404
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Even if I kill you,

405
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I will have a new god of the stars and the stars.

406
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Xing Yue is my only client.

407
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
You are the famous judge of the gods.

408
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Why do you want to enter the Moon and Moon Sea?

409
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Because as long as I can control Xing Yue's power

410
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
with your magic,

411
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
you can enter the world.

412
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I am the one who will decide the future.

413
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
What else have you done?

414
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
This god of the moon

415
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
doesn't need another god other than my shadow tribe.

416
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Today,

417
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I am the main judge of the whole world.

418
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Such a big day.

419
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Of course, I need to use the blood of the Night Demon and the two tribes to celebrate.

420
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Mo Li.

421
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
You deserve to die.

422
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Xing Yue.

423
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
As long as you are angry with me,

424
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I can protect your spirit and your spirit.

425
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
You can live forever.

426
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
And I, the master of the Moon and the god of the moon,

427
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
can't you?

428
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Dream on.

429
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
It's okay.

430
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
When you and I get angry and suffer,

431
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
you will change your mind one day.

432
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
You have the spirit and the spirit.

433
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
When did you and the god of the moon get angry?

434
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Mo Li.

435
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
The god of the moon is certain.

436
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
You can never control Xing Yue's power.

437
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Even if you kill the god of the moon today,

438
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
there will be a day when the new god of the moon

439
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
will be born in the world.

440
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
By then,

441
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
it will be your death.

442
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
How can I not be as good as the god of the moon?

443
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
You chose him as your barrier.

444
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
You are not worthy of his body.

445
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I have always loved you.

446
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
I will always love you.

447
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
You choose others.

448
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

449
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I will never be your slave.

450
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Xing Yue.

451
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
No matter what happens today,

452
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
don't face it alone.

453
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I am here.

454
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I will die with you.

455
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
But never fight.

456
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Okay.

457
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Since you are begging to die,

458
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I will choose you.

459
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
After today,

460
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
the world will be my main asset.

461
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Jin Ren.

462
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Xing Yue.

463
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Lan Gong.

464
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Jin Ren.

465
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Do you want to die?

466
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Xing Yue.

467
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
You are the god of the moon.

468
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Lan Gong.

469
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Hurry up, Xing Yue.

470
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Lan Gong.

471
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Lan Gong.

472
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Lan Gong.

473
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Lan Gong.

474
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Lan Gong.

475
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Lan Gong.

476
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
You think you can kill me?

477
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
No.

478
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
You are heartless.

479
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
I will destroy the gods and the world.

480
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Destroy everything.

481
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I will not let you die.

482
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Xing Yue.

483
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
The god of the moon.

484
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
The god of the moon.

485
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
The last thing I can do

486
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
is to protect this star.

487
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Xing Yue.

488
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
You are my love.

489
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You are my love.

490
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Jin Ren.

491
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,200
You are my love.

492
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
You are my love.

493
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,200
You are my love.

494
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Xing Yue.

495
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Xing...

496
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Xing Yue.

497
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Xing Yue.

498
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
You are too strong.

499
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
With my power,

500
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
I can't destroy the world.

501
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I will start a new life.

502
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I will destroy the star.

503
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
The last thing I can do is to burn my power.

504
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I will start a new life.

505
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I will only use my power.

506
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
If I can't destroy the god,

507
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
the god will be gone.

508
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
But the world is still here.

509
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
It's not a dream.

510
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
The star is gone.

511
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
The world is gone.

512
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
My responsibility is to suppress the star.

513
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Then, Xing Yue.

514
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Your mission

515
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
is to kill the star

516
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
until Xing Yue's life is born.

517
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
No.

518
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Xing Jun.

519
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Xing Jun.

520
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
No.

521
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
No.

522
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I am gone.

523
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
I can't.

524
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I can't.

525
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I can't.

526
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I will destroy the star.

527
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,200
The star is gone.

528
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
The world is gone.

529
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,200
My responsibility is to suppress the star.

530
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Remember.

531
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Only the power of Xing Yue's power

532
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
can destroy the star.

533
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Remember.

534
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I will bring everything back to normal.

535
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Xing Jun.

536
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Xing Jun.

537
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Xing Yue will definitely use his life to protect me.

538
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
To protect my heart.

539
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
To protect my life.

540
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I will protect my life.

541
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
The heart will not destroy the place it is.

542
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
So, Xing Yue has become

543
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
the only place in the world.

544
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
To be honest,

545
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
you are the one I have to wait for.

546
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
No.

547
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Xing Yue, Jing Yuan, and Mo Li

548
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
are gone.

549
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Why can they re-establish the world?

550
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
The world has three gods in the universe.

551
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
The gods have life and body.

552
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
But the gods have no existence.

553
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
As long as the gods are there,

554
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
there is a possibility to re-establish the world.

555
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
But in this kind of possibility,

556
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
no one knows how long it takes.

557
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
It takes 60,000 years to wait for you.

558
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
It is a lucky thing.

559
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
But I met Jing Yuan ten years ago.

560
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
He was still in the world.

561
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
This is also the reason why I can't be the one to re-establish the world.

562
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Maybe Jing Yuan only knows

563
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
the reason for re-establishing the world.

564
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
What about Chong Zhao?

565
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
You haven't answered me.

566
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Why did the gods leave the world?

567
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Because the heavens are in chaos.

568
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
The heavens are in chaos.

569
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
At the moment when the gods are gone,

570
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
they have entered the chaos.

571
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
They can't control the direction of the gods.

572
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
So, after Zhen Yu escaped from the gods,

573
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
they spent 60,000 years to find you.

574
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Zhen Yu?

575
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
That little black snake is Zhen Yu.

576
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,200
It was the first time he was able to open the door.

577
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
So he couldn't control your desire.

578
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
The only thing he can remember is that

579
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
he was a trusted and respected person.

580
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
He was a good person.

581
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
He was also a mess.

582
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Because of the endless increase in the life of the gods,

583
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
he fell into the East.

584
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
He hated you and killed Jing Yuan.

585
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,200
So he wanted to kill you.

586
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,200
I asked him why he didn't do it himself.

587
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Instead, he wanted Chong Zhao to kill me.

588
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Because only the gods can kill the gods completely.

589
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
60,000 years ago,

590
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Xing Yue couldn't kill Mo Li and Jing Yuan completely.

591
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
It was because of his weak power.

592
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
If Chong Zhao really killed you,

593
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
you would have been in a deep disarray

594
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,200
and never have a chance to get back together.

595
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
So it was like this.

596
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
It's still not right.

597
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
60,000 years ago,

598
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Wu Nian Shi was the only god in your hands.

599
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
But why did you say you were dead?

600
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Why did Wu Nian Shi die in the forest?

601
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
The time he was in the forest

602
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
actually hit me badly.

603
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I knew that I couldn't live long.

604
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
But I had to bear the promise of the gods.

605
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I didn't want to let the gods die in the middle of the city.

606
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
So I went to the East.

607
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I saw a cave.

608
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
The new scriptures and stories

609
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
that the gods have passed on to me

610
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,200
were all hidden in the forest.

611
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
I think that one day,

612
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
someone might come here

613
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
to witness the history of the gods

614
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
and the destruction of the world.

615
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Wu Nian Shi was completely shocked

616
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
when he was in the forest.

617
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I felt that the new god of Xing Yue

618
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
would be born in the East.

619
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
So I handed Wu Nian Shi

620
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
to the most holy god of the forest.

621
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
I left the god's jade

622
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
to each of the leaders

623
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,200
to wait and help a girl who can restart Wu Nian Shi.

624
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Unfortunately,

625
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,200
the secret was not the key to the past.

626
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,200
After that, I returned to the Moon Sea.

627
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I was left with no choice but to leave.

628
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I kept my guard for a long time.

629
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I left because of the injury.

630
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,200
The god left me in the jade cage.

631
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,200
So I could live a life of my own.

632
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,200
But why did you tell me now?

633
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Why did you know my kindness?

634
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Because you are just a human being

635
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
who has never experienced anything.

636
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,200
You don't even know what the fairy demon is.

637
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
You don't know what the guardian is.

638
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
The fairy is a good person.

639
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
She can help you to survive.

640
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Now, you have experienced many lives

641
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
and you have been able to save the god

642
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,200
even if you have a new day.

643
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
If I am really a god,

644
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
why can't I return to the Moon Sea

645
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
and save the god?

646
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I didn't expect

647
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
that the Moon Sea would be the Moon Sea

648
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
when I found the cave.

649
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,200
The seven stars and the soul are not my plan.

650
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
It's not what I want.

651
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Now, I can only help you to keep it alive.

652
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
As for the rest,

653
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I can't do anything about it.

654
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
But to be honest,

655
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
it's not the time for sadness.

656
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I told you everything today.

657
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,200
It's because the Moon Sea can't hold on to the star.

658
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Why?

659
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
It's been 60,000 years.

660
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,200
The power of the power of the power will disappear.

661
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Without the power of the star and the jade,

662
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
the star will be gone.

663
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
The Moon Sea will not exist.

664
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I can only use the five-spirit stone

665
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,200
in your body to keep the star.

666
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,200
But it's not the time for the long-awaited.

667
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
To be honest,

668
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
you only need to find the star and the god.

669
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
To completely destroy the star

670
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,200
to avoid the world.

671
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,200
The Moon Sea

672
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,200
Why do you always think of me?

673
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Come on, come on.

674
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,200
My heart is so excited.

675
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Wait for me.

676
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,200
The star is shining in your eyes.

677
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,200
You are the light I want to see.

678
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,200
You are the only reason I'm here.

679
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,200
Let this moment be with you.

680
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:47,200
I want to see the moon in the sky.

681
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:55,200
The star is shining in your eyes.

682
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,200
You are the blue earth I want to see.

683
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Let this moment be with you.

684
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Let this moment be with you.

685
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Let this moment be with you.

686
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,200
I'm here.
