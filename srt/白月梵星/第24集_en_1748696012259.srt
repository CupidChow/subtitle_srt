1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Flimsy was a full-time striker named

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,520
comic writing

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Assistant director

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,580
A lighter

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,580
I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,580
The world is here.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,580
We are here.

8
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,580
I only want to be with the one I love.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,580
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,580
You and him are not the same person.

11
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
From here it's from where I belong.

12
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,280
Then you remember your dream.

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,580
Apart from that, how about...

14
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,580
..the Novtil space between us.

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
Pick the cloth and squeeze it out.

16
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,580
Memphis is your...

17
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,260
**

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,120
you and me

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
life over history

20
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,380
Some have been dreaming of being analogged to her

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:51,460
Some have been drawing었OTH

22
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
I will find a way to save him.

23
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Master, there is nothing in this box.

24
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,460
It is indeed the dead and the revived.

25
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,460
Maybe he is not dead at all.

26
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,460
He is pretending to be dead.

27
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
I will find a way to save him.

28
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
I will find a way to save him.

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
The dead and the revived.

30
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
This is...

31
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,460
The blood of Qi Feng and the same blood as the one of the hidden talismans.

32
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,460
If I knew who used this blood to harm him,

33
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
I would have killed him.

34
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Cang Shan,

35
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
go and see if your mother is back.

36
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,460
I have something to ask her.

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
Why don't you suck out the blood of the evil?

38
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
I can't suck it out.

39
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Then why can't you suck out the blood of the evil?

40
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
It is because the leader is dead.

41
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Unless the leader dies,

42
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
otherwise, I can't suck it out.

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
What about Qi Feng?

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,460
What about Qi Feng?

45
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
I have protected his heart with my waist.

46
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,460
I can't hurt him with my blood.

47
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Master, Uncle Bai,

48
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
my mother is not back yet.

49
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Cang Shan, you stay here and look after Qi Feng.

50
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
The people here have a misunderstanding about you.

51
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,460
You can't walk around without thinking.

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Fan Yue and I will go to see your mother.

53
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
My mother will be fine.

54
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,460
Right?

55
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
No matter what,

56
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
I will definitely punish the murderer for the harm of the dead.

57
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,460
Father, what are you doing?

58
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,460
I'm not leaving. What are you doing?

59
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,460
Hurry up.

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Father, can you tell me what happened?

61
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Why did you leave the clan?

62
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
Don't ask so much.

63
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
I'm your father. Of course I won't harm you.

64
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
You must leave now.

65
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
I won't leave.

66
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
You don't tell me clearly.

67
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,460
I won't go anywhere.

68
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,460
The leader is dead.

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
You are the elder in the clan.

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,460
If you leave, what about the people?

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
It's because the leader is dead.

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
We have to leave now.

73
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Didn't you say that the leader was killed by Cang Shan?

74
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Are you afraid of Cang Shan?

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Or you say that father,

76
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,460
you are afraid of someone else.

77
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Cang Shan is the child I saw growing up.

78
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
I don't know what his nature is like.

79
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,460
How could he be a master?

80
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
You were the one who killed him in front of the whole clan.

81
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I was the one who hid behind the back.

82
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Anyway, it's not a delay.

83
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Hurry up and leave.

84
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Who is the leader of the clan?

85
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Master.

86
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
You are finally awake.

87
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
How is it?

88
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
Did you feel any discomfort?

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
No.

90
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm fine.

91
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
The master is in your room.

92
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
He has a demon.

93
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
He protected the heart.

94
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,460
You will be fine for now.

95
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
A Yue is still good to me.

96
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm fine.

97
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,460
I'm fine.

98
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
I'm fine.

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I'm fine.

100
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
A Yue is still good to me.

101
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
I've been lying down for too long.

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I have a little bit of a cramp.

103
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
Can you please help me

104
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,460
to get the cramp on my arm?

105
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
It's cold at night.

106
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
You should protect your legs.

107
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Don't get cold.

108
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
The leader of the clan is so enthusiastic about anyone.

109
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
You are the master's family.

110
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
I will take good care of you.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
You are the master of the clan.

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Why do you want to be a guard

113
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
in A Yue's room

114
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
as a housekeeper?

115
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm not the master of the clan.

116
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
I've been away from the clan for a long time.

117
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
I kept the demon clan for a long time.

118
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
Until I met the owner of the house.

119
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
I was able to establish the housekeeper's house

120
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
and I finally have a place to live.

121
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
If the demon clan is weak and strong,

122
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
if the owner doesn't protect me,

123
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
I'm afraid I'll die

124
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
in the hands of other demons.

125
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
I heard from A Yue that

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,460
you left the clan because the clan was old.

127
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
You took such good care of me.

128
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
Did you think about

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,460
your father who had broken my head?

130
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
My father did such a mistake.

131
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
I saw you

132
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
and always wanted to take good care of me.

133
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
My legs are not convenient.

134
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
I need your help to get the medicine in the cabinet.

135
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
The cabinet?

136
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Okay.

137
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Why are you laughing?

138
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
I thought you would get the gift soon.

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
I can't wait to see the news.

140
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,460
撕

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Mother.

142
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Mother!

143
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,460
He's been dead for a long time.

144
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,460
How can a dead person wake him up?

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,460
It's you who killed my mother.

146
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Not only your father,

147
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460
but also those ten tribes.

148
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
You all have to die!

149
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
I'll kill you!

150
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
Why?

151
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
My father and you are innocent.

152
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Why did you kill them?

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Innocent?

154
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Cang Shan,

155
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,460
look who I am.

156
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
You...

157
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
What?

158
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
The bell is ringing?

159
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
How?

160
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,460
You can't recognize the bell that rings when the bell rings?

161
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Father!

162
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
I've made it clear.

163
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm not leaving.

164
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,460
What...what are you doing?

165
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Since the tribe is in danger, I must stay!

166
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
You've been in the prison for the whole life.

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,460
You can go to the valley now and live in peace.

168
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
But I'm your son, I can't leave.

169
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,460
Father, when I find out that the tribe is in danger,

170
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
I'll go to pick you up.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
Shut up!

172
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,460
You're the only good person you can be.

173
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,460
This is not a waste of time.

174
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
I said I must leave now.

175
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Remember,

176
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
life is more important than anything.

177
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Even if you hate me,

178
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
I'll have to live well.

179
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Father!

180
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I understand your loyalty.

181
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
You're a greedy man.

182
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,460
You're really making people feel guilty.

183
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
You...

184
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
What happened to the tribe?

185
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
You're so scared.

186
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
Why are you here?

187
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,460
The owner came to the tribe to find the murderer.

188
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
You're leaving without saying goodbye.

189
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Is this the way you treat the tribe?

190
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
I didn't invite you here.

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
The tribe is in danger.

192
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
The tribe will solve it.

193
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Please go back.

194
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I'll ask you one last time.

195
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
What happened to the tribe?

196
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,460
Father, please tell us.

197
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Cang Shan said that the owner of the house came to help us.

198
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Our tribe has always been a mountain.

199
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,460
But if that thing is known,

200
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
no one will be willing to help the tribe anymore.

201
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,460
The tribe has always been a poison.

202
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,460
It's been a thousand years.

203
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,460
The tribe was in danger.

204
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
The tribe was in a mess.

205
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,460
The patient is as soft as mud.

206
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,460
He can't control it.

207
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
He's in pain.

208
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Xiaolei.

209
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Does it hurt?

210
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
Here, the medicine is here.

211
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Here it is.

212
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Go and get the medicine for the tribe.

213
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
What's this?

214
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,460
This is the medicine for the tribe.

215
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
Do you want to see it?

216
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Do you want to see the tribe die?

217
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
Yes.

218
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Hurry up.

219
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,460
I remember I couldn't walk at that time.

220
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,460
I thought I couldn't stand up anymore.

221
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,460
Later, the tribe leader and a few elders brought the medicine back to the jar.

222
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
That's good.

223
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,460
What's the medicine in the jar?

224
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,460
It's a bone soup.

225
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,460
We've finished the tribe's food.

226
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
We've eaten their bones.

227
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
What?

228
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
The tribe's life is hard.

229
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
They're dead.

230
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,460
But they have the spirit of the tribe.

231
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
They can live on their bones.

232
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,460
We've been helpless.

233
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
This is the only way.

234
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Father.

235
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Father.

236
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
It's so confusing.

237
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
But it's a cause.

238
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
I can't die.

239
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,460
I don't care.

240
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I only want you to live.

241
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,460
The tribe has never had a life like this.

242
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Why do we have to be so stubborn?

243
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,460
We've been digging the bones of dead people.

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
They've died.

245
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,460
But their spirit can save the whole tribe.

246
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Why can't they eat it?

247
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Eat it.

248
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,460
So the murderer broke the bones of the elders.

249
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
That's a punishment.

250
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
It's a revenge.

251
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
He's avenged.

252
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,460
He came from the whole tribe.

253
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
He came from the mountain.

254
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,460
What does this have to do with the mountain?

255
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,460
There was a young man in the tribe.

256
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
He was standing in front of the village.

257
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
He was standing in front of the village.

258
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
The mountain was full of people.

259
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
He couldn't control himself.

260
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,460
So he broke the bones of the young man.

261
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Which tribe is the Shanggui tribe you're talking about?

262
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Bai Ze tribe.

263
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
What did you say?

264
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
What did you say?

265
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Father.

266
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Father.

267
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Fengyuan.

268
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Let go of me.

269
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Let go of me.

270
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
Father.

271
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Father.

272
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Are you all right?

273
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Bai Ze's will was what they went to.

274
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
The young man in the tribe was Qi Feng.

275
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
If that's the case,

276
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
oh no.

277
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Cang Shan.

278
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
You're the young man in the tribe.

279
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
You...

280
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
No way.

281
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
You're dead.

282
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Of course you don't want me to die.

283
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,460
If I die,

284
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,460
no one will know that you're the real me.

285
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
Did your parents tell you

286
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
that the master of the land

287
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
in the Shanggui tribe

288
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,460
was Bai Ze?

289
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Don't forget.

290
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
Your owner is Bai Ze.

291
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
If he knows your whereabouts,

292
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
you'll guess

293
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
if he will kill the master himself.

294
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
No.

295
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
I won't.

296
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,460
The master is the master.

297
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
He's not in the whole tribe.

298
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,460
To me,

299
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
the whole tribe

300
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
is not innocent.

301
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
By the way,

302
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I have something to tell you.

303
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
The reason I can control your father

304
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
is because he gave you

305
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
the evil power

306
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
that he suppressed you

307
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
to suppress you.

308
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
He gave you his own waist.

309
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
He didn't want you to be blame.

310
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
He changed your memory

311
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
and put all your mistakes

312
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
on him.

313
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
What did you say?

314
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
How touching and touching

315
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,460
the father and son are.

316
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
It's like what the real man thinks.

317
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
What waist?

318
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
What kind of memory?

319
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Since you don't remember anything,

320
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
I'll help you again.

321
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
I'll help you.

322
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
You're not A-Yue.

323
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Who are you?

324
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
What are you doing?

325
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Brother.

326
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Cangshan.

327
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Cangshan.

328
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Cangshan.

329
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Cangshan.

330
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Calm down.

331
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Cangshan.

332
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
What are you doing?

333
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,460
What are you doing?

334
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Calm down.

335
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
Cui.

336
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Cui.

337
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Your father's waist is so dangerous.

338
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
It's like his love.

339
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
It's the same evil spirit.

340
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Cui.

341
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Cui.

342
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
I'll kill you.

343
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
I'll kill you.

344
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
I'll kill you.

345
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I'll kill you.

346
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I'll kill you.

347
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
I'll kill you.

348
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
I'll kill you.

349
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Kill.

350
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,220
Help.

351
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Cangshan is殺.

352
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Help.

353
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Cangshan is killed.

354
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,180
Young master, what happened?

355
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,100
Look, over there

356
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,900
Help!

357
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,060
You...

358
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,420
Kill you變成你,我殺了你

359
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,820
Sersection, sorry!

360
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Kill him! I'll kill you!

361
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
I'll kill you!

362
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,460
Yan! Kill you!

363
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,460
Kill you! I'll kill you!

364
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,460
Kill him!

365
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
I'll kill him!

366
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Tang Shan! Your father is a mother!

367
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
He's not a child!

368
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
He's a monster! Kill him!

369
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Kill him! Kill him!

370
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,460
He's a brother! He killed my parents and my family!

371
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,460
He's the murderer! He's the murderer!

372
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Xifeng is a cruel man! He's a monster!

373
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
How could he kill someone?

374
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
We saw his murder!

375
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
You still want to kill him?

376
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,460
We won't believe you anymore!

377
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Kill him! Kill him!

378
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Kill him! Kill him!

379
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Stop!

380
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Kill him!

381
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
He's not a murderer! You can't kill him!

382
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Miss Bai, we call you the friend of the Hall of Fame.

383
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
We've been here for a few days.

384
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,460
But today is our own business!

385
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
We can't let you get involved!

386
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
Yes!

387
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,460
He's the one who's in the Hall of Fame.

388
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,460
He's the one in the Hall of Fame.

389
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
We should not interfere with the evil.

390
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,460
The Hall of Fame is so dangerous!

391
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
If this is too much,

392
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,460
what does the Shi Clan do to the Bai Clan?

393
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,460
They kill the Emperor, the Soul Master, the Shiyi Valley,

394
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
and the Soul Master.

395
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
It's not too much!

396
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
It's not a crime!

397
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
I knew you'd come.

398
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Is this the heart of the brotherhood?

399
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
By the way,

400
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
I'm sorry I'm late.

401
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,460
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,460
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,460
I'm sorry.

409
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
By the way,

410
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,460
I should also give my name to the Hall of Fame.

411
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,460
I've seen the Hall of Fame in the Cold Palace.

412
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
You did everything for the Shi Clan.

413
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
You have a answer in your heart.

414
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
You have to ask what you know.

415
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Yes.

416
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,460
The Cang Fu, Cang Mu, and those elders

417
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
were all killed by me.

418
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
I don't know.

419
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
All the Shi Clan members will die in my hands.

420
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Shi Clan is innocent,

421
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
but they don't know how to kill the Clan.

422
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,460
They don't know how to kill the Clan?

423
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Master Dian Chu,

424
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
you're so broad-minded.

425
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Shi Clan is fighting for the Bai Ze's land,

426
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
and they're trying to steal the ancient relics from the Bai Ze.

427
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
In order to cover up the crime,

428
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
they set up a stone town to suppress the Bai Ze's will.

429
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Fan Yuan,

430
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
why do they have to do this?

431
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

432
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
If I had known...

433
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,460
If you had known earlier, would you have killed the Shi Clan?

434
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,460
You even said that just now.

435
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,460
The Shi Clan is the most innocent.

436
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Fan Yuan,

437
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,460
the person who is most qualified to avenge the Bai Ze is you.

438
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,460
It's you who brought the dead to the Bai Ze.

439
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,460
If it weren't for you, nothing would have happened.

440
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,460
I wouldn't have been so unable to live.

441
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Why did you ask me earlier?

442
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
I also want to know

443
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,460
why the person who was abandoned by my father and the Clan was me.

444
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Why was the person who was broken by the Cang Shan's leg?

445
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Why was I the one who was living like the Song family?

446
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,460
What did you do in those years that I was in pain?

447
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
You were busy with your business,

448
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
with your goodwill,

449
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,460
and you were busy with the King of Ji Yu.

450
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Fan Yuan,

451
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,460
why did you have to fight with me?

452
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Everyone, don't listen to him.

453
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,460
How could a traitor know so much?

454
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
He was sick to save Cang Shan.

455
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
That's why he was so ridiculous.

456
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
Look at Hu Yan.

457
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
It's not nonsense.

458
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,460
What he said just now is true.

459
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,460
I also have a part of that incident.

460
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
I and the Clan Leader and some elders

461
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
have dug up the powder of Shanggu Clan

462
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,460
and put those bones in the medicine

463
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,460
to help the sick people.

464
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Everyone, this has nothing to do with Cang Shan.

465
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,460
That white bone of the past was not dead.

466
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
He is now in the Talisman of Revenge.

467
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Talisman of Revenge?

468
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Cang Shan, are you alright?

469
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
He has killed so many people.

470
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,460
He will kill me and all of us.

471
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,460
I believe that everyone is not really trying to kill Cang Shan.

472
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
It's just because he is too scared.

473
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
That's why he made a decision.

474
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
But this is unfair to Cang Shan.

475
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
The hatred of the past year

476
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
can't be taken by him alone.

477
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
That's right.

478
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
The Clan Leader is also a family.

479
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
We, the Clan Leader of the Ten Clans,

480
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
can't abandon our family because of fear.

481
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
Let Cang Shan go.

482
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
That's right.

483
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
We are all family.

484
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Let Cang Shan go alone.

485
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Let Cang Shan go alone.

486
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Come with me to the back.

487
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
No matter what year it is or what it is,

488
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
we all need to know each other.

489
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Your leg.

490
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,460
Why am I waiting for you and Shizu to come back?

491
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
My leg is broken.

492
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,460
The pain and torture of the past year are also broken.

493
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,460
It's the opportunity that Shizun gave me to stand up again.

494
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Shizun, I am very sorry.

495
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
I will give you a big gift of rice.

496
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
I will take you back to the Five-Year-Tian Clan.

497
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,460
I always appreciate your reputation.

498
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,460
You have been a member of the Xie Chong.

499
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
You have been a member of the Xie Chong.

500
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,460
You need to help me take back the Five-Year-Tian Clan.

501
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I will also help you fulfill your wish.

502
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
My leg.

503
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Come.

504
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Stand up and try.

505
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Come.

506
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Come.

507
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
How is it?

508
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Master Xie, I will not let you down.

509
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Remember,

510
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
people are not afraid of having.

511
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,460
They are afraid that after you have it,

512
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
you will lose it.

513
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Chenye,

514
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,460
I want you to remember this moment.

515
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
This feeling of standing up.

516
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,460
I hope that you will not lose it in the future.

517
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Yes.

518
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Shizun.

519
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
Your leg is broken.

520
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
The power of the antidote cannot cure you.

521
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,460
You can't do it. You have to cure my Shizun.

522
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I can't find out the power of this.

523
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Shizun has been a master for thousands of years.

524
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,460
How can you be so smart?

525
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Have you ever thought about it?

526
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
You have been in the Cold Spring Palace for years.

527
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
Why didn't he teach you?

528
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
I have a plan.

529
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Everything is worth it.

530
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Qi Feng, don't be controlled by him.

531
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Is it because of Shizun?

532
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
You don't have to say.

533
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
But in this Shizun,

534
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,460
everyone is under my control.

535
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
Shizun,

536
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I will kill you.

537
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,460
Yes, sir.

538
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
You can't take it.

539
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
What's wrong with them?

540
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
It's Xie Chong.

541
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,460
Qi Feng and Xie Chong have controlled all the Shizun.

542
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,460
You think I came to Shizun to play with you?

543
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Before you enter the Shizun,

544
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,460
I will give you the key to every Shizun.

545
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,460
I will give you the key to save you.

546
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
When did you give me the key?

547
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,460
You are the most guilty to me.

548
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
You haven't doubted me.

549
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,460
You put me in the food I prepared for you.

550
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,460
The demon king, Haoyue,

551
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,460
is not good at playing with you.

552
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,460
I especially trained you to play with this demon king.

553
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Even if you are a strong demon king,

554
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,460
you can't resist the spirit of this demon king.

555
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
Xie Chong is not good at playing with you.

556
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
If he loses his smile,

557
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
unless you die.

558
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Kill!

559
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
Master, how are you?

560
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
I'm fine.

561
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,460
I just have too much energy and lost my strength.

562
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,460
Master Bai, did you see anything?

563
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Shi Zhen...

564
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Shi Zhen is about to be killed.

565
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Bai Ze's spirit will be out soon.

566
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Bai Ze has more than ten people in his spirit.

567
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Once he is out,

568
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
he will be given the key to Qi Feng.

569
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
The Shizun will be dead.

570
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Master Bai, you go to the Hall of Halls first.

571
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
This is the wish of our ten tribes.

572
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I will solve it.

573
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
It's dangerous.

574
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,460
Master Bai, I only know that

575
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,460
my parents have been protecting me.

576
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
But I have no intention to harm them.

577
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,460
I have never been responsible for the Shizun's death.

578
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Now my parents are gone.

579
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,460
I should be responsible for the Shizun's death.

580
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,460
I can't let the people in the family be in trouble.

581
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Go to the Hall. Don't let her be in trouble.

582
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Cang Shan!

583
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Fan Yue.

584
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
You think you can save Cang Shan

585
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
by separating with Bai Shuo?

586
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Fan Yue, I want you to kill Cang Shan.

587
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
I will kill you.

588
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Your leg.

589
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
He really likes you.

590
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
He even reacts to it.

591
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
Fan Yue, where is he?

592
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
How did you kill him?

593
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
He has become my knife.

594
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
He will kill everyone who wants to kill me.

595
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,460
From the beginning of Cang Shan,

596
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,460
I really want to see

597
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,460
how he reacts to the blood of my brother.

598
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,460
So you don't hate him?

599
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,460
It's a lie from the beginning.

600
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,460
You were always in a hurry to get rid of the blood.

601
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Shouldn't you?

602
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
I have never experienced your pain.

603
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
I have no strength to endure it.

604
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
But you were taken away by the tiger tribe.

605
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
It's not Fan Yue's wish.

606
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
You lost the family.

607
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
It's not his wish.

608
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,460
He has been in peace for the past few years.

609
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
In fact,

610
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
you are not the only one who is in pain.

611
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
Yes.

612
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
I don't have a cup in this world.

613
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,460
It's painful.

614
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
But why?

615
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,460
He has always been chosen by others.

616
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,460
And I can only be abandoned and seen.

617
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
I can only make myself a monster

618
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
who can't be a monster.

619
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,460
But he is the king of the evil.

620
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
He is the master of the evil.

621
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
He is the master of the evil.

622
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,460
How much pain can he endure?

623
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Fan Yue is a monster.

624
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
He has been in a coma for a long time.

625
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
He has been in the blood of the mountain

626
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
for years to this day.

627
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,460
He is in search of you

628
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,460
to avenge the Bai Zezu tribe.

629
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,460
But you only hate him.

630
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,460
Isn't he despicable?

631
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
He is a monster.

632
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
Why can a young man

633
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,460
be the king of the evil in the short time?

634
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
He is strong and strong to increase his power

635
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
to make the world worse.

636
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
He is stronger.

637
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,460
The more powerful he is, the more he will be.

638
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Why do you think he is the master of the evil?

639
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Because only the god of the evil can save his life.

640
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
No.

641
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
You are lying to me.

642
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
How can a monster

643
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,460
be the king of the evil in the short time?

644
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,460
How can the monster be capable of changing his life

645
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
to replace the Bai Zezu's enemy?

646
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
A life of death is worth nothing for me.

647
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
I have been in the cold palace

648
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
for so many years

649
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
to kill the master

650
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
and kill Fan Yue.

651
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
I will not go.

652
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
This time I will bring you the master's life.

653
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
I will bring Wu Nian to you.

654
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Mr. Bai, you can't escape.

655
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,400
This might help...

656
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,260
rush forward.

657
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,620
At this time, it's too late.

658
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
A-Yue, don't leave.

659
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
A-Yue.

660
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
A-Yue, don't be angry.

661
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
I'm not good.

662
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,460
I shouldn't have beaten you and A-Mei.

663
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
A-Yue asked me to make a reputation for you,

664
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
but they didn't have me.

665
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,460
I did this myself.

666
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
I'll be your apology.

667
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Don't be angry, okay?

668
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,460
This time, I've finally made a name for myself.

669
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,460
I'll be your apology.

670
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,460
I'll be your apology.

671
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
I'll be your apology.

672
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
I'll forgive you this time.

673
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
I'll do my best.

674
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Let me say it again.

675
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Give me the child with the son.

676
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Why are your eyes turned purple?

677
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Don't give it to me.

678
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Qi Feng!

679
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Qi Feng!

680
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Qi Feng!

681
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
Why?

682
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
Why?

683
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Why?

684
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Why?

685
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,460
You want the child here?

686
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Come here.

687
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Qi Feng!

688
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,460
Why?

689
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
Qi Feng!

690
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
No!

691
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Qi Feng!

692
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
Why?

693
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
A-Yue!

694
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Why?

695
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
Why?

696
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,460
He's dead.

697
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
He's all dead.

698
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
I tried to escape from the house,

699
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
but I didn't understand.

700
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
How could you all die?

701
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
You're angry with me.

702
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Who should I go to for this account?

703
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,460
How could you all die?

704
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
How could you all die?

705
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,460
How could you all die?

706
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
How could you all die?

707
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
A-Yue!

708
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Why?

709
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
No...

710
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,460
No, A Yue's mother.

711
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
She's not dead.

712
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,460
A Yue's not dead?

713
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
A Yue!

714
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
A Yue!

715
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
You're not A Yue.

716
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
Who are you?

717
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,460
What are you doing?

718
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,460
A Yue!

719
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Are you heartless?

720
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,460
I can help you.

721
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,460
But I don't like weakness.

722
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
I'll become a strong woman.

723
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
Zheng Yu?

724
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,460
This is the Cold Palace?

725
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
From today on,

726
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,460
your name will be Chen Ye.

727
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

728
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,460
He's the Demon Lord of the Cold Palace, Chen Ye?

729
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,460
You have my own reasons.

730
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,460
But Cold Palace is not a good place.

731
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
You must throw away

732
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,460
all the hesitation and weakness.

733
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
You must become the strongest one.

734
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,460
You must become the one who is useful to me.

735
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
Otherwise,

736
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
you'll know what will happen.

737
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Prepare the shoes.

738
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
Yes, Your Highness.

739
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
A Xi!

740
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
A Xi!

741
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
Didn't you go to the Cloud Oil with this Taoist?

742
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Do you think you'll succeed in the Cold Palace?

743
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
A Xi!

744
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
A Xi!

745
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
A Xi!

746
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
A Xi!

747
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,460
A Xi!

748
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
A Xi!

749
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
How could the power of the Five-Nin-Ten

750
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
enter my memory?

751
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,460
What did you see?

752
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
Why did you remember A Xi?

753
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,460
Why did she bring Cold Palace?

754
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,460
What A Xi?

755
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,460
Your name is Zheng Yu.

756
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460
Where is the young lady in the Hall?

757
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
You want to know her information?

758
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,460
Yes.

759
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,460
She's always brought Cold Palace to the Cold Palace

760
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,460
with Fan Yue to die.

761
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
Cold Palace is a big city.

762
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,460
Maybe she's in a good mood.

763
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,460
She'll keep you alive.

764
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,460
You said you'd kill Fan Yue.

765
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,460
But you really hate her?

766
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,460
I saw some pictures

767
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,460
in your memory.

768
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,460
Qi Feng,

769
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
remember this.

770
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,460
A Yue is born to be a burden.

771
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
She's not only your brother.

772
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,460
She's also the one

773
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,460
you need to protect with your life.

774
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,460
A Yue, who is she?

775
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,460
She's not a good person.

776
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
But you need to promise me

777
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,460
to protect her.

778
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
I'll protect A Yue

779
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
with my life.

780
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,460
So,

781
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
when you were pushed to the Tiger Tribe,

782
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,460
when you were imprisoned,

783
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,460
you were confused and afraid.

784
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
But you never said

785
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
Fan Yue is Zitong's young lady.

786
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Qi Feng,

787
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,460
you really hate Fan Yue.
