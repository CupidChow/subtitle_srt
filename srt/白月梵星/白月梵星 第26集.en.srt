1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 26]

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,220
What do you want to tell me, Grandfather?

20
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,829
A truth.

21
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
It's the truth that you guys have been wanting to know,

22
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,820
which is regarding the boy with purple eyes.

23
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,080
25 years ago,

24
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,280
A child with

25
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,370
purple eyes was born in Bai Ze Clan.

26
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,700
Just wait, don't fret.

27
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,320
Congratulations to the Chief

28
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,180
on welcoming two grandchildren.

29
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,220
Congratulations to the Chief on welcoming two grandchildren!

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,730
Congratulations.

31
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,250
These purple eyes are from the heaven,

32
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,850
so he must be extraordinary.

33
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,480
From then on,

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
I knew

35
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,910
my grandson

36
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,350
doesn't belong to me anymore.

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,570
In the first few decades,

38
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,410
besides a pair of purple eyes,

39
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,660
Yue was no different

40
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,730
from others.

41
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,000
I told myself,

42
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,230
maybe I was wrong.

43
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,080
Maybe Yue

44
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,380
just happened to have a pair of purple eyes.

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,020
Afterwards, Yue and Qi Feng

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,060
took it upon themselves to switch their eye colors.

47
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,270
I was worried something might happen,

48
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,410
but I didn't give them a hard time.

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,079
Yue!

50
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,839
One year later,

51
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,820
when Yue went up to the mountain to collect some herbs,

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,700
he fell off the cliff.

53
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,690
Yue!

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,820
Yue!

55
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,420
Yue.

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
Yue.

57
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,190
Yue?

58
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,050
I'm Grandfather.

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,370
The inevitable

60
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,159
has arrived.

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,200
What does the

62
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,630
purple forehead mark mean?

63
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,940
That's the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,240
That year when he fell off the cliff,

65
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,140
Yue

66
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,700
the Demon Lord

67
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,910
finally possessed his body.

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
You mean

69
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,620
Fan Yue is the Demon Lord?

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
Wasn't the Divine Race wiped out a long time ago?

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
How could the Demon Lord descend into Fan Yue's body?

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,170
How could we ever know

73
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,700
the full story of what happened to the Divine Race?

74
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,000
But no matter

75
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,090
what the reason was,

76
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,650
the Demon Lord

77
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,390
is deeply indebted

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
to the Bai Ze Clan.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,410
Our clan's mission

80
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,490
is to protect the Demon Lord.

81
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,680
Master, you want to force your way into Bai Shuo's sea of consciousness?

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,240
These past few days,

83
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,170
I've been wondering why she remained unharmed when absorbing Contemplations previously,

84
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,830
but hasn't woken up this time.

85
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,740
I think it’s related to the spiritual soul of Bai Ze Clan.

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,140
Bai Ze's spiritual soul?

87
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,700
In ancient times,

88
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,300
the ancestors of Bai Ze Clan

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,140
were protected by Demon Lord Jing Yuan.

90
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,960
They were even bestowed a sliver of divine power by the Demon Lord.

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,570
Although tens of thousands of years have passed

92
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,750
and the Bai Ze Clan's divine power may no longer be apparent,

93
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,060
the spiritual energy and soul in their blood

94
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,020
remain stronger than those of ordinary demons.

95
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,470
Otherwise, their spiritual soul would not have remained intact for years,

96
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,670
leaving the Stone Clan no choice

97
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,680
but to suppress them via a formation.

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,270
Are you trying to say that

99
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,010
the spiritual soul of the Bai Ze Clan

100
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,890
is now

101
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,530
in Bai Shuo's sea of consciousness,

102
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,040
suppressing her willpower

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,700
and causing her to not wake up?

104
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,280
That's why I have to enter her sea of consciousness

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
in order to wake her up.

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,320
No, Master.

107
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,520
It's too dangerous.

108
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,810
One's spiritual consciousness is the weakest thing in the world.

109
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,130
Once your spiritual consciousness dissipates, it means death.

110
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,390
Even with your demonic power,

111
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,750
it's not safe to enter someone else's sea of consciousness by force.

112
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,950
If anything goes wrong,

113
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,680
your spiritual soul will be swallowed

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,110
and you will never wake up again.

115
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,580
That's why we can't wait any longer.

116
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,020
But...

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
I am from the Bai Ze Clan.

118
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,610
Shuo is the one I love.

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
This time, I must go.

120
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,190
I know I can't stop you.

121
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,250
It is most dangerous when

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,909
your spiritual consciousness leaves the body.

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,320
I'll protect you from outside the room.

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,810
♫The person standing far away♫

125
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,620
♫Don't be afraid♫

126

127

Shuo.

128
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,409
Wait for me.

129
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,220
♫Walk towards me♫

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,020
♫My heart feels so...♫

131
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,400
♫It's pounding♫

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,730
So when the Tiger Clan came to ask for the boy with purple eyes,

133
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,730
you sacrificed Qi Feng

134
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,800
in order to protect Demon Lord Fan Yue?

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,550
I had let Qi Feng down.

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,810
But if

137
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,320
I had to do it all over again,

138
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,610
I...

139
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,520
will still make the same choice.

140
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,940
This is both Qi Feng

141
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,890
and Bai Ze's destiny.

142
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,590
When I first entered this valley,

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,410
I found it rather strange.

144
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,000
Since the resentment of Bai Ze has been resolved,

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
why is the valley

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,919
still shrouded in such thick fog,

147
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,809
never seeing the light of the day?

148
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,390
Now, it seems that

149
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,360
the fog is probably caused by you, Grandfather.

150
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,000
It's because there's something you can't let go of in your heart

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,450
that is causing this lingering sorrow.

152
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't regret

153
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,570
what happened back then,

154
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,420
but I feel guilty.

155
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,700
I am the reason

156
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,810
the two brothers

157
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,790
ended up like this.

158
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,990
That day,

159
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,680
it was my choice

160
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,870
that changed their respective destinies,

161
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,480
forcing them to

162
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,530
walk down separate but difficult roads.

163
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,130
As the Chief of Bai Ze Clan,

164
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,790
I can't regret it.

165
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,900
But as their grandfather,

166
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,140
I feel guilty towards these two children.

167
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,050
Especially...

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,490
Qi Feng.

169
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,730
They were both born on the same day,

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
but because he doesn't have the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle,

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,920
he's destined

172
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,770
to be sacrificed.

173
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,040
If I were him,

174
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,670
I would also grow hateful too.

175
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,300
But Yue did nothing wrong.

176
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,000
The moment he was born,

177
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,920
he was bestowed

178
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,820
the destiny of the Demon Lord.

179
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,320
He too had no choice.

180
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,130
I hope that

181
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,000
they would hate me

182
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,460
instead of

183
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,950
hating each other.

184
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,790
If only Qi Feng could hear

185
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,750
what you just said, Grandfather.

186
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,370
Fan Yue?

187
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,040
Yue!

188
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,770
Grandfather.

189
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,060
I'll say it again.

190
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,250
Hand over the child with purple eyes!

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
Qi Feng,

192
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,430
you must remember.

193
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,950
Yue

194
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,810
was born extraordinary.

195
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,950
He is not only your brother,

196
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,860
he is someone

197
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,010
you have to protect with your life.

198
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,980
I can help you,

199
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,250
but I don't like

200
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
people who are weak.

201
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,420
If it takes blood

202
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,530
to soothe the hatred in your heart

203
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,620
and bring back the Qi Feng of the past,

204
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,880
once I finish what I need to do,

205
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,070
I'll give you

206
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,770
my life.

207
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,470
Although I didn't see the face of the mysterious man,

208
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,670
I saw a black snake mark

209
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,390
on his arm.

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,200
You've overestimated yourself.

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,820
You are lucky to even be alive,

212
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,350
yet you came seeking your death?

213
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,120
I know I can't beat you,

214
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,260
and I know I might die here.

215
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,310
But I must seek vengeance for

216
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,260
the extermination of my clan

217
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,310
and the death of my father!

218
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,910
Extermination of your clan?

219
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,950
Exactly who destroyed whose clan,

220
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,670
and who owes whose revenge?

221
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
My father might not be a good person,

222
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,860
but he is a good father.

223
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,230
As his daughter,

224
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,790
this is something I must do.

225
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,270
Why stay alive

226
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,580
if it hurts this much?

227
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,640
Forget it.

228
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,750
Someone doesn't want me to kill you.

229
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,750
I'll spare your life today.

230
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,800
[Qi Feng]

231
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,610
It’s all my fault.

232
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
If I hadn't left Bai Ze Clan back then,

233
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,450
I might have met Qi Feng when he came back

234
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,540
and stopped the Stone Clan from trespassing.

235
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,020
This way, Qi Feng wouldn't have been consumed by hatred,

236
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,880
and the people of our clan wouldn't be so resentful.

237
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,630
Don't take everything upon yourself.

238
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,610
Yue,

239
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,880
you've already been through enough

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,040
all these years.

241
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,170
Grandfather,

242
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,300
do you really think I'm Demon Lord?

243
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,690
But I don't have any relevant memories.

244
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,000
Sometimes,

245
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,280
that's just how destiny unfolds itself.

246
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,440
It happens when you least expect it.

247
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,580
When it hits,

248
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,490
if there's no way of avoiding it,

249
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,920
you have to face it head on.

250
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,610
Grandfather,

251
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,070
you seem to have something else in mind.

252
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,890
This is exactly why

253
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,040
why I had to connect with you.

254
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,920
The Bai Ze Clan,

255
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,820
descended from ancient divine beasts,

256
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,420
gathers the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into their very being.

257
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,010
Every Chief

258
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,200
have the power of prophecy.

259
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,540
We can see

260
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,380
major events of the future.

261
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,690
Major events?

262
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,710
Not long ago,

263
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,900
I had a premonition.

264
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,480
The resurrection of the Hidden Lord

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,770
will cause a catastrophe in the world.

266
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,650
Resurrection of the Hidden Lord?

267
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,250
Like you,

268
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,610
there is someone destined

269
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,210
to become the Hidden Lord.

270
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,630
But...

271
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,710
I don't know who this person might be,

272
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,850
nor do I know

273
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,310
where he is.

274
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,790
The only thing

275
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,510
I am sure is that

276
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,070
once the Hidden Lord reappears,

277
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,680
the Eastern Continent will be destroyed.

278
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,250
What happened?

279
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,360
Don't panic.

280
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,270
Nothing happened.

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
It's just that...

282
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
the time has come.

283
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,450
Bai Ze's Hatred Contemplation

284
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,110
has been resolved.

285
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,960
This illusion

286
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,330
will naturally collapse.

287
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,590
My clansmen and I

288
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,630
should leave.

289
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,230
Grandfather.

290
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,980
Where are you going?

291
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,060
The Bai Ze Clan,

292
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,200
born of heaven and earth,

293
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,230
should of course return to the heaven and earth.

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,950
Yue,

295
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,980
there's no need to regret

296
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,010
or hold on to it.

297
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,690
You...

298
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,070
have your own destiny.

299
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,880
Don’t be trapped in the past.

300
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,640
The Bai Ze Clan

301
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,880
have one last present

302
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,190
for

303
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,450
Shuo.

304
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,280
The entire Bai Ze Clan's final spiritual powers

305
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,430
shall be given to you as our blessings.

306
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,610
Here's wishing you

307
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,470
a smooth acquisition of the Hatred Contemplation.

308
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,940
May you

309
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,160
never suffer in difficult times,

310
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,980
and may every danger

311
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,660
be turned into a path of ease.

Remember,

320
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,960
don't be trapped in the past.

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,530
♫You are my first and last♫

344
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,970
I'm afraid I won't be able to hug you in the very next moment.

345
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,860
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

346
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,670
This is the first time I've ever heard you speak words of affection.

347
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,460
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

348
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,280
How about...

349
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,760
you say it again?

350
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,840
♫Let's never let go♫

351
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,070
I'm not joking with you.

352
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,780
Neither am I.

353
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,970
All this talk of the Demon Lord and Demon King...

354
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,860
Sometimes I just wish I could leave it all behind

355
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,320
and live secluded in the mountains with you,

356
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,120
where we live freely with ease.

357
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,190
The Divine Mantle of the Demon Lord

358
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,380
is set by heaven.

359
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,350
But it's up to you

360
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,230
to decide who you want to be.

361
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,160
What?

362
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,210
Do you really want to live in seclusion with me?

363
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,280
I just hope that

364
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,930
you won't be caught up in the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

365
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,330
If the world is peaceful,

366
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,190
what's wrong with living in seclusion?

367
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,350
But if what Grandfather said is true,

368
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,880
where the resurrection of the Hidden Lord

369
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,010
will cause a catastrophe in the world,

370
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,920
where else can we hide?

371
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,600
Fan Yue.

372
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,090
Promise me.

373
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,030
No matter

374
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,790
what turmoil may come in the future,

375
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,400
we shall face it together.

376
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,370
Okay?

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,100
Master.

378
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,020
Come in.

379
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,750
What is it?

380
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,910
Chen Ye is missing.

381
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,180
Greetings, Master.

382
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,610
I’m useless.

383
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,180
The plan with the Stone Clan failed,

384
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,040
and I did not manage to kill Fan Yue

385
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,470
or bring Bai Shuo and the Contemplation Stone back for you.

386
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,780
Please punish me.

387
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,060
The matter of the Stone Clan has been settled for a few days.

388
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,700
Since you were injured,

389
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,700
why didn't you come back until today?

390
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,860
I was captured by Fan Yue and brought back to the Bright Moon Palace.

391
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,850
I only had a chance to escape from Bright Moon Palace today.

392
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,890
Once I was free,

393
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,850
I came back to see you immediately.

394
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,910
He didn't kill you,

395
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,780
but just captured you alive?

396
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,230
Fan Yue harbors sinister intentions.

397
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,310
He wanted to

398
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,330
find out more about your technique's weaknesses

399
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,400
and the deployment of guards in Cold Spring Palace from me.

400
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,360
How could I ever betray you?

401
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,280
Although I didn't kill Fan Yue,

402
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,840
I killed Cang Shan instead.

403
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,390
The wounds on my body

404
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,650
were inflicted by Fan Yue in his rage.

405
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,200
You killed Cang Shan?

406
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,440
Yes.

407
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,420
Great.

408
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,510
It's just a failure.

409
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,710
You don't have to worry about it.

410
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,080
By killing Cang Shan,

411
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,900
you've managed to help me

412
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,340
get rid of Fan Yue's right-hand man.

413
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,310
You deserve credit.

414
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,980
Come.

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,770
Get up.

416
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,350
I'll make them pay

417
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,130
for the harm

418
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,570
you've suffered.

419
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,250
Thank you, Master.

420
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,310
Idiot.

421
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,250
Do you really think I can't tell

422
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,090
that you're not hurt at all?

423
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,090
I just wanted to see

424
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,040
what you are trying to do.

425
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,980
But Chen Ye,

426
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,930
I was the one who saved your life,

427
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,430
raised you,

428
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,210
and taught you demonic magic.

429
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,540
I'm very curious as to

430
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,610
why you would want to kill me.

431
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,500
Back then, it was you who got Tiger Clan to kill Bai Ze.

432
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,400
It was you who wanted to find the boy with purple eyes.

433
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,560
How did you know?

434
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,310
The man who gave Tiger King the order to kill Bai Ze

435
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,550
had a black snake mark on his arm.

436
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
It seems

437
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,700
there are still remnants of the Tiger Clan

438
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,800
left in this world.

439
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
That's right.

440
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,220
I was the one who

441
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,290
gave the order to kill Bai Ze

442
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,350
back in the past.

443
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,860
So what?

444
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,320
If it weren't for me,

445
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,540
how could you get to where you are today?

446
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,740
What's wrong with

447
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,660
being second to only one

448
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,640
while being above everyone else

449
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,370
here in Cold Spring Palace?

450
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,610
Are those cheap lives

451
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,970
from Bai Ze Clan

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,630
deserving of you to disobey me?

453
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,210
Their lives are not cheap!

454
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,420
Back then, you brought me back from Bai Ze Clan

455
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,210
and raised me.

456
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,280
All these years, you didn't kill me.

457
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,960
That means you can't kill me.

458
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,970
But one day,

459
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,670
I'll be able to kill you.

460
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,490
Everything you have now

461
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,250
was given to you by me.

462
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,530
Do you really think

463
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,910
you can kill me...

464
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,220
Impressive.

465
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,630
You actually put poison

466
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,440
into the power I gave you.

467
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,050
Such ruthlessness,

468
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,290
you truly

469
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,900
are my disciple.

470
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,770
But don't forget,

471
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,950
I'm your master after all.

472
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,230
Your poison

473
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,460
can't hurt me.

474
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,300
Kill me.

475
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,120
Killing you would be too easy.

476
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,870
I...

477
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,610
suddenly want to clarify something.

478
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,060
Since you know

479
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,690
I’m the one who killed Bai Ze,

480
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,000
why didn't you

481
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,500
want to join hands with me to kill Fan Yue,

482
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,790
but instead came back to seek your death?

483
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,300
Given Fan Yue's character,

484
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,810
how could he have

485
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,420
spared your life

486
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,900
when you killed Cang Shan?

487
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,860
Nuo.

488
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,250
Why are you in the secret chamber?

489
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,180
Where is Chen Ye?

490
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,610
You were the one who opened the secret chamber.

491
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,250
You were trying to kill him for revenge, right?

492
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,080
He killed my father and my clan.

493
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,790
Your father and your clansmen

494
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,330
also have the blood of other tribes on their hands.

495
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,560
The people they've killed also have their own loved ones.

496
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,410
What's the point of your father saving you

497
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,670
if you only know how to stop killing with even more killing?

498
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,470
Chen Ye has escaped from Bright Moon Palace.

499
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,570
It seems he went back to the Cold Spring Palace.

500
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,030
It looks like he still wouldn't turn around.

501
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
He still chose to be loyal to Zhen Yu.

502
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,750
It's the path he chose for himself.

503
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,640
You've done a great job.

504
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,070
What's wrong?

505
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,390
He...

506
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,480
broke into your sea of consciousness by force.

507
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,810
I’m afraid he had hurt his spiritual soul.

508
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,800
Bai Ze Clan,

509
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,620
purple-eyed boy,

510
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,570
the Human Race,

511
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,980
Ning'an City,

512
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,220
and the Bai family.

513
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,090
The Old Turtle predicted that

514
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,020
one of the child is from Bai Ze Clan,

515
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,590
and the other is from the Human Race.

516
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,190
So, I brought back Qi Feng and Bai Xi.

517
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,120
One was born with purple eyes,

518
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,510
and the other was born with innate spiritual energy.

519
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,240
They absorbed the Contemplation Stone

520
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,360
and acquired the Outlander King's Sword.

521
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,660
Bai Shuo is the child I was looking for.

522
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,250
Since Fu Ling was mistakenly identified,

523
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,920
could it be that Chen Ye,

524
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,690
who has been by my side all these years

525
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,030
without showing even a trace of divine energy,

526
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,890
is also the wrong one?

527
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,320
But he has purple eyes.

528
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,680
What's the relationship between Fan Yue and Chen Ye?

529
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,840
Why did he spare Chen Ye?

530
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,310
Could there be some connection between Fan Yue and the Bai Ze Clan?

531
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,350
Could it be that he is...

532
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,680
These are calming pills;

533
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,730
take them all.

534
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,320
Don't be so tense.

535
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,580
I just lost a bit of my spiritual soul.

536
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,350
I'll be fine after some rest and recovery.

537
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,590
The Demon Lord's divine power is boundless,

538
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,720
and they live as long as the heavens;

539
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,180
I shouldn't have worried.

540
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,430
Are you angry?

541
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,850
You know that venturing into the sea of consciousness would damage the spiritual soul,

542
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,420
so why did you still do it?

543
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,800
It's like you're worried about me.

544
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,960
I can't stand by and watch you get hurt either.

545
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,280
Don't talk about losing my spiritual soul,

546
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,360
even if it's...

547
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,330
Don't say anything ominous.

548
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you worried about something

549
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,160
because of my Demon Lord's Divine Mantle?

550
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,940
Shuo.

551
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,100
I'm still Fan Yue,

552
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,190
and nothing will change that.

553
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,390
But the deity is really too far away from me.

554
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,790
I'm afraid that

555
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,290
♫Writing wishes in the night sky♫

556
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,170
one day, whether you want to or not,

557
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,750
you will become that Demon Lord, Jing Yuan, again.

558
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,880
♫The clouds seal their approval for me♫

559
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,440
I am Fan Yue,

560
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,780
and no one can change that,

561
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,150
♫You walk towards me slowly♫

562
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,670
not even myself.

563
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,960
♫Time stops♫

564
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,310
Don't be afraid.

565
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,970
No matter what the future is,

566
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,520
♫The brightest star in the night sky♫

567
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,160
I'm by your side.

568
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,800
♫Is willing to extinguish for you♫

569
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,810
Can you stop being angry?

570
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,650
♫Because the starlight in your eyes♫

571
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,940
Who said I'm not angry?

572
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,190
Take the pills.

573
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,910
♫Lights up my long night♫

574
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,910
As long as your spiritual soul hasn't recovered,

575
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,770
you're not allowed to leave the Bright Moon Palace.

576
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,360
♫I'm afraid tomorrow is too far♫

577
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,710
♫Love you at every moment♫

578
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,850
♫Don't miss me♫

579
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,070
♫I'll always be by your side♫

580
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,120
How is Master Fan?

581
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
He should be fine.

582
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,890
I just gave him the pills.

583
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,290
No matter whose divine mantle is on him,

584
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,060
in my heart, he is Fan Yue,

585
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,150
the only one I pledge loyalty to.

586
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,150
You hear

587
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,320
what I said to Fan Yue just now?

588
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,230
By the way,

589
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,920
I haven't had the chance to tell you since we returned.

590
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,750
Master Fan asked me to look into Bai Xi's whereabouts.

591
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,630
I found out that

592
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,580
the Taoist who took her from the Bai family 10 years ago

593
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,780
is most likely from Cold Spring Palace.

594
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,000
I saw Xi

595
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,810
in Chen Ye's memories as well.

596
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,670
Zhen Yu took Chen Ye away from the Bai Ze Clan

597
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,250
because he thought he had the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

598
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,420
But Bai Xi is just from Human Race;

599
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,190
why would he go to such lengths to take her away?

600
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,360
Don't be impulsive.

601
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,050
All we know now is that

602
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,030
Bai Xi was once in Cold Spring Palace.

603
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,230
But all these years,

604
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,430
I've never heard of anyone like her

605
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,850
in the Cold Spring Palace.

606
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,400
Zhen Yu must have hidden her away.

607
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,800
If we rush over, we won't be able to find her.

608
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,210
Let's wait

609
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,970
until Master Fan recovers before we do anything.

610
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,700
[Qi Feng]

611
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,890
I didn't expect that the mighty Lord Chen Ye

612
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,040
would have such a humiliating moment.

613
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,870
I never thought

614
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,570
the only one who would come to see me in the Cold Spring Palace would be you.

615
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,570
What?

616
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,740
Are you here to laugh at me?

617
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,020
I'm not here to laugh at you.

618
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,680
After all, who hasn't been here before?

619
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,380
I'm just curious.

620
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,720
You, who always avoids danger

621
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,790
and is so loyal to him,

622
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,210
why would you want to kill him and seek death?

623
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,060
Don't you want him to die?

624
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,450
You just don't dare to do it.

625
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,530
So what if I want?

626
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,400
My life is in his hands.

627
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,580
Whether I betray him or not,

628
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,510
what difference does it make to me?

629
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,850
There are some things

630
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,280
that are more important than life.

631
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,310
The one who instructed the Tiger Clan to kill Bai Ze back then

632
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,850
was Zhen Yu.

633
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,300
Did you kill Master

634
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,810
for revenge?

635
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,840
Why did he do that?

636
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,900
I don't know.

637
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,240
All I know is that

638
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,660
he brought me back

639
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,170
because of my purple eyes.

640
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,920
Purple eyes?

641
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,730
Why haven't I seen them before?

642
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,730
That's because Grandfather used sorcery

643
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,410
to hide my purple eyes.

644
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,580
Only Zhen Yu can see it.

645
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,170
Why is Xi in your memory?

646
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
Why is she in Cold Spring Palace?

647
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,350
What Xi?

648
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,810
The girl who was with you in the hall

649
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,430
when you received your name from Zhen Yu.

650
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,350
Where is she?

651
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,700
Fu Ling,

652
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
do you still remember your origins?

653
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,940
What are you trying to say?

654
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,490
Zhen Yu is unpredictable

655
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,930
and full of schemes.

656
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,640
Since he took me as his disciple

657
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,330
because of my purple eyes,

658
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,740
what about you?

659
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,930
There are countless demons,

660
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,700
and you're neither the most talented

661
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,030
nor the strongest.

662
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,850
Why did he take you in

663
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,200
and keep you by his side?

664
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,440
Aren't you curious

665
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,500
who you were

666
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,380
before you became Fu Ling?

667
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,860
I'm not as curious as you.

668
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,870
Sometimes,

669
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,170
the more a man knows,

670
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,810
the faster he will die.

671
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,700
Just like you.

672
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,870
True.

673
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,920
You didn't come here

674
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,680
just to ask me why I want to kill Zhen Yu, did you?

675
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,680
Do you have the antidote

676
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,340
for the Heart Devouring Pill?

677
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,170
No.

678
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,580
But I know where the antidote is.

679
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,010
There's a hidden drawer in the cabinet on the east side of Zhen Yu's room.

680
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,430
The antidote is in it.

681
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,060
Are you really willing to tell me?

682
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,240
I guess it's because you're like me –

683
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,890
pitiful,

684
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,240
ridiculous,

685
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,090
despicable,

686
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,500
and pathetic.

687
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,550
You and I fight and struggle here in Cold Spring Palace,

688
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,960
and we're each other's most hated enemies,

689
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,280
but in the end,

690
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,150
we're also each other's only companions.

691
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,210
Whether you believe it or not,

692
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,350
I've never once thought about truly taking your life.

693
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,969
Fu Ling,

694
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,810
just live

695
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,800
if you can.

696
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,880
What's wrong with you?

697
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,290
I want to get more power as quickly as possible,

698
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,489
but suddenly my chest

699
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,820
feels a little tight.

700
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,560
Now that the Four Contemplations are in your body

701
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,250
and you've gained Bai Ze's spiritual power;

702
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,190
these powers can help you become stronger,

703
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,790
but you also need to find a way

704
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,660
to cultivate them for your own use.

705
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
Cultivate them?

706
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,510
What is this place?

707
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,370
After I was injured and left the Bai Ze Clan,

708
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,120
I traveled everywhere to practice Demon Race techniques,

709
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,050
all while thinking about revenge.

710
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,960
Perhaps it was heaven's blessing

711
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,340
that I accidentally stumbled upon this cave.

712
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,850
Inside, there were many secret techniques.

713
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,000
After cultivating them, my demonic power grew rapidly,

714
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,970
and within three years, I had conquered the Eastern Continent.

715
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,400
There's nothing in this cave.

716
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,060
How could there be secret techniques

717
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,530
that could increase your demonic power so quickly

718
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,990
and help you conquer the Eastern Continent?

719
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,510
Why isn't there any reaction when I touch the cave wall?

720
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,590
Could it be that only you

721
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,050
can make these images appear and disappear?

722
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,170
I've always wondered.

723
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,200
Maybe

724
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,960
the only explanation I can think of

725
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,390
is that I have the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

726
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,280
This cave

727
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,490
might be related to the Divine Race.

728
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,680
The Divine Race?

729
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,780
Back then, I cultivated haphazardly

730
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,750
and accidentally created the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal,

731
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,880
but I could never find a way to break it.

732
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,850
Later, I saved Old Turtle,

733
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,770
and from his divination, I learned that

734
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,000
only the power of the Contemplation Stone

735
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,580
could break the Seven Stars backlash.

736
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,320
But the Contemplation Stone is a divine object,

737
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,350
and no one knows its exact use.

738
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,790
I only learned about the Contemplation Stone

739
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,170
from these murals.

740
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,450
What are you thinking?

741
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,500
Nothing.

742
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,780
I just feel like

743
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,790
someone was secretly guiding you.

744
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,560
First, he led you to this cave

745
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,270
to cultivate the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal,

746
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,850
then he arranged for you to search for the Contemplation Stone.

747
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,320
What kind of mission

748
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,960
does the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle carry on?

749
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,420
Maybe when the time comes,

750
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,520
everything will have an answer.

751
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,190
What's wrong?

752
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,340
I don't know.

753
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,380
It's hard to explain.

754
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,970
You have the Demon Lord's Divine Mantle,

755
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,270
so naturally, you are destined for greatness.

756
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,860
♫The white-haired elder lives in peaceful seclusion in the mountains♫

757
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,550
But I've thought it through;

758
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,860
no one can stop us from being together.

759
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:51,490
♫The misty mountains, with rain washing away the dust♫

760
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,890
Even if you are a deity,

761
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,680
even if the deity has eternal life

762
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,490
and omnipotent powers,

763
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,970
♫A peaceful detachment, neither hearing nor asking♫

764
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,140
so what?

765
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,000
I will still hone my skills

766
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,350
and make everyone know that

767
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,730
I, Bai Shuo,

768
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:04,910
♫No one needs to take these vain words seriously♫

769
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,830
am worthy to stand shoulder to shoulder with the deity.

770
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,550
How arrogant.

771
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,430
♫I've climbed 3,000 steps with a sincere heart♫

772

773
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,640
Bai Shuo from Ning'an City

774

♫I've prayed to the Buddha, burning incense, keeping to oneself♫

775
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,310
is arrogant, conceited,

776
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,490
and reckless.

777
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,900
♫Don't ask, don't separate, don't describe the universe anymore♫

Everyone says the deity is powerful,

779
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,450
but I will claim you as my own.

780
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,690
♫I only deserve to read poetry intoxicatingly♫

♫I've climbed 3,000 steps with a sincere heart♫

787
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,700

788

♫I've prayed to the Buddha, burning incense, keeping to oneself♫

790
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,020
then slowly disperse it,

♫Don't ask, don't separate, don't describe the universe anymore♫

♫I only deserve to read poetry intoxicatingly♫

Remember,

796

you must focus all your energy,

♫I am an average person who fell into the mundane world♫

802
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,490
There are countless demons,

803
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,420
and you're neither the most talented

804
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,840
nor the strongest.

805
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,420
Why did he take you in

806
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,550
and keep you by his side?

807
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,950
Aren't you curious about

808
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,910
who you were

809
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,100
before becoming Fu Ling?

810
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,160
Zhen Yu had already disregarded the fate of immortals and demons when he was in the Outlanders' City.

811
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,490
What is the conspiracy he is now scheming?

812
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,370
Master.

813
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,290
What?

814
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,890
Are you also

815
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,080
going to betray me?

816
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,180
I have never coveted the secret treasure.

817
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,970
I was just

818
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,260
momentarily confused

819
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,870
and wanted to cure the Heart Devouring poison.

820
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,140
Everything I have given you,

821
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,080
all the blessings and hardships,

822
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,210
are the my grace.

823
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,760
Since when have you

824
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,950
begun to

825
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,490
go against my wishes?

826
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,430
I dare not.

827
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
You dare not?

828
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,930
Didn't you

829
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,220
meet with Chen Ye

830
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,600
last night?

831
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,970
I want to know

832
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,590
do I still have family

833
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,850
in this world?

834
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,180
And before becoming Fu Ling,

835
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,640
who was I?

836
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,330
You want to know

837
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,550
who you are?

838
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,960
Fu Ling,

839
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,200
it's been 10 years

840
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,300
since I

841
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,520
brought you back to Cold Spring Palace.

842
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,550
We've been master and disciple

843
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,350
for 10 years.

844
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,160
I once taught you that

845
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,280
people should look forward.

846
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,100
Thinking too much

847
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,000
will only

848
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,780
make you die faster.

849
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,410
Young Lord, watch out!

850
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,970
Xixi!

851
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,910
Young Lord, run!

852
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,320
Let her go!

853
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,380
Master.

854
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,330
I'm begging you

855
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,220
to let Xixi go.

856
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,020
Young Lord!

857
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,550
Xixi.

858
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,530
Young Lord.

859
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,980
No!

860
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,060
Xixi!

861
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,270
Come chase after me!

862
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,100
This fabric looks great for making clothes.

863
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,270
I think this would make a great cape.

864
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,550
Yes, it's very beautiful.

865
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,220
-Aren't I fast?
-Yes.

866
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,550
Go faster!

867
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,730
Okay.

868
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,020
Your handwriting is terrible.

869
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:25,230
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

870
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,780
Your handwriting is terrible.

871
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,550
Didn't you say

872
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,190
you would wait for Xi to come back with me?

873
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,840
We still haven't waited for her yet.

874
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,020
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

875
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,340
You can't die!

876
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:44,080
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

877
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,480
Father.

878
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,080
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

879
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,480
I'm.

880
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,690
I am...

881
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm not.

882
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,510
No.

883
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,830
I'm not.

884
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,210
No, you are.

885
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,390
I'm not.

886
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,530
No.

887
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,380
Since you've already remembered,

888
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,190
why deny it?

889
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,410
Am I right?

890
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,000
My good disciple.

891
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,690
Bai Xi.

892
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,500
♫Across thousands of miles♫

893
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,150
It was I who sent someone

894
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,010
to take you away from Ning'an City back then,

895
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,100
and it was I

896
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,650
who erased your memories,

897
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:22,550
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

898
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,930
turning you from a human

899
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,260
into a demon.

900
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,760
Bai Xun was killed by your own hands.

901
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,140
You were involved

902
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,450
in all of Bai Shuo's

903
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,370
suffering.

904
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,710
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

905
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,410
I'm not Bai Xi.

906
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,540
I'm not!

907
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,230
Since you're in so much pain,

908
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,420
why not let me help you put an end to it?

909
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,650
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

910
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,500
After all,

911
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,070
the one I've truly been looking for

912
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,580
was never you.
