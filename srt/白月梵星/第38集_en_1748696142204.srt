12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
I am willing to be like a star, and the army is like a moon.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,160
The world is here, and we are here.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
I only want to be with the one I love, and to see every star.

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
I want to be with you forever.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,160
The first demon is the master, and you and him are not the same person.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Since you help my grandma, they are no� Sparkling.

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
My father gave birth to four shots of ψ.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
The only person left to go is the dog.

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,920

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,020

황

23
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,800
With a moment,

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,040
we will live all we want.

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
The first time I saw you, I was so happy.

26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
I was so happy.

27
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
I was so happy.

28
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,460
I was so happy.

29
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
I was so happy.

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
I was so happy.

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
I was so happy.

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:16,080
A

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
can become live,

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
won others over

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,240
and kill others,

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,680
to die with.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
Don't...

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,080
actually it seems all of you shied away finally

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,140
this was risky

40
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,480
think of your success

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,560
it was a simple strategy

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,220
that really led to a bedroom

43
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,520
and after I became a woman

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm here.

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
They all said that there's no god in the world.

46
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
But I didn't expect that

47
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
the Three Gods of Shanggu and the main gods of the gods

48
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
would exist in the world.

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
The Demon God suddenly came back.

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
It seems that everything has its own source.

51
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
There's no absolute...

52
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Yes.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
We were so eager to get rid of Bai Shu.

54
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,520
But today, Bai Shu saved everyone's life.

55
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
What I didn't expect is that

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
the child we raised ourselves, Chong Zhao,

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
is now in the shadow of the gods.

58
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Although the shadow of the gods is not the main cause,

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
it's still the same as Chong Zhao who was taken away by the gods.

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,520
If the shadow of the gods is really the cause,

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
the Immortal Sect will be in danger.

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
The Immortal Sect will be in danger.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Four gods,

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
are we going to do this to take the blame?

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Immortal Sect is a household business.

66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
We can't just talk about this.

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,520
If Chong Zhao really becomes the shadow of the gods,

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
then we will kill the Immortal Sect

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
with the power of the whole tribe.

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
You're right.

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
It's the Immortal Sect.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
How can we kill them?

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
If you're afraid of dying,

74
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
you can find a way to hide.

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Immortal Jin Lei is now being criticized.

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
But the Immortal Sect hasn't given you an explanation

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
about the Jin Yao.

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
That's right.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Jin Yao is the leader of the Jin Yao.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
But she's a disciple of the Immortal Sect

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
who has been harmed by the Immortal Sect.

82
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
You must give an explanation.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
Otherwise,

84
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,520
how can we take the position of the Immortal Sect?

85
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
You...

86
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
The leader is guilty of Jin Yao.

87
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
I will investigate it myself.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,520
But the responsibility for you at this moment

89
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
is to make the Immortal Sect proud

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
or to take the position of the Immortal Sect?

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You're not qualified to be the leader of the Jin Yao.

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
You shouldn't be responsible for Jin Yao's crime.

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,520
I will not give you any responsibility.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
But don't forget.

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Once, the Demon Clan's army entered the palace.

96
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Immortal Sect was in a state of disdain.

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Who is it?

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
He took the disciple of the Immortal Sect

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
and killed the leader of the Jin Yao

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
to take the position and prestige of the Demon Clan

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
in front of the Immortal Sect.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Lan Ling has the ability to use his skills,

103
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
but he can't do it without his skills.

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,520
He's better than those who can't even fight.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
You...

106
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Immortal Jin Lei,

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
do you think Lan Ling can be a martial artist?

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Do you want her to dance?

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll let you do it.

110
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Is that enough?

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Do you think you can do it?

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Enough.

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
If you really want to pursue your crime,

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
then you must do it.

115
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
It's hard for everyone to do it.

116
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
In recent years,

117
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
we've been in a good mood

118
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
for 72 Immortal Sects.

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
But what's really important is that

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
we still seek our own treasure.

121
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Every time, Lan Ling is in front of us.

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,520
If it weren't for the different sects,

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
we would have only chosen ourselves.

124
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
How could we give Jin Yao

125
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
the chance to be a hero?

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Yes.

127
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Pei Chen,

128
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
who taught you this?

129
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
You're not respected.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm bold.

131
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
But I'm also a stubborn man.

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm right.

133
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Nan Wan.

134
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
If you want to punish me,

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I can't.

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
But I must say something.

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Immortal Sects are powerful.

138
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm a householder.

139
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
But I don't know when it will start.

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Every Immortal Sect has its own power.

141
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
It's all in its own hands.

142
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
It's not easy to get rid of it.

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm afraid to ask.

144
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Are you still the Immortal Sects

145
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
that you're most proud of?

146
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
What do you know?

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Shut up!

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
We knew that

149
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
from what we saw,

150
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
when I and Wei Huo Ni An City

151
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
were sent to us by Lan Ling to fight against the Communist Party,

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,520
we all were in the battle.

153
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Later, we didn't know

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
that I and Zhu Xian Yao Zi Li Yu were in the same place.

155
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
We still dare not show up

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
and let me be the one to fight.

157
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
We're fighting for the victory.

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Now I'm taking my heart away

159
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,520
and taking back the money.

160
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Everyone,

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
as Immortal Sects,

162
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
do you really think it's just a family?

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Yes.

164
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
They're right.

165
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
If the 72 Immortal Sects

166
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
can be together in Tongzhou,

167
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
they won't hide their thoughts and go nowhere.

168
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,520
There won't be such a big scandal.

169
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Immortal Sects are a family.

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
When it comes to internal affairs,

171
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
it's a small matter.

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
The most important thing now

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
is to stop the Yin Zun from returning.

174
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Yes.

175
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
That's right.

176
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
That's right.

177
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You're awake.

179
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Zhen Yu,

180
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
what do you want?

181
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I want to do something.

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You knew it long ago, didn't you?

183
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
You knew I had the Yin Zun.

184
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
That's why you forced me to stay in the body

185
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
to get the Yin Li.

186
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
You did it to awaken Mo Li?

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
That's right.

188
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm not her.

189
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm Chong Zhao.

190
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm not that devil.

191
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
You're my Honorable Superior.

192
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,520
You just forgot who you are.

193
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Now that the Demon God has returned,

194
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
and has saved Bai Shuo's life,

195
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
you'll have to get rid of the Yin Zun.

196
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,520
It's not good to return to Honorable Superior.

197
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Yin Zun is dead.

198
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
It's impossible to get back Mo Li.

199
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Give up.

200
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Give up?

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,520
I've spent 60,000 years for this.

202
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I won't give up.

203
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,520
No one in this world can stop me

204
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
from returning to Honorable Superior.

205
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Chong Zhao!

206
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
A Xi!

207
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
You escaped from the cold spring

208
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,520
and came back to deliver the dead.

209
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
It's good.

210
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
The Yin Zun of ten years should be returned.

211
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Yin Zun?

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
You tricked me from Bai family

213
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
and took me to the hospital.

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
With my return to the city for ten years,

215
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
you dare to say Yin Zun?

216
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
No one can get away from my father's sin.

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I should die.

218
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
And you should be punished.

219
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,520
You should blame that old lady.

220
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Three children.

221
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
One is like your Bai family.

222
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
The other is like Bai Ze.

223
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
You were so angry.

224
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
To be honest, you were so ordinary.

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
I think everyone will think

226
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,520
you're the Star Moon God.

227
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
If it wasn't for the God of the Lord,

228
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I wouldn't have controlled you and Chen Ye.

229
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,520
I was waiting for you to return to the city

230
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
and then I would have to take you to the city.

231
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I was waiting for you to return to the city

232
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
and then I would have to take you away.

233
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I should have killed you

234
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
and returned you to the city.

235
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I was wrong.

236
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I was wrong.

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
But luckily,

238
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,520
everything is still in place.

239
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
How dare you hurt him?

240
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I'll kill you!

241
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Today, this place

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
doesn't need you to kill me.

243
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
I'll kill you!

244
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I will use my heart to fill the wild.

245
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
As long as I can win the Honorable Superior,

246
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
you know everything.

247
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
The Honorable Superior

248
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
The Honorable Superior

249
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
It's been 60,000 years.

250
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm finally back.

251
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,520
The Honorable Superior

252
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I will use your magic to destroy me.

253
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Destroy?

254
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm just a little snake.

255
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I've been thinking about the death of a snake in the south.

256
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,520
The Honorable Superior saved me.

257
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,520
My life is the Honorable Superior.

258
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
I can...

259
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I can change the Honorable Superior back.

260
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I don't regret it.

261
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Don't worry.

262
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
The one who killed you,

263
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
the one who let me down,

264
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
I will not let you down.

265
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
The things I haven't done in 60,000 years,

266
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,520
I should finish them now.

267
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,520
The Honorable Superior

268
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,520
You are the sister of the Star Moon.

269
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,520
The one who let me down.

270
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
The Honorable Superior

271
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
The world is moving.

272
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
The blade may not be real.

273
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
How could the discussing take so long to recover your image?

274
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
No disaster can avoid it.

275
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Since no escapees can be avoided,

276
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
second place only can Conversation.

277
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
please return immediately.

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Show proper vigilance to the people

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
must plan to heighten where to go.

281
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Your Majesty, rest assured.

282
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Even though the Soul-T kitchen is in chaos here,

283
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
there is a arrangement to步 forward before we do.

284
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
We'll go back here and wait for the order.

285
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Take care of this one.

286
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Yes, sir.

287
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,160
Can we really carry on this four-pronged festival?

288
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
The road ahead is unknown, but no matter what,

289
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
we must accept the last moment.

290
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
The day after tomorrow

291
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
He's back.

292
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
You're back.

293
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Xiyue.

294
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm back.

295
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Demon God, how are you?

296
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm back.

297
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Six thousand years ago, I've been in the Demon God's power to help the Immortal.

298
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Today, I've been in the Immortal's power to help the Immortal.

299
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,520
My power has returned to its original state.

300
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Where's Fan Yue?

301
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
She's the one you want to wake up to.

302
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Xiyue and Chongzhao are in danger.

303
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
It's too late.

304
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
The Immortal has returned.

305
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Even if you go back, Xiyue is still here.

306
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll go save her.

307
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
The Immortal has no power in the Demon God's power.

308
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
No one can defeat her.

309
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
The Immortal knows this very well.

310
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,520
So he hasn't been able to save His Highness.

311
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
But it's the same for the Immortal.

312
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Without Xiyue's power, he can't kill the Immortal.

313
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
He can't destroy the Immortal.

314
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
He can't save anyone.

315
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
He can't save anyone.

316
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Does that mean he's not going to be the Immortal?

317
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
You've met Xiyue.

318
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
You should know that

319
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
whether you want to save your sister,

320
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
to wake up Chongzhao,

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
or to keep this world,

322
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
you must find Xiyue first.

323
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
This is the only way.

324
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Don't worry too much.

325
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm here.

326
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
We faced each other 60,000 years ago.

327
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Now, we're the same.

328
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,520
The one you faced 60,000 years ago is Xiyue.

329
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
You're Xiyue.

330
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
But I'm Baishuang.

331
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Chongzhao?

332
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Love is true.

333
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Once you wake up,

334
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
you'll change your name.

335
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
You're not Chongzhao.

336
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
You can tell by your eyes.

337
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
It seems you really know him.

338
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Where is Chongzhao?

339
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
He's in the palace.

340
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
He's in the palace.

341
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Where is he?

342
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
How did you get him?

343
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
He's still there.

344
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
He's been suppressed by me

345
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
in the deepest part of the world.

346
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Let him go!

347
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
If I can't...

348
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Maybe you're not sure.

349
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,520
He was born for me.

350
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Now he's used it.

351
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
It's his glory.

352
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
And you...

353
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
If you don't want to get rid of me,

354
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
you'd better stay here.

355
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Why?

356
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Why didn't you kill me?

357
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
You're Xiyue's sister.

358
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
She'll be angry

359
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
if she kills you.

360
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Remember,

361
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I don't wash the dishes.

362
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Don't run.

363
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't make troubles.

364
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Be quiet.

365
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Don't be afraid.

366
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
60,000 years have passed.

367
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
The spirit of the immortal demon

368
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
has been so rich.

369
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Mo Li, what are you doing?

370
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Zhenyu has been waiting for me for 60,000 years.

371
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Shouldn't someone be buried for him?

372
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Xie Yao and Liang Zuo

373
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
will kill you in no time.

374
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
It seems you still don't understand

375
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
the power of the god.

376
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
The human clan is not only

377
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
the immortal demon

378
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
who has the skin and grass.

379
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
The immortal demon is also

380
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
the immortal demon

381
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
who is also the master of the dragon.

382
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Even if you don't have the power,

383
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
the immortal demon is back.

384
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
He won't let you

385
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
do anything you want.

386
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
The god of the jade is Ziyue.

387
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
The god of the star moon is Xing Chen.

388
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Do you know

389
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
why I am the god of the jade?

390
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
The god of the jade

391
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
looks like a monster.

392
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
The god of the jade is not just a big man.

393
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
It's like a dagger.

394
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
It's not a real thing.

395
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
The god of the jade

396
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
is the one who is responsible for the spell.

397
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
If we talk about the god of the jade,

398
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
there is another god

399
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
in the world.

400
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
It's the real god of the jade.

401
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I have the power of the world.

402
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
What else do I need?

403
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
As long as I have the power of the immortal demon,

404
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
no one can stop me.

405
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
The god of the jade

406
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
is the one who is responsible for the spell.

407
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

408
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

409
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

410
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

411
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

412
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

413
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

414
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

415
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

416
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

417
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
The god of the jade is the one who is responsible for the spell.

418
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,520
пользовuks

419
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Vocal

420
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,580
Stop!

421
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
You think that with God Almighty

422
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,300
to break the barrier to the master.

423
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,680
You have such power.

424
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,380
Why do you have to beg me for this?

425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,040
You trapped me here

426
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,340
because you can't kill me,

427
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,840
because I was the owner of this area.

428
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
And you're just a coward.

429
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,340
If you kill me, you'll die too.

430
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,840
It's too noisy.

431
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
You're so quiet.

432
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,800
Tian Huo.

433
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
You're finally back.

434
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,300
She...

435
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,800
I've heard about it.

436
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,300
Xiaoyao told me.

437
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
If you're not here,

438
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I'll tell you everything.

439
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll tell you everything.

440
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm so sorry.

441
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I found out something.

443
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I searched for the people,

444
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
the demons, the human and the people.

445
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I found the clue in the East Sea.

446
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
According to the ancient records of the East Sea,

447
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
when the god of the day was destroyed,

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
the sky was full of clouds and stars.

449
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
It scattered all over the East Sea.

450
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
East Sea?

451
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Clouds and stars?

452
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I remember you said

453
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
that the Wangjian was the first King of the Yi-Demons

454
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
who used the East Sea to search for the Clouds and Stars.

455
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
That's right.

456
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I went back to Yi City,

457
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
and I found the records of thousands of years ago.

458
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
I finally found the original shape of the Clouds and Stars.

459
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
It seems that the Star Moon Sword

460
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
was already broken when it was falling from the sky.

461
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
It lost its original shape.

462
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
It's no wonder that it was discovered by a person.

463
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
So the Wangjian is the Star Moon Sword?

464
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
What about the Star Moon God Palace?

465
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I haven't found it yet.

466
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Report!

467
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Something bad happened.

468
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
The Yin Sun is gone.

469
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
With the power of the God of the Day,

470
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
the Clouds and Stars are scattered all over the West Sea.

471
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
The Clouds and Stars are scattered all over the West Sea.

472
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
The Clouds and Stars are scattered all over the West Sea.

473
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,800
It's the first time that the four of you have come to the Cold Palace.

474
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Lan Ling said that he would protect the Cangsheng and get rid of the evil sect.

475
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
But the Cold Palace is a evil sect.

476
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
You have been so many years,

477
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
and you dare not attack.

478
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Instead, you let Chongzhao take the Demon's Manor.

479
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
It's ridiculous.

480
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
It's ridiculous.

481
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Lan Ling is a young disciple.

482
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
He is the Yin Sun.

483
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I told you.

484
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
If Chongzhao really becomes the Yin Sun,

485
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I will kill you even if I don't want to die.

486
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Kill me?

487
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Come in!

488
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Senior!

489
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I hate the most ungrateful guy.

490
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
You are so lucky.

491
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
You have the power to kill me.

492
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
If I can't kill you,

493
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
someone will kill you.

494
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
If you die,

495
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
you will be a total traitor.

496
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Chongzhao, wake up!

497
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Come in, Senior!

498
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Wake up!

499
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Senior!

500
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Wake up!

501
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I am not Chongzhao

502
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
who took your dream.

503
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
You killed us all.

504
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
You can't kill Xingyue and Jingyuan.

505
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
You are back in time.

506
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
This means the Heaven Island is in your control.

507
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Is that so?

508
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Without Xingyue's power,

509
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
they are not as dangerous as I am.

510
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I will let you see

511
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,800
how they pay the price for everything they have done.

512
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I will kill you.

513
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
You are so capable.

514
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
It seems that you are not easy.

515
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
I saved your life.

516
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
You want to kill me.

517
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Is that what you and Chongzhao are for?

518
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You are so stupid.

519
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
You can't mention him.

520
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
If I didn't have Chongzhao in this world,

521
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
you should thank me

522
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
for giving you the chance to meet him.

523
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Am I not right?

524
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You want to kill me?

525
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Kill me?

526
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Don't use Chongzhao's disgusting words.

527
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
He is different from you.

528
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
He is kind and righteous.

529
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
He is like you, who is a blood-sucking monster.

530
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
A blood-sucking monster?

531
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Lan Ling is just like me.

532
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Do you have less ancestors than me?

533
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Do you really think

534
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
you can use those blood-sucking pasts

535
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
to make a joke?

536
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
You are innocent.

537
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
You are a demon.

538
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Do you remember what you said to him

539
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,800
when you took Chongzhao back to the Cold Palace?

540
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
You said you were in hell and let him accompany you.

541
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Now you are in the hospital

542
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
and I can guarantee you

543
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
that you and Chongzhao will stay in hell forever.

544
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
You know everything about Chongzhao.

545
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
You know everything about Chongzhao.

546
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I know.

547
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
That's why I think he is useless.

548
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,800
He is righteous and righteous.

549
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
But he doesn't understand

550
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
that evil is the essence of the world.

551
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
You can kill me.

552
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
If you can succeed.

553
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
You are a demon.

554
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
You want to kill your people.

555
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Are you really so confident

556
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
or are you just a demon?

557
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
You are a demon.

558
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You are a demon.

559
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
You are a demon.

560
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
You are a demon.

561
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Are you really so confident

562
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
or are you just a demon?

563
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
What happened 60,000 years ago

564
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
is not just about the world.

565
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
It is about the world.

566
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You are the best marriage woman.

567
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Am I not?

568
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Are you going to destroy yourself

569
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
before you kill Mo Li?

570
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
I am just a minor injury.

571
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I can do it myself.

572
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I have been working with my dad.

573
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
We are 18 years old.

574
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I am not good at bowing.

575
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
I have never practiced it since I was a kid.

576
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I didn't expect that one day

577
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I would be able to fight with a god.

578
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
I just want to practice my sword skills

579
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
before I find the god.

580
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
The god of star and the god of star

581
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
are very different.

582
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
You know what I mean.

583
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
You know what I mean.

584
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You know what I mean.

585
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
You don't need to practice.

586
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Someone once told me

587
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
that it is not easy to be strong

588
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
when you want to be strong.

589
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Besides the spirit,

590
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
you need to practice hard.

591
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I am not that good.

592
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I am not good at dancing.

593
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
I can do it

594
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
if I want to.

595
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
You can practice,

596
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
but you will ruin yourself.

597
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Thank you.

598
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Why did you thank me?

599
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
It was ten years ago.

600
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Thank you for saving me and Xi.

601
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I have been searching for you for ten years

602
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
to repay you.

603
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
You don't need to thank me.

604
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
You are so funny.

605
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
I saved you that night.

606
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I didn't know you have the god of star and the god of star.

607
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
You are not the god of star.

608
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
You should be sober.

609
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
You have the same eyes as him.

610
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
But if I can recognize you that day,

611
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
maybe later...

612
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Actually I have a doubt.

613
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
The god of jade was broken six million years ago.

614
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
The god of jade fell.

615
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
But why did you still walk in the world ten million years ago?

616
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
My body has been gone for six million years.

617
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
But the three gods are not dead.

618
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I want to find the star.

619
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
So I have to think about my body.

620
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Half of it is white.

621
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
The other half is in the world.

622
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Until the half of the food in the food village is out of control.

623
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I have to find the god of star.

624
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
I went to his body.

625
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
But I have to find the god of star.

626
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
The god of star is strong.

627
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Lonely and lonely in the world.

628
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
You have been searching for him for six million years.

629
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Him?

630
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Why don't you say it's you?

631
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
You are him.

632
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Maybe you didn't find that

633
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
you just woke up.

634
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
You never changed my name.

635
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
You think it's unnecessary or you can avoid it?

636
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
You are a fool.

637
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
You didn't even think about it.

638
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Who am I now?

639
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
You are right.

640
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I can't come to myself before I get rid of the shadow.

641
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
I have to go back.

642
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I have to rest.

643
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I have to go back.

644
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
The god of star is in the mountain.

645
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
The green field is in the side.

646
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
The hundred thousand is in the rain.

647
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
It's for my justice.

648
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Fan Yuan.

649
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Do you want to marry me?

650
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
In the heaven and the earth.

651
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
In the earth and the earth.

652
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
One person is one.

653
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
You are not married.

654
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
You have my flower.

655
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
You are my person.

656
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Fine.

657
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Fan Yuan.

658
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
You have the same god.

659
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
The same body.

660
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
The same face.

661
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
But is he really you?

662
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
The god is back.

663
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
You should be happy.

664
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
What?

665
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Are you thinking about it?

666
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Should he be the god or the demon?

667
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
What about you?

668
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,800
The current god is just a memory of the demon.

669
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,800
He is stronger and more arrogant.

670
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
In my eyes, he is the god and the demon.

671
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
But the same god is different between me and you.

672
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I thought I could.

673
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
I could make him my Fan Yuan.

674
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
He is kind.

675
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
He can't tolerate it.

676
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I have the god of star.

677
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I have seen the star in the moon and the sea.

678
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
But I am the one who is the star.

679
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
I have never been with the jade.

680
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I have never been with the jade for a long time.

681
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I have never been with the jade.

682
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I have experienced the anger and anger.

683
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I have lived a life and a death.

684
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I have experienced everything.

685
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I have lived a life and a death.

686
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
It is Fan Yuan.

687
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
What are you going to do?

688
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
He is the demon.

689
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
But he is the god.

690
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't know.

691
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Tian Huo.

692
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Let me be alone, okay?

693
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,800
What do you feel about the star in the night sky?

694
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
The star is there.

695
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
It takes time.

696
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
It only takes people.

697
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
What you see is the stars.

698
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
But for me,

699
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
every star in the world

700
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,800
is the god of star.

701
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
What Uncle Bai said is true.

702
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
I am the god of star.

703
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Uncle Bai is right.

704
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I am really trying to escape.

705
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Because I really want to

706
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
treat him as a star.

707
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
So you finally admit that

708
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
you are a star.

709
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Actually, I know everything you and Uncle Bai are.

710
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Just like in the city of Yi.

711
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
You also know everything that Mu Mu and Uncle Bai are.

712
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Why did you mention Mu Mu again?

713
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I just think that the situation is similar.

714
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
It seems that you still don't like him.

715
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Do you like me?

716
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
You and I agree.

717
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I can feel it.

718
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
You also have feelings for me.

719
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Actually, of course.

720
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
If you are not here,

721
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
he doesn't have to make a choice.

722
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
But if you are not here,

723
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Uncle Bai may be dead.

724
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
My brother will not be back.

725
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
He will be in a panic.

726
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
You are not really annoying.

727
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I didn't try to be your enemy.

728
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
On the contrary, I want to thank you.

729
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Fan Yue, thank you for your existence.

730
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Thank you for protecting him all the way.

731
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I don't need you to take care of what I love.

732
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Yes.

733
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
You love Uncle Bai.

734
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I love Xing Yue.

735
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Only the one who meets the right time

736
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
can keep going.

737
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Once you make a mistake,

738
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
everything will be wrong.

739
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
I spent 60,000 years looking for Xing Yue.

740
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
But now I understand.

741
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Xing Yue is not here.

742
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
The Demon God is not

743
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
the necessary medicine to save time.

744
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Do you really think it through?

745
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I am satisfied

746
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
to see him again.

747
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Maybe my Su Xie

748
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
is for you who have been in power for 60,000 years.

749
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I will leave the power of the Demon God to you.

750
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Give Fan Yue back to Uncle Bai.

751
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
From now on, no matter how much the Demon God is,

752
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I will have the Demon God to protect me.

753
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Promise me to protect him well.

754
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Don't let me and Xing Yue's regret

755
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
fall on you and Uncle Bai again.

756
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I am so happy tonight.

757
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Xing Yue,

758
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I am here to see you.

759
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Uncle Bai.

760
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Don't be afraid.

761
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Xing Chen will only take you to me.

762
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Come on.

763
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Come on.

764
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,800
My heart is so excited.

765
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Zhuang.

766
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
You are back.

767
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
I am back.

768
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
I am back.

769
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
I am back.

770
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
You are finally back.

771
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Where is he?

772
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
He has left.

773
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
He went to the Demon God's Star Palace

774
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
to find the person he loves.

775
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
He will find Xing Yue.

776
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
I am so happy tonight.

777
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I am so happy tonight.

778
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I am back.

779
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I am back.

780
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I will find Xing Yue.

781
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I am back.

782
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
I am back.

783
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I am so happy tonight.

784
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
I am back.

785
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I am back.

786
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
I am back.

787
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
