Even in gesia, a forest can be a monster when it comes to living.

Yup!

I only want to be with the one I love,

《The Fairy Demon and the scholar》

43
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
Thank you for your help.

44
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
If not for you,

45
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
I would be afraid of dying.

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,540
I am not in the same position as you.

47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,540
You know I won't let you die.

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,540
You dare to go to the Cold Spring Palace to do things.

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,540
I have been married to several people.

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
I can't believe that the old man in the forest has broken up.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Enough.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
You can catch the fairy by yourself.

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
You are so generous.

54
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,540
But I don't think you can do anything.

55
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
I don't think so.

56
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
I am very confident in my behavior.

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
But I don't think it's strange.

58
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Our behavior is very careful.

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
How could he be informed in advance?

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,540
And how could he recognize that I am from the Cold Spring Palace?

61
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Unless...

62
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Chongzhou is also the forest.

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,540
They should be back.

65
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Why are you still here?

66
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,540
I didn't hurt the people in the lake.

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
Uncle,

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,540
I did tell you something earlier.

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
I am sorry.

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
So you are going to tell me

71
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
why you went to the Cold Spring Palace?

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
If I say it's for Lan Ling,

73
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
do you believe me?

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
《The Fairy Demon and the scholar》

75
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Shao Jun!

76
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Chongzhao went to find Uncle Bai again.

77
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Shao Jun, stop helping him.

78
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
He will punish you if you go back.

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
Maybe he will kill you.

80
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
Don't worry.

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
I will not tell you until the last moment.

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Shao Jun, you are thinking of a way out?

83
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
The thing about the book is that it's enough to help Fan Yu.

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
As long as he kills Uncle Bai, he can heal him.

85
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
But...

86
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,540
I don't know why he likes Uncle Bai so much.

87
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,540
He must hate you.

88
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
It's unfair.

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Shao Jun, stop loving him.

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
He is not good at all.

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Xixi, please hate him.

92
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
You are right.

93
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
So this time,

94
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,540
it's my last time to help him.

95
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
I feel sad.

96
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,540
But I have to take the water.

97
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
I can't control my heart.

98
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
It's because he is not enough to help me.

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
He should be hurt in my bones.

100
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
He should be hurt in my fear.

101
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
I can't control my feelings anymore.

102
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
So,

103
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,540
I will take back his blood.

104
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Shao Jun, what are you trying to do?

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
To kill Uncle Bai,

106
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
it's my heart.

107
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
It's a decision.

108
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,540
It's not strange that you are investigating Leng Quan for Lan Ling.

109
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
But Leng Quan is very good at

110
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
dealing with other people.

111
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,540
They are very good at it.

112
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
How did they trust you?

113
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
It's because of Fu Ling.

114
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
He wants me to take the medicine.

115
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
He may have said a lot of good things in front of Zhen Yu.

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Take the medicine?

117
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
You are a fairy.

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
How can you take the medicine?

119
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Do you practice the magic of the demon clan?

120
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
It's complicated.

121
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
Anyway,

122
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,540
Zhen Yu is a person who is fond of you and me.

123
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
He wants to use me to catch you and go back to Leng Quan.

124
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Then you can't go back.

125
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
This time, I can't catch you and go back.

126
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Zhen Yu will not let you go.

127
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
You are going back to Lan Ling now.

128
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
If you have the money to go back to Lan Ling,

129
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
you can be safe.

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
I am safe.

131
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
What about you?

132
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Leng Quan has many evil demons.

133
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Zhen Yu is really good at it.

134
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Even if he doesn't send me,

135
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
he will send others.

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
I am the only one there.

137
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
It's safer for you.

138
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Chong Zhao,

139
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
you have your own way.

140
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
What do you mean?

141
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
I know

142
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
you feel guilty when you are safe with my father.

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
So you are in my shoes.

144
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,540
But you don't have to do that.

145
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Isn't it always like this between us?

146
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Yes.

147
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
You were like this when you were little.

148
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I broke into the world and you stood out.

149
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,540
You stood out when my father was punished.

150
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I remember it all.

151
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
But it's all from the past.

152
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
You didn't change. I didn't change either.

153
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,540
What's the difference between the past and the present?

154
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
Now...

155
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
Now I know it's hard to move forward.

156
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Time is short.

157
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
I wanted to rest from the past.

158
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
It's just to repay the kindness.

159
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
But I found out that

160
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,540
the rest process is also a rest.

161
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
A rest in the heart.

162
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
I got it, I lost it.

163
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
I was in pain.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I was happy.

165
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
I was alone.

166
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
There were many people.

167
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
It's been a hundred years.

168
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
It's been a thousand years.

169
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,540
It's been a thousand years.

170
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
It's been so hard.

171
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
I'm a god.

172
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
What should I do?

173
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
I understand.

174
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
So I chose to hide it from you

175
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
in Ni'an.

176
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
I didn't want you to fall into the mud.

177
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
And I chose to tell you everything.

178
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I want to understand.

179
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
Whether it's about the future or the future.

180
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I will be with you.

181
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
But your plan

182
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
shouldn't have been sealed with you.

183
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,540
Chongzhao,

184
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
you should be a man of the sword.

185
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
You should be a great master of the Blue Forest.

186
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Don't be a criminal because of me.

187
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
You used to be a great doctor in the Cold Spring Palace.

188
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,540
But I hope you can protect yourself.

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,540
If the previous death is a dead end,

190
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,540
you should turn your head away.

191
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Don't sacrifice for nothing.

192
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,540
Don't sacrifice for me.

193
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
But you are good.

194
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm the one who's wronged.

195
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
But I can't bear your wrong.

196
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Then can you be the criminal?

197
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Because you all have to remember it.

198
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
You can be the same.

199
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
It's because I like it.

200
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
It's because I like it.

201
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Even if there are many difficulties

202
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
in the future,

203
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
I still like it.

204
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
In the end,

205
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
it's because you like it.

206
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
It's not me.

207
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
You used to say these words

208
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
to me.

209
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,540
We were two little vegetables.

210
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
When I was in Ning'er City,

211
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
I didn't even understand what I liked.

212
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,540
But I've been through this.

213
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Life and death.

214
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
I've been protecting you for a thousand years.

215
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm not sure of my age.

216
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Chongzhao,

217
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
in this world of love,

218
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,540
the most touching thing in the world,

219
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
it's worth a fair price.

220
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I didn't choose you in the city.

221
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
I have a thousand reasons.

222
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
But my heart has given me the answer.

223
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,540
You should go your own way.

224
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
What's the matter?

225
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
I want to talk to the owner.

226
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
About Ruo Shui Shi.

227
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Gu Wu told me everything.

228
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
I want to make a deal with the owner.

229
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll give Ruo Shui Shi to you.

230
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
You go save Miss Bai.

231
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
But please help me

232
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
to protect my aunt.

233
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Ruo Shui Shi Li Ting, you will die.

234
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
I'll go save Miss Bai.

235
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I'll go save Miss Bai.

236
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
I'll go save Miss Bai.

237
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
I know.

238
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
So,

239
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
please don't tell Tian Huang about this.

240
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
No.

241
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
I won't promise you.

242
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
I don't want to leave anyone.

243
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
If Bai Shuo is here,

244
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
he won't come back.

245
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
And Tian Huang.

246
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
He finally likes someone these years.

247
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
What if you die?

248
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
But it's up to you.

249
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
I've no choice.

250
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
What if Miss Bai dies?

251
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
I'll think of other ways.

252
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
If there are so many ways,

253
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
I'll have to wait for time to kill her.

254
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I saved Miss Bai and the owner

255
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
of the wood wine.

256
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Now I'm back.

257
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,540
I'm dead.

258
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
I just gave you a start.

259
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Your life is given by your aunt.

260
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
So,

261
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
I can't let my aunt die because of me.

262
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Rong Xian killed the Hu tribe.

263
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,540
Although the Hu tribe loves Linglong,

264
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
Linglong has been cursed for years.

265
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
So, she's wronged the Hu tribe.

266
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
And she's given up on Qi.

267
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
She's given up on her life.

268
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Lies, hatred, and hatred.

269
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,540
These are all impulsive things.

270
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,540
One step at a time, one step at a time.

271
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,540
There's no end to it.

272
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
If there's someone who can end this,

273
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
then I'm the one who's suitable.

274
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
So,

275
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
you're doing this to complete everyone's wish

276
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
and to solve all the problems.

277
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
What the owner said.

278
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
It's a bit too much.

279
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
I'm just a

280
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,540
little fox who's been stolen by the fortune.

281
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,540
With the birth of this land,

282
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I'm the most important guardian.

283
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,540
I'm also the one who's forced to do this.

284
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm the one who's made the decision.

285
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
I've been threatened.

286
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
The most fortunate one

287
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
is a girl I met in the middle of love.

288
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
And she seems to like me.

289
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
These common people have the same fortune.

290
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
But my wood wine is the original.

291
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
It's the original.

292
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Fengyu,

293
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
can I call you that?

294
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,540
I have the power

295
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
to save you from my life.

296
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
I've been living for a thousand years.

297
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
And I've been suffering from the loss of my master.

298
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
I've been giving my love to the lord for thousands of years.

299
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
I've been giving my love to the lord for thousands of years.

300
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
I've been giving my love to the lord for thousands of years.

301
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
I have to give my life to these remaining powers

302
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
to bury you in my love.

303
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
But the thing about taking out my power

304
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
is the one who's turned my life again.

305
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
It's very dangerous.

306
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Are you willing to help me?

307
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,540
There's a saying in the human race.

308
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
You'll have to give up once you give up twice.

309
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
I'll...

310
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,540
I...

311
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
will be the one to give up.

312
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
You won't give up?

313
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
You're...

314
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
admitting me?

315
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Then what about Tian Huo?

316
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
I'll say goodbye to him.

317
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
He's worth more.

318
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Don't run away.

319
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Is this the evil spirit that's been put down by the human race?

320
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Yes.

321
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
I personally killed him in Ning'an City.

322
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
Otherwise, the new city's white rain would have died.

323
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,540
It seems that Chongzhao is in good shape.

324
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,540
The Cold Palace is indeed practicing the Xie Chong.

325
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Now that there are many cities that are under the Yangji,

326
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,540
I'm afraid that the Xie Chong will be completely destroyed.

327
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,540
I don't want to.

328
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
This is not a normal Xie Chong.

329
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Is there any way to cure it?

330
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
It takes time to find a cure.

331
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I'm afraid that before we find it, there will be a big mess.

332
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I'll send a message to Chongzhao.

333
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
No matter what,

334
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
we must stop all this

335
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
before the big mess.

336
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
What is this?

337
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
The hair on my tail is a bit soft.

338
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
It's a bit soft.

339
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
You can leave it as a souvenir.

340
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
What do you mean?

341
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You're not leaving?

342
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Why?

343
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
There are too many things in the Hu Clan.

344
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Aunt is getting older.

345
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Ah Hu,

346
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
I think I should take my responsibility.

347
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
You're talking about responsibility.

348
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
Yicheng is the responsibility of Hualin.

349
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Hu Su is your responsibility.

350
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Now it's your responsibility.

351
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Then where did you go earlier?

352
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
No need.

354
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Wait a minute.

355
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
I have something to tell you.

356
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Before I met you,

357
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
I thought that my life was the worst.

358
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
I don't have parents, no friends,

359
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
no freedom.

360
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Until I met you,

361
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
you've been through a lot.

362
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
But you never gave up.

363
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Seeing the water flow,

364
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
it's the most important thing.

365
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
To me,

366
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
I feel happy just being with you.

367
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
What do you mean by that?

368
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Of course, it's meaningful.

369
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
You're meaningful.

370
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I only understand that

371
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
I shouldn't always be apart from you.

372
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
I always give my aunt

373
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
my own choice of life.

374
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
I choose my own life.

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
I like being with you.

376
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
I also like the happiness you bring me.

377
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
But what about me?

378
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,540
Who am I?

379
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
What does my meaning mean?

380
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
I like you.

381
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
It's absolutely not true.

382
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
But I have to stay now.

383
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I want to be like you.

384
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
I want to be like you.

385
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
I want to be like you.

386
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I want to be like you.

387
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
I want to be the choice I should make.

388
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,540
I want to bear the responsibility I deserve.

389
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
Ah Hu.

390
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Ah Hu.

392
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
It's nothing.

393
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
It's all your fault.

394
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
You made a decision.

395
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
But I've made a promise to you.

396
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I've said it before.

397
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
There's nothing wrong with being together.

398
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
But I believe

399
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
the moment you made a promise to me

400
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
is true.

401
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
I like you.

402
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
I believe.

403
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
I believe.

404
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm like you.

405
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Ah Hu.

406
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Can you

407
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
make another promise to me?

408
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
The world is big.

409
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
The road ahead is long.

410
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Promise me.

411
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
No matter what happens in the future,

412
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
just like now,

413
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
just keep going.

414
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
I promise.

415
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Ah Hu.

416
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
Ah Hu.

417
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Ah Hu.

418
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Ah Hu.

419
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
Ah Hu.

420
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Ah Hu.

421
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Ah Hu.

422
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
Ah Hu.

423
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Ah Hu.

424
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,540
Ah Hu.

425
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Ah Hu.

426
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Ah Hu.

427
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
Ah Hu.

428
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Ah Hu.

429
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Ah Hu.

430
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Ah Hu.

431
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Ah Hu.

432
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Ah Hu.

433
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Ah Hu.

434
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Ah Hu.

435
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Ah Hu.

436
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
Ah Hu.

437
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Ah Hu.

438
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Ah Hu.

439
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Ah Hu.

440
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Ah Hu.

441
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,540
Ah Hu.

442
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Ah Hu.

443
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Aunt's wish has been fulfilled.

444
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Uncle Qing is no longer here.

445
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Unfortunately,

446
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
if he's gone,

447
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,540
he's going to die.

448
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
I'll ask you one last time.

449
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
Have you really thought about it?

450
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,540
I've thought about it.

451
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
This thing,

452
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
please give it to Miss Bai.

453
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
This is...

454
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
The durian.

455
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
I'm afraid I won't say it.

456
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
You two are wasting time on nothing.

457
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Even if you're a demon,

458
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
you must be brave.

459
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
If you love each other,

460
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
don't think about coming back.

461
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
Just do it now.

462
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Thank you.

463
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
I've lost my love.

464
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
The sky and fire are moving.

465
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
No one will come to the forest.

466
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
It's easy to get hurt.

467
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Are you going to catch me?

468
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I was wrong.

469
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
I was going to kill you.

470
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
What?

471
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Do you think it's strange?

472
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,540
What Chongzhao said is a catcher.

473
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
But when I'm here,

474
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm not going to kill you.

475
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
I'm going to kill you.

476
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm going to kill you.

477
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm going to kill you.

478
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
I'm going to catch you.

479
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
But when I'm here,

480
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm going to kill you.

481
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Do you know that Chongzhao came to me?

482
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Of course.

483
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
How can I go back and sell him?

484
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
So are you going to love him

485
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
for the rest of your life?

486
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Or do you want to be without love?

487
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Or are you just a greedy lover?

488
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
Cut the crap.

489
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
Kill me.

490
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
Aren't you afraid of

491
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
the anti-coward?

492
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Afraid?

493
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
I've long forgotten

494
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
what the fear is.

495
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
There are things

496
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
that I'm afraid of.

497
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
I'm afraid of what I'm going to do.

498
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm afraid of what I'm going to do.

499
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
I have to do everything

500
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
to save my life.

501
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I can't live

502
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
enough for someone

503
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
who's not brave enough.

504
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Where did you get this?

505
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
What's wrong?

506
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
I'm sorry.

507
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
In the scene,

509
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I gave you the first gift.

510
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
So I can

511
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
take some more gifts for you.

512
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
If it's a gift,

513
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
you'll be in trouble.

514
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
If you need any help,

515
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
go ahead.

516
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Thank you.

517
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I should thank you.

518
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Tell me.

519
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
Who gave you this knife?

520
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Why would I remember?

521
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
The word is so stupid.

522
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
If you don't want to kill us,

523
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
why don't you do it?

524
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
You're so insensitive.

525
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I really thought

526
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
I couldn't help you.

527
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
To be honest,

528
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
there are many ways

529
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
to make people die.

530
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
I might not

531
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
have the heart to kill you.

532
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
I'll kill you.

533
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
If you didn't kill me,

534
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
I wouldn't have

535
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
the chance to save you.

536
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
You've left

537
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
many blood just now.

538
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
But you really think

539
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
you can live forever?

540
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
I'll kill you.

541
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
The god is weak.

542
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
You should admit

543
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
that your father is like this.

544
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
He thought he could change

545
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
everything with his life.

546
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
That's because

547
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
you didn't have

548
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
anything but your life.

549
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
I'll wait for you here

550
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
until you die.

551
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
No.

552
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
I can't die here.

553
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,540
I haven't returned the money.

554
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
I haven't paid the debt.

555
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
I haven't finished my journey.

556
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
I can't die

557
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
in front of the mountains.

558
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Shuang,

559
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
you can climb up

560
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
when you fall.

561
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Uncle.

562
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Uncle,

563
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
get up.

564
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Are you okay?

565
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Where are you hurting?

566
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
I'm fine.

567
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Be careful.

568
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Don't you hurt on the ground?

569
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,540
I'm fine.

570
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm fine.

571
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
I'm fine.

572
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Shi Tou,

573
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
don't bother me.

574
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
I want to stay alone tonight.

575
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Aren't you leaving?

576
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Since that,

577
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
why are you here?

578
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I know I shouldn't come.

579
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
I know I shouldn't come.

580
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
But I'm thinking about it.

581
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I don't know

582
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
what you're thinking about.

583
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
I don't want to think about it.

584
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
But I know

585
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
that

586
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
you shouldn't come back

587
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
after making your decision.

588
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Erhuang,

589
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
I can't bear to leave you.

590
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm not by your side.

591
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,540
What should you do

592
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
after you feel sad?

593
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
There's a master on the top.

594
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
He's a hidden mountain.

595
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
If we lose to the same person,

596
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
we'll be back.

597
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
What should I do

598
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
if you're sick,

599
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
tired,

600
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
and miss me?

601
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
My heart is sick.

602
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
My body is sick.

603
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
As for you,

604
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
I'll forget the feelings.

605
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
I've touched your heart.

606
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
But I've touched it too.

607
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
If you do,

608
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
you'll forget it.

609
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,540
That's good.

610
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
Forgetting me is good too.

611
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I'm afraid of hate.

612
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
I just hope you can live well.

613
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
I'll always believe

614
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
when we first met,

615
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
you were lying in front of me

616
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,540
and dressed up as a doctor.

617
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I was safe with you.

618
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
I was afraid that you'd be lonely

619
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
and take care of someone.

620
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
I've thought about it a lot.

621
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
I've thought about it a lot.

622
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
But I'm so happy

623
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
that I can be with you.

624
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Are you done?

625
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
Just leave after you finish talking.

626
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm leaving.

627
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Goodbye.

628
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
I've never wanted to give you

629
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
what I've been thinking about.

630
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,540
I've forgotten

631
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
the feelings I've touched.

632
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,540
I've touched your heart.

633
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I'm your love.

634
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,540
I'm your love.

635
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm your love.

636
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm your love.

637
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm your love.

638
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
I've touched your heart.

639
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm your love.

640
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm your love.

641
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
I'm your love.

642
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
I'm your love.

643
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
I'm your love.

644
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,540
I'm your love.

645
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
I'm your love.

646
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,540
I'm your love.

647
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
I'm your love.

648
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,540
I'm your love.

649
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
I'm your love.

650
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,540
I'm your love.

651
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
She's dead.

652
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
She can't save them.

653
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
It's her choice.

654
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
My father died.

655
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
It's her choice.

656
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Qi died.

657
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Qi died.

658
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
It's her choice.

659
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,540
Why are there so many cruel choices in the world?

660
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Why is there no way to do it?

661
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Why can't we live well

662
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
with the one we love?

663
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
The night is dark.

664
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Jin Yao is resting.

665
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
The choice is

666
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
maybe the same as resting.

667
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
If so,

668
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,540
what's the point of her becoming a woman?

669
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
She has a demon on her body.

670
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
She has a demon on her body.

671
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Even if she becomes a god,

672
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
can she take these helplessness

673
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
and return to her freedom?

674
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
I don't know.

675
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
But I know

676
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,540
that not all the deaths are the end.

677
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
The time when the mother saved her was very calm.

678
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
She even asked me to give you this.

679
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Miss Bai,

680
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
when you saw me,

681
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
I was already dead.

682
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
So,

683
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
remember to remember

684
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
my handsome face well.

685
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
I've been thinking about it

686
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
lately.

687
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Demon,

688
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
in fact, like someone,

689
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
you can't be a demon.

690
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
But you can't be a demon.

691
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Demon,

692
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
in fact, like someone,

693
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
you are very stupid.

694
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
In the past 20 years,

695
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
I've never thought

696
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
that I would be like a hero.

697
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
In order to save others,

698
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
the past is very childish,

699
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
very stubborn.

700
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
What responsibility,

701
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
morality,

702
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
I know it's all bullshit.

703
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
But when did you start to change?

704
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Probably

705
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
in the first place,

706
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
when I started to be with you.

707
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
I started to have friends.

708
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I had a family.

709
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Besides aunt,

710
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Ah Hu is the first person

711
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
who saved me when I was in crisis.

712
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
Miss Bai, you are the second.

713
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
I really like Ah Hu.

714
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
So,

715
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
can you please take good care of him

716
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
for me in the future?

717
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Right,

718
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
there is a shopkeeper.

719
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
Before I met you,

720
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
he thought you were a

721
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
a person who kills people.

722
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
But now I found out

723
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
you are just

724
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
a friend of mine.

725
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
You will fall in love with someone

726
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
who is ordinary.

727
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I finally understand now

728
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
whether it's a person

729
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
or a demon,

730
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
as long as there is a牽掛,

731
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
there is a reason

732
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
why the heart is not stopped.

733
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Miss Bai,

734
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
if water is what I am willing to give you,

735
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
I don't want anyone else.

736
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
My life in Mujiu

737
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
is also the end of all the love

738
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
in Jingyou Mountain.

739
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
In the future,

740
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
promise me

741
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
that you will take me with you.

742
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Don't be afraid of anyone,

743
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
and anything.

744
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Continue to be with fate.

745
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Don't fight each other.

746
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,540
The end of all the fate.

747
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Everything has been a long time ago.

748
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,540
The rest of my life is in the past.

749
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,540
I am in the end.

750
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
I want to know

751
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,540
how to thank you.

752
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,540
When you put love in my heart,

753
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,540
when my heart is only for you.

754
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
When the sky and the earth are limited,

755
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,540
I can still meet you.

756
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,540
Everyone says

757
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
that the firepower is the most deceiving.

758
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
Mujiu,

759
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
you lied to me,

760
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
but when you saw it from the beginning,

761
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,540
you were always beaten by me.

762
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
I don't blame you anymore.

763
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
I will remember what you said,

764
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,540
and the firepower.

765
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,540
I will continue to be with you.

766
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,540
I believe in you.

767
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
I believe in you.

768
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
You are now

769
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
giving me the back of your head.

770
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,540
You trust me?

771
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,540
I don't trust you.

772
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
It's all because of Lengquan Palace.

773
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,540
That's why you saved me?

774
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
If something happens to you,

775
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
the princess won't let me go.

776
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
Lengquan Palace is out of the Fulin Demon Lord.

777
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Chongzhao Demon Lord is on the top.

778
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Isn't that better?

779
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Just as you are the savior of the Yicheng,

780
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,540
I don't want to owe others mercy.

781
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
You saved me from the White Beast,

782
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
and you don't want him to hate you.

783
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
Since the day I was in the Demon Lord,

784
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,540
I thought that this day would come.

785
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Since I can't go back,

786
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
then I have nothing to worry about.

787
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
You shouldn't have saved me.

788
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
You want to die?

789
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,540
You have been asking me to die, right?

790
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,540
Since you want to die,

791
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
you shouldn't have given me hope

792
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
and hope for a good and kind heart.

793
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Did you feel any pain

794
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
when you were injured today?

795
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
What pain?

796
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
Nothing.

797
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
I'll be back in Lengquan tomorrow.

798
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,540
You should think about

799
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
how to explain to the master.

800
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,540
Search

801
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,800

802
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,540

Don't be afraid, my heart will only be yours

808
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:18,540
Come, come

809
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:26,540
My heart is so excited

810
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Wait for me

811
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:38,040
My heart is so excited

812
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,540
You are the light I want to see

813
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,540
You are the only way

814
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:53,540
I want to be with you

815
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:00,540
I want to be with you

816
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,540
I want to be with you

817
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:12,540
You are the light I want to see

818
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,540
You are the only way

819
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:23,540
I want to be with you

820
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:32,540
I want to be with you

821
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,540
I want to be with you
