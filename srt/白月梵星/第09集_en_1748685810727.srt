1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
Some time later...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are willing to be as a star, as a moon.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are here together.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We are here together.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We are not here to fight.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We are here.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We are here.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't stand in the way.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Think about it.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You should be a star.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You should be a star.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
crave...

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
why there are evil spirits in theор-asu Spirits?

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
what is evil spirit?

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and the Martial Sun is written here,

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
the Fairy Demons are reciting this Spirit Reaper 운

27
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,000
strange spirit.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
as shoes on the own Schönagayo,

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
shoes?

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A normalMthe ужеし 精 status called glass judge.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There is a blood line.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There must be a blood line in the Yicheng City.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Tenshi Garden?

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It must be the one who led us to Yicheng.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Will the blood line show up with the next year?

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Anshou! Anshou!

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Fengyu! Fengyu!

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Fengyu!

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Fengyu!

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yicheng is in trouble. He is not affected.

41
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Fengyu!

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have seen this monster in the Wuni Temple.

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's go.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Anshou.

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry about anything.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Who are you? How dare you enter the Yicheng City?

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yicheng City?

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry.

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's retreat.

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are in the inn today.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can't report to the innkeeper.

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Please forgive me for being rude to you.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't say that.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I saw a blood line in the Yicheng City.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did you see it wrong?

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yicheng has never been in the Xiexiu City.

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How could there be blood lines?

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not wrong. We chased him all the way here.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We saw him enter the Yicheng City.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can go with me to investigate.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Since the innkeeper saw it,

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will report this to the King and search the palace.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But this is the Yicheng City.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's not appropriate for you to enter the palace at this time.

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have reported the blood line.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not necessary to investigate.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Xiexiu is not as good as the three tribes.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If there is blood line in the city,

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the Yicheng City will be in trouble.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You clearly see that the King and the innkeeper

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
have stopped us from entering the palace to investigate the monster.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why are you so worried?

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If that monster is really related to the King of Yiren,

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
what do you think you can find out if you are so impulsive?

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You have to leave Xiao Ming in there.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You don't need to find these reasons.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The Hall of the Moon Hall is willing to be gathered in the palace.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How could you really be worried about me, Xiao Ming?

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hall Master.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hall Master, did you catch that monster?

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That monster entered the Yicheng City.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You came just in time.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tell me, who are you?

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Before entering the Yicheng City,

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I thought you were weird.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You seem to be very sensitive to the Yicheng City.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yicheng is in the woods.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You should be aware of the rules.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But you can use your spiritual power.

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you a Yiren?

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But Yiren is born with spiritual power.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And your spiritual power is strong enough to kill thousands of people.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's enough to make you the position of the Hall of the Moon Hall.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are the one who needs it.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It has nothing to do with you.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It has nothing to do with me?

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I have a deal with the Hall of the Moon Hall.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Even if it's a deal, it should be trusted.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now Yicheng is in a state of chaos.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have to be careful.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can stop the deal.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You should have known the true identity of the Fire God.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The identity of the Fire God is very different from the fire of the Fire of the Heart.

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fengyu, I know you are very capable.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't beat you.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But it doesn't mean that I have to accept your lies and lies.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't care about his identity.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I need to respect and respect the trust and cooperation between us.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Tianhu, you should leave.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes, Hall Leader.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Tianhu is indeed a person.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
As for why she can break through the spiritual power of the Fire God,

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
this is her own business.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It has nothing to do with you and me.

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Everyone has secrets.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't ask.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But since she is a person,

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
she should know Yicheng very well.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
When I was looking for Yicheng's entrance,

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
she was so scared that she killed me.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Did the Fire God provide any clues?

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The Fire God has been with me for seven years.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She has never contacted Yicheng for seven years.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yicheng's entrance changes every year.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The exact location is unknown.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You, me, Tianhuo, and I are all unknown.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now that Yicheng has entered the city,

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
does she know nothing about the fire of the Fire God?

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
She doesn't know anything.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you have no doubt about her?

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No doubt.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can have no doubt.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why should I trust her?

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You should trust me.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't trust anyone except myself.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In order to protect you,

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can promise that if I don't die,

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
no one can harm you.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It sounds like you are touched.

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Fengyue,

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you tried your best to protect her.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I didn't protect her.

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not me.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's Master Wu Nian.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Isn't it you?

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Of course you can prove it.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So,

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
don't forget the moves.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't forget the power.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You always look for the stars and the stars.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The things you need to do are only in this store.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's all.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then that's all.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After all these,

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
we have nothing else to do.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
After seven years,

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I feel that

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the city has changed a lot.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't say that.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Even if you are alone,

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
too many changes will happen in seven years.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I know Hualing.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In the city,

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
any wind and grass

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
are under her skin.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
She might not know

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
what's going on.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The cultivation of the blood

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
is not a big deal.

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's just a matter of time.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know what's going on.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The cultivation of the blood is not as good as the three tribes.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If the blood is really related to the King of the One,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the whole One Tribe

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
will definitely be attacked by the two tribes of the Fairy Demon.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't worry, Master.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will leave that day

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and have nothing to do with the Yidu.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I will go back to Yicheng

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and not only to help you.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will investigate the matter of the monster.

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
General, what's wrong?

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You go first.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will be there at last.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You really know how to investigate the matter.

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think you should go to the Yidu.

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I've been following you since you were young.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't know you were here.

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Queen.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yicheng and I are no longer the Queen.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We are no longer the Queen.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hua Hong.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't call me Hua Hong.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am the Heavenly Fire of the House of Hao Yue.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Heavenly Fire Demon,

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
are you well these years?

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm not here to make you feel warm.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why would the King have a monster?

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop acting like a fool.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I am wearing the guard's uniform.

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't find anything suspicious.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't worry.

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If there is something in the palace,

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will not let you down.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You are still the same as before.

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You are so bold.

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you have any fault in the palace?

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You know it very well.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If the Heavenly Demon knew,

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
you would be in trouble

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
if you keep protecting Yicheng.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The palace is a holy place.

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It is not easy to get a monster.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The Demon Lord doesn't have to worry about it.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yicheng is not related to me.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where is the second Star Fire?

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are wearing the Demon Lord's uniform

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and are not in the same room.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You should follow the rules and be fair.

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What right do you have to talk to me about fairness?

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
At least,

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you should call me uncle.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Uncle?

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You are my mother's brother.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You grew up with my grandfather's uniform.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I saved all the glory of you and the Demon Lord.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But how did you treat him?

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are talking about fairness with me now.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Where were you when my mother was forced to die?

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My family was finally king of Yi.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Your mother died for Yicheng.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you insist on saving her death,

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
you should do it.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will give my life to Meijiang.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The Demon Lord

243
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Stop!

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Your Majesty.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
My mother is my mother.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I am the Demon Lord.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You are my mother.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I am the Demon Lord.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Since you are gone,

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
why did you come back?

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You want to take the Star Fire?

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You want to fight with me?

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You are here to find out who you are.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No matter who you are,

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
you will not be alone.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Even if you are an outsider,

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you must take the trouble of breaking into the palace.

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Your Majesty,

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the Demon Lord is the guardian of the House of Hao.

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We can't fight with the owner of the House of Hao.

261
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please think twice.

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Get out!

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now, get out of the palace.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Get out of here!

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Never come back!

266
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Take me to the Star Fire.

267
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I will never see you again.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The Demon Lord

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I miss you every day, Your Majesty.

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I finally see you today.

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why is it so hard to get along with you?

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They shouldn't have come back now.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They have found out.

274
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sure they won't save this bad brother.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Until now,

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
we can only plan it out.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then, Your Majesty,

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
if he stops the plan,

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
we won't be able to save him.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Brother Chengzhao,

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
where are you going at this late night?

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Uncle Bai, I'm back.

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I saw him in the room just now.

285
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Did something happen?

286
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Of course you can think so.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So, don't forget to move and to think.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You are looking for the Star Fire.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's only the second time

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you need to do it.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's right.

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's only the second time.

293
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Uncle Bai!

294
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Uncle Bai!

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're fine.

296
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The monster just now...

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's a problem.

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If there's no reason to stay,

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
leave immediately.

300
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Today,

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I saw the commander.

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It sounds like you're moved.

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Fengyu,

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you tried your best to protect him.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's not me,

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but the thing that's missing.

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Come in.

309
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I saw Hua Ling.

310
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What did she say?

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
She doesn't admit that the monster is related to me.

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
She just wants me to get out of here.

313
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It seems that we're going to the Star Fire this time.

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We've already fought.

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Although I'm not familiar with the King of the Yiren,

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
he's also a good friend of Wei Ming's.

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
As a father,

318
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm not familiar with the King of the Yiren.

319
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm just a friend of Wei Ming's.

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not familiar with the King of the Yiren.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm just a friend of Wei Ming's.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
As a father,

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
she's been with you for seven years.

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She's already seen you and made you leave the Yiren.

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Some words are a bit absurd,

326
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but it's also true.

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm afraid the King is too worried.

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's just a poor man.

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He doesn't deserve to be a friend.

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No matter what,

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
the most important thing now

333
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
is to find the Star Fire first.

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why didn't you tell me that Fu Ling was here?

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You said you saw her as a murderer,

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but you did nothing to her.

337
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm not interested.

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So,

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
you made a decision for me again.

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I just don't want you to be involved.

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's your idea.

342
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Chongzhao,

343
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't want to fight with you

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
because of this.

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I know very well that I can't kill her now.

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I will keep my life

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and kill her and Zhenyu one by one.

348
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But Fu Ling is in the Yicheng.

349
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's not easy behind.

350
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If there's any news,

351
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
please don't hide it from me.

352
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I promise you.

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Have a good rest.

355
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If there's anything,

356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
you can call me anytime.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You...

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It seems that

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
he still can't

360
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
completely congratulate Chongzhao.

361
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Chongzhao

362
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
can't love me.

363
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Of course, he loves you.

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What do you want to say?

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Nothing.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You should rest early.

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What do you want to say?

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Nothing.

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You should rest early.

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The fire and the demon army have been defeated.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The food is so delicious.

372
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Are you used to it?

373
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm not talking about the food.

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not going to eat it.

375
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I want to eat it.

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I will eat it.

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You have to eat it.

378
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I will eat it.

379
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

380
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can't eat it.

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I will eat it.

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I will eat it.

383
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I will eat it.

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I will eat it.

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I will eat it.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't talk too much.

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You are so polite.

388
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I just gave you a gift.

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Please.

390
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Where is he?

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He just left.

392
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You shouldn't interfere with the fire.

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Huayong.

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Sister.

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't call me sister.

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You are disgusting.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I said

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you should never appear in front of me.

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I thought you would come back

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and forgive me.

401
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Forgive me?

402
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You just want me to forget

403
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
everything that happened before?

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not what you think.

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Shut up.

406
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I will warn you one more time.

407
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You and I have nothing to do with each other.

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you dare to appear again,

409
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I will never let you go.

410
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Don't interfere with the fire.

411
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Who said I should interfere with the fire?

412
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I am willing to go to Lian'er

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
for the first fire.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You are alone?

415
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No.

416
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Where are you going?

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The owner of the shop

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
is talking to me.

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why should I tell you?

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Master.

421
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What happened to him today?

422
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He is really alone?

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He is the one who is left behind.

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Where is he going?

425
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What if he is in danger?

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Danger?

427
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He made his own decision.

428
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's his fault.

429
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Mother, what is this word?

430
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a person.

431
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's a person.

432
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What's the difference between a person and a person?

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Nothing.

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's a whole different story.

435
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The top and the bottom are the same.

436
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's you.

437
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why did you come here?

438
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I came to deliver the medicine to Hu'er.

439
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have something to ask.

440
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Hu'er, you go play next to her.

441
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Mother, I will teach you a lesson later.

442
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay?

443
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Good boy.

445
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What do you want to ask?

446
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Do you know where the second heart is?

447
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The heart is the one who is responsible for his own actions.

448
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
How would I know?

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you know that there is a monster in the city?

450
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He attacked you.

451
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You know it.

452
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What is he?

453
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
No one knows what he is.

454
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He only knows that he first appeared

455
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in a nightclub seven years ago.

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Seven years ago again?

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That year, he killed many people in the city.

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And he was abandoned for a long time.

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
He heard his news occasionally.

460
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Some say he is the spirit of the artist.

461
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Some say he is a monk who practiced art.

462
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But he never made a decision.

463
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Later, the king was worried that the people would be confused.

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So he ordered not to talk about it again.

465
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So he only appeared in the nightclub?

466
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Maybe.

467
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No one has seen him in the daytime anyway.

468
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you know anything else?

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You don't have to ask too much about the artist.

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I tell you this

471
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to repay your kindness to Huo'er.

472
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You said that the artist has no difference with the person.

473
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You are wrong.

474
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The suffering of the artist is a fairy demon.

475
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Including your race.

476
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can't understand it at all.

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You go.

478
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I can only say so much.

479
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Your friend has been waiting for you there for a long time.

480
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Go back earlier.

481
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's late at night.

482
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You can't go back.

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's not safe to enter the nightclub.

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Why are you here?

485
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't pretend to be silly.

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't get the advantage and buy a dream.

487
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I am the owner of the shop.

488
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I will not let me die.

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I dare to take the eggs from the private room.

490
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Go.

491
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I advise you not to use these smart people on me.

492
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But you still come?

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I won't do it again.

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's late.

495
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's late.

496
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Go back.

497
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't want to meet the bad guys.

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You can't use the smart people anymore.

499
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's late.

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't be so silly.

501
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I am silly?

502
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You are always silly.

503
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Say it again.

504
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I won't.

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Say it again.

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I won't.

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I won't.

508
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Your Majesty.

509
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The first new fire is sent to Bai Shuo.

510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There is a criminal escort around him.

511
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Even if the monster is not convinced,

512
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
he will not be able to do it.

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I saw the sincerity of Yicheng.

514
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's the Fuling Yaoju of Lengquan Palace.

515
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's a good idea.

516
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

517
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Your Majesty, you have a good memory.

518
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You are the first one to promote the two new fires.

519
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I am very touched.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Since we are working together,

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
we are all good people.

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I will not be careless.

523
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Please do it faster.

524
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
In case of a nightmare.

525
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The Fuling Yaoju of Lengquan Palace

526
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Your Majesty.

527
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Your Majesty.

528
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hurry up.

529
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Look.

530
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Look.

531
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Look.

532
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Look.

533
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Look.

534
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What is this?

535
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What is this?

536
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
What is this?

537
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What is this?

538
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What is this?

539
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What is this?

540
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Where is this?

541
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Where is this?

542
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There is this.

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It was the monster yesterday.

544
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Look.

545
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Look.

546
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Who is there?

547
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Go.

548
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Go.

549
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Go.

550
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Don't you think it's suspicious?

551
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The monster knows that the fairy demon

552
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
will not let go of the monster.

553
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He is still here.

554
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I know.

555
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Then you have to chase him.

556
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You can only know if you chase him.

557
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What is the meaning of this situation?

558
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Go.

559
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Brother.

560
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then we can't chase him.

561
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You stay in the inn.

562
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
If there is anything,

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you can take care of him.

564
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You two go with me.

565
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yes.

566
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Go.

567
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Go.

568
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hurry.

569
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Go.

570
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Hurry.

571
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hurry.

572
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hurry.

573
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Go.

574
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Hurry.

575
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Over there.

576
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Go.

577
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Go.

578
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Look at me.

579
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't believe that the monster has run away.

580
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That person.

581
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Where is this?

582
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This is the one-eyed one.

583
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
One-eyed one?

584
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Why can't I see it in one piece?

585
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Whose tomb is that?

586
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
One person is dead.

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's not necessary to bury the dead in the heaven and earth.

588
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But it's not one person who is buried in the tomb.

589
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's...

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Hey.

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's the West Lake in Wudong.

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
West Lake?

593
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What's that?

594
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's the West Lake.

595
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
West Lake?

596
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
West Lake?

597
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
West Lake?

598
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's there.

599
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's quiet and quiet.

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
There are so many people here.

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm sorry.

602
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's not tiring to kill people.

603
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's tiring to bury people.

604
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What's going on?

605
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Senior.

606
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We're not here to steal the new fire.

607
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We're here for the monster.

608
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Since the monster is missing,

609
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we'll leave first.

610
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
If there's anything wrong,

611
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
please forgive us.

612
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Why are you leaving?

613
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The new fire is right there.

614
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's dangerous here.

615
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We should go back first.

616
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go back to the city.

617
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is not a new fire.

618
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's mine.

619
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You two, calm down.

620
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hurry up.

621
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Hurry up.

622
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
No way.

623
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Isn't Yicheng the Jinling Sect?

624
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Why are you using magic?

625
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's okay.

626
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Are you a person?

627
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Master, let's go.

628
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I can't take it anymore.

629
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Since you're here,

630
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
please stay with me.

631
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't care who you are.

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I must take this new fire away.

633
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Tianhuo.

634
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Why did she become like this?

635
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is her original look.

636
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The fire is burning.

637
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm going to kill her.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I can't take it anymore.

639
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't want to hurt you.

640
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll kill you, too.

641
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You can't do this to me.

642
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I have to go back.

643
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll kill you.

644
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll kill you.

645
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'll kill you.

646
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll kill you.

647
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll kill you.

648
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'll kill you.

649
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Xue Lian Shengjian?

650
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Is he...

651
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Wake up.

652
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Senior Rong Xian.

653
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What's wrong?

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Senior Rong Xian.

655
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Isn't Senior Rong Xian

656
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
dead a thousand years ago?

657
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Why is he still alive

658
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
a thousand years ago?

659
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Rong Xian?

660
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He's already dead.

661
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You all die for me.

662
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You're a wretch.

663
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'll kill you.

664
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll kill you.

665
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Senior Mu Jiu,

666
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
why are you here?

667
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
How could this happen?

668
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He's not Rong Xian.

669
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He's just a source of

670
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:26,800
the

671
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He's not a wretch.

672
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If he's still alive,

673
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
we'll have to die.

674
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We'll find a way

675
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
to get rid of the

676
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
wretch and get back to the Star Fire.

677
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Wretch.

678
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Get out of here.

679
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Get out of here.

680
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll destroy the Star Fire.

681
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll destroy the Star Fire.

682
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
We'll have the Fox Clan

683
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and the Linglong Xiangyue to avenge.

684
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Get out.

685
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Be careful.

686
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Get out.

687
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Master's leaving

688
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,040
he's everywhere!

689
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,800
I can't make it here.

690
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Let's go!

691
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Don't come!

692
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,200
Be quick!

693
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,300
Thank you, 5000 Faster vocês

girl hi

Le massage

blue

703
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,420
really

704
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:49,460
easy

705
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,640
acne

706
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
We are not in the same species?

707
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Why are we here suddenly?

708
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Where is this?

709
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,640
This is my home, Kunlun.

710
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Kunlun?

711
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Kunlun?

712
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,640
No, this Kunlun is not right.

713
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
It's not right?

714
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Wuji Hall.

715
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,640
It's been destroyed a thousand years ago.

716
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Awu!

717
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Awu, I told you not to come here.

718
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
You can't listen to me.

719
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
If I didn't send the tiger's iron to the mountain in advance,

720
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
you would have been in such a hurry to pass Kunlun.

721
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
You wouldn't have been able to get in the mountain.

722
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
You would have been in a hurry to pass Kunlun.

723
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Who is she?

724
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Who is Awu?

725
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
And you, Aqi.

726
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,640
You are the most stable and strong Pudong.

727
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Why did you let her escape this time?

728
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
If something goes wrong,

729
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
you will be punished by ten lives.

730
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Aqi?

731
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
Pudong?

732
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Me?

733
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
What?

734
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
Me?

735
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Miss?

736
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
What Miss?

737
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Which Miss?

738
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
What about me?

739
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
What am I?

740
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Look at you.

741
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
You are so stupid.

742
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
You are so stupid.

743
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
You three are here to steal my snow lotus.

744
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Steal snow lotus?

745
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Especially you.

746
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Xiaoba,

747
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
you are the most stable and strong Pudong.

748
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
If Aqi hadn't been in front of you,

749
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
how could you have the chance to get this merit?

750
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Yes.

751
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
You will be in Kunlun soon.

752
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Take your temper away.

753
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Don't be in a hurry to pass Kunlun.

754
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Do you remember?

755
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I am Xiaoba.

756
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Xiaoba is me.

757
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I should have said that.

758
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
You are quite good at fighting.

759
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
What are you doing today?

760
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Talk to me.

761
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I remember.

762
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I won't fight.

763
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
What is going on?

764
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
It's not clear.

765
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Stop talking.

766
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Chief Linglong.

767
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
The chief has received the message of the Hu tribe.

768
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Please follow me to the mountain.

769
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Linglong?

770
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
The Hu tribe's daughter?

771
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Yes.

772
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Snow lotus?

773
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
The daughter of Linglong?

774
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I remember.

775
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
She...

776
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Let's go.

777
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Everyone.

778
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Ling Xi.

779
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Ning Shen.

780
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Kunlun's brother is in danger.

781
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
The poison is small.

782
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
The poison is very strong.

783
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
I, Kunlun, know that.

784
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
I will not let you down.

785
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Who told you that?

786
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
What is going on?

787
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I was not in the city.

788
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Why did you come to Kunlun?

789
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Kunlun is my death weapon.

790
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
I have been in the city for a long time.

791
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
I am in the air.

792
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I am like a fox.

793
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Stop.

794
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
What are you doing?

795
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
What are you doing?

796
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Why did you come here?

797
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Do you want to kill me?

798
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Do you want to kill me first?

799
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
I can't fight you.

800
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Ling Jian.

801
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I don't understand.

802
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I don't understand.

803
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
You are stealing again.

804
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
You are not in the city.

805
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
In the city?

806
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
What city?

807
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I am Kunlun's disciple.

808
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Of course, I am a swordsman.

809
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
I am a Kunlun's disciple.

810
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Kunlun Sword?

811
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
How can you have such a big thing in my hand?

812
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Take it.

813
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
Get out.

814
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
You are so weak.

815
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
You are so weak.

816
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
You can't get your identity.

817
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,640
I am going to die today.

818
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
How can I kill you?

819
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Get out.

820
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I will come to you.

821
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
It's okay.

822
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Die.

823
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
When will I be able to control the sword?

824
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
No.

825
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Why did I break my heart?

826
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Stop.

827
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Rongxian?

828
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Didn't Rongxian just die?

829
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Who is this?

830
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
When is he?

831
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Who am I?

832
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Shengzi.

833
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Why are you fighting with the sect?

834
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Shengzi, I have a message.

835
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
The disciples in the sect need to practice swordsmanship.

836
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
They need to prepare to fight with the Hu tribe at any time.

837
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
But he is stealing now.

838
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
He won't practice swordsmanship.

839
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
I...

840
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I will take the responsibility.

841
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Why don't you want to practice swordsmanship?

842
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Why should I?

843
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Why do you practice swordsmanship as a Kunlun disciple?

844
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Just to kill the Hu tribe?

845
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
I am full of food.

846
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
What does he mean?

847
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
What does he mean?

848
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
What does he mean?

849
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
What I mean is...

850
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
The Hu tribe didn't do anything to harm the people.

851
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
It's just that...

852
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
It's delicious.

853
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
And the sun is shining.

854
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
It doesn't need to be seen.

855
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
You are so cruel.

856
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I know you well.

857
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
There are some other things to see.

858
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
The Hu tribe is inviting people to talk.

859
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
I want to meet the holy girl of the Hu tribe.

860
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
You can go with me.

861
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
The holy girl of the Hu tribe?

862
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
I am not living in this place.

863
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
You are also alive.

864
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Follow me.

865
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
You...

866
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Cang Shan.

867
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
It's useless.

868
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,640
They have entered the illusion of the fairy moon.

869
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Even if you break the illusion,

870
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
you can only exist in the present.

871
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
You can't enter the illusion.

872
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,640
That monster deliberately took the fairy moon.

873
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
You want to see the fairy moon.

874
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Kill the fairy moon.

875
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,640
The fairy illusion is the second level of the Wutong Five-Sword.

876
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
It's a new level.

877
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
It's a new illusion.

878
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
It's a rule.

879
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
The fairy moon has been in the world for thousands of years.

880
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
How can it break it?

881
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Then you should see

882
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,640
if the king of the Demon King is the real master.

883
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I have a word with you.

884
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
If the lord of the temple is in trouble,

885
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,640
I will take the Demon King of the Hall of the Hall to the level of one.

886
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
The level of one is yours.

887
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
At least you have the grace of the Yang Yu.

888
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
What right do you have to be with the king?

889
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
If I can't wait for the lord of the temple to come back,

890
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
then the whole city will be destroyed.

891
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I finally understand.

892
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
While Linglong is not here,

893
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
let's quickly team up.

894
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
The Hu tribe came to Kunlun this time.

895
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
The surface is a peace talk.

896
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
It's actually to steal Kunlun's blood lotus

897
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
and go back to the old tribe leader to die.

898
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
But Linglong and the fairy moon

899
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
have already died.

900
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Did Wu Nian bring us back a thousand years ago?

901
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
This is not a real thousand years ago.

902
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
This is the memory of the fairy moon.

903
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Yi Cheng is in the spirit?

904
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
This is really the fairy moon.

905
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
When we came in, it was Wu Nian.

906
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,640
But now it's our fault.

907
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
It's the fairy moon.

908
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
How can it be seen?

909
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,640
If it's not his idea,

910
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
we will not become the one

911
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
who exists in his memory.

912
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Then how are we going to get out?

913
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
To follow his life to death,

914
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
the fairy moon will naturally be destroyed.

915
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
How can this be?

916
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
What if it can live for decades?

917
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Will we have to be here for decades?

918
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Shengzi can't live for so long.

919
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,640
That's right.

920
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
You are a Kunlun disciple.

921
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Tell me.

922
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
What happened

923
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
a thousand years ago?

924
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,640
Love is a dream.
