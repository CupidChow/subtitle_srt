—

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Time is here.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
We are here.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I only want to see every star with my beloved one.

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,800
You and him are not the same person.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
One of our ancestors.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
A loyal actually.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
For the sake of you.

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,960
Heneleven,

12
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,800
I have a request for you.

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,520
My birthday this year is...

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,160
My birthday this year.

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,720
We will live together,

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,100
without any decrease in the hallways.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
The song is about the love of the world

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
The song is about the love of the world

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
The song is about the love of the world

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
The song is about the love of the world

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
The song is about the love of the world

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
The song is about the love of the world

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
The song is about the love of the world

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
The song is about the love of the world

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
The song is about the love of the world

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The song is about the love of the world

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
The song is about the love of the world

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
The song is about the love of the world

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
The song is about the love of the world

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Happy new year

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
First, you' ke

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,660
Fantastic

37
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,500
They finished watching each other

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,840
everyone's со

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,020
Happy New Year

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,400
I have got the back of the moubei

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,100
I can see that he is quite gardening

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
in the past few days when my parents died.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
If my parents weren't killed by Qian Yin,

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
then they might still be alive, right?

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I was born into a demon group,

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
and chased after Qian Yin.

47
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
But I heard that she died from a deep hole in the demon group.

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Even the guards couldn't find her body.

49
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
How did you find her?

50
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Fulin told me.

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Fulin of Lengquan Palace?

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Why did you get involved with a demon girl?

53
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
In Nian'an City, I thought she was a human group.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
I saved her at that time.

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Nonsense!

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
How can a demon group believe in such a thing?

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
Besides, it's just a tombstone.

58
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,100
It must be of some other kind.

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Chong Zhao, I know that

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
you've been feeling bad about your parents' death.

61
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,100
But you're a disciple of Lan Ling.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
You should know that

63
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
the soul lamp is gone.

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
The life-saving power is gone.

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
The soul lamp is gone.

66
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
The soul lamp is gone.

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Besides, if they were still alive,

68
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
why would they leave you here

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
and never come back?

70
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
You should let go of this matter.

71
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
The sun rises in the east,

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
the moon sets in the east,

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
the snake-shaped grass rises up,

74
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,100
and the moon kills the sea.

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
The earth knows the sky,

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
and the land knows the land.

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
This is the same thing that happened in the Five Nights.

78
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I don't understand it at all.

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
The sun rises in the east,

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
the sun sets in the west,

81
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
the moon sets in the east,

82
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
the moon sets in the east,

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
the moon kills the sea.

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
The sun rises in the east,

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
the moon kills the sea.

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
The sun kills the sea.

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I thought the same.

88
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
If it's the sun,

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
the snake and the giant

90
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
will be the same.

91
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
What does snake and giant grass mean?

92
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
You don't live in the human race.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
It's normal.

94
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
This is a quote from the human race.

95
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
The human race?

96
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
In our race, there is a saying,

97
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
the snake and the earth's four are the opposite.

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Snake and giant grass are the four-shaped grass.

99
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Four, plus the upper half of the grass,

100
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
is the meaning of the one-way.

101
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
It's the meaning of the one-way.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
The Five Nights tells me

103
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
that this coin is the key to finding the one-way.

104
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Master,

105
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
we still have to eat the human race.

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
The snake in the desert is not strange.

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
But how does the fish in the fish-shape

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
kill the sea?

109
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Where does the fish come from?

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I haven't thought about it yet.

111
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
It seems that we have to go and see

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
the sea-line.

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

115
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

116
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

118
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

120
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

122
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

125
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

126
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
The sea-line is the one-way.

127
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
The sea-line.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
The sea-line is the one way.

129
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Just a village.

130
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Is it really?

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,100
No.

132
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
It is just a village.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
The fish-shape is the fish-shape.

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Look at the tail.

135
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
One fish-shape gets killed.

136
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Two fish-shape get鹿.

137
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Then what does Chewing laser mean?

138
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Maybe we have to go to where we were

139
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
then we would find clues.

140
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Where is the body of Yi Chen?

141
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
What's wrong?

142
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
It's strange that I can't tell you.

143
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I always feel that everything is too easy.

144
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
No!

145
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
It's a sandalwood!

146
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Don't stop!

147
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Catch it!

148
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Catch it!

149
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
The heart is beating!

150
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
I can't stand it anymore!

151
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Don't worry.

152
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
I won't let you get hurt.

153
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Don't stop!

154
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Stop!

155
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
The moon is shining on the sky.

156
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
The moon is shining on the sea.

157
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
The sky is full of clouds.

158
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
The sky is full of clouds.

159
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Fan Yuan, I know that...

160
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Stop!

161
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Who told you to let go of my hand?

162
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Because I found out...

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
What did you find out?

164
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Do you know that if you betray me,

165
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
you will die?

166
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
But you still followed me in.

167
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Do you believe in my betrayal

168
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
or that I will die?

169
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
But because I said that,

170
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
I won't let you die.

171
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Hand.

172
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
What are you doing?

173
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
What are you doing?

174
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I believe you.

175
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
I believe that you won't let me die.

176
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I always say that.

177
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Don't worry.

178
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
I won't let myself die either.

179
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Do you remember the last line?

180
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
The earth knows the sky,

181
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
but it doesn't enter the world.

182
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
This sentence is our answer to the earth.

183
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Only we can enter the world

184
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
and find the real way.

185
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
That's not the reason

186
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
why you let go of my hand.

187
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Your life is my life.

188
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Fan Yuan,

189
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
although I was the one who came down,

190
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
I still have to correct your words.

191
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I have always been your life.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Thank you for coming with me

193
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
to die together.

194
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Even if you are not here,

195
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I will save myself.

196
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
I think this is the town of Sha Zhen.

197
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
I feel that the entrance is right here.

198
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Hold this.

199
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Hold this.

200
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Follow me.

201
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Don't move or run.

202
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Maybe there will be a chance.

203
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I wonder why the Hall of Halls is so bright.

204
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
It's been seven years since the Yicheng's lock-down.

205
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
You are so good at it.

206
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
It's been seven years.

207
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
It doesn't mean that you don't want to ask about the truth.

208
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
The Hall of Halls is in the dead of danger.

209
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I have long been begging for the Great Ming.

210
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Since that,

211
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
the Sha Zhen

212
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
is the gift you gave me.

213
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
It's been a thousand years.

214
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
It's been a thousand years.

215
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
It's been a thousand years.

216
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
It's been a thousand years.

217
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
It's been a thousand years.

218
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
I am just a stranger.

219
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
This girl is very smart.

220
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
She is brave.

221
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
She can keep calm in life and death.

222
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
She is familiar with the rules of Sha Zhen.

223
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
I am very impressed.

224
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
I am not smart or smart.

225
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
I am not afraid of death.

226
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I just know that

227
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
there is another way to save yourself.

228
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
It's called saving yourself.

229
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
No wonder the Hall of Halls is so devoted to you.

230
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
I am here to tell you

231
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
that in three days,

232
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
you will be re-opened

233
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
by the Great Ming.

234
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Why?

235
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I think you should know that

236
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
there is no one in the Hall of Halls

237
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
who is willing to do anything.

238
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
If the King of the One-Eyes agrees,

239
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I can let Yicheng enter the Hall of Halls

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
and close the door.

241
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
But if he doesn't,

242
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
in three days,

243
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I think King of the One-Eyes

244
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
will not be able to come to Yicheng.

245
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Li,

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Bing,

247
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
are all in front of you.

248
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Let's see how King of the One-Eyes will decide.

249
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Your Majesty,

250
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
the King of the One-Eyes

251
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
agreed to accept the Five-Eyes of the same person

252
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
to get the respect of the two-Eyes of the First and the First.

253
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
It's fair.

254
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
But we have been holding the Five-Eyes for thousands of years

255
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
and have been trying our best.

256
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
But we still can't see the two-Eyes of the First and the First.

257
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
If we re-opened the Five-Eyes,

258
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
the people of the city will only be more willing to come.

259
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
The Hall of Halls came here

260
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
and started to give me the conditions

261
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
to protect the city.

262
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
It seems to be a good idea.

263
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
But I don't know

264
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
if the real intention of the Hall of Halls

265
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
is to make it clear.

266
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I don't know what the situation is.

267
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
But Yicheng has already exposed it.

268
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,100
It's impossible for Yicheng to make it in three days.

269
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
If the two-Eyes of the First and the First

270
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
will know that I am in Yicheng,

271
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
the secret in the city

272
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
will never be hidden.

273
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
No matter whether you agree or not,

274
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
it's all a problem.

275
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Yicheng.

276
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Zhenyu?

277
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
It's been years.

278
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Is this your way of treating guests?

279
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Zhenyu,

280
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
how did you find this place?

281
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Is it hard?

282
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
I want to find the place where Fan Yue can find it.

283
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
But I can't.

284
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
What do you want to do here?

285
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Why do you have to be so cautious?

286
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
I came here today

287
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
to help Yicheng.

288
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
You want to keep the secret.

289
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
I can help you.

290
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Your trouble

291
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
can also be solved by you.

292
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I can help you solve it.

293
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Everything is in the market.

294
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
What do you want?

295
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Hurry up.

296
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
You should have heard

297
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
about the Five-Eyes Stone.

298
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Zhang Bai,

299
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
are you going to attack the Great Court?

300
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
It's all my idea.

301
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Danding, Danding.

302
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Sit down.

303
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Okay.

304
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Today,

305
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm here to tell you something else.

306
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
The King of the One-Eyes Stone

307
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
sent a invitation

308
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
to invite the two-Eyes Stone

309
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
to Yicheng.

310
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
They re-organized the Five-Eyes Stone.

311
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
It's the relationship

312
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
between the two-Eyes Stone and the One-Eyes Stone.

313
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
The Five-Eyes Stone hasn't been opened for seven years.

314
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
They just want to open it.

315
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
They don't want to open it.

316
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Then we should be the monkey.

317
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
I'm not going.

318
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
That's right.

319
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
The King of the One-Eyes Stone

320
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
has been taking the Five-Eyes Stone for seven years.

321
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
It's causing more fighting

322
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
between the two-Eyes Stone and the One-Eyes Stone.

323
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
The first-born child is like Yicheng.

324
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
He will fight with the demons.

325
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
We, the Blue-Eyes Stone,

326
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
don't need to take this stone.

327
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Don't be anxious to oppose it.

328
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Let me finish my words.

329
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
The winner of the Five-Eyes Stone

330
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
will get the same reward.

331
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Why did you forget about it?

332
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
If you say so,

333
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
you can really think about it.

334
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
The world is a world of spirits.

335
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
It can increase the level of the disciples.

336
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Even if we don't need it,

337
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
we can sell it to others.

338
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
It's enough for us to eat the Blue-Eyes Stone for three years.

339
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
What three years?

340
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Ten years is enough.

341
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Since we don't have any doubts,

342
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
we should take the King of the One-Eyes Stone.

343
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Yes, Master.

344
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
This...

345
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Don't worry.

346
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I didn't forget about the Five-Eyes Stone.

347
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
This time,

348
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
the Five-Eyes Stone is not only received by the Immortal Sect,

349
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
but also by the Demon Sect,

350
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
such as the Great Moon Palace,

351
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
and the Demon Sect,

352
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
and the Golden Mountain.

353
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
To be honest,

354
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I want to be stronger.

355
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
I think I will join the battle.

356
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,100
But we have to take the stone with us.

357
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
It's not as simple as

358
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
finding it in the prison.

359
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Then I'll go.

360
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I'll be more patient.

361
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Go, go, go.

362
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I'll be more patient.

363
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
The One-Eyes Stone has a spiritual formation.

364
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
No matter how strong the Immortal Sect is,

365
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
if it's in the city,

366
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
it can't be used as a magic force.

367
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
It can only be used as a full-fledged skill.

368
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
So, you or Chongzhao

369
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
can't be different.

370
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Chongzhao,

371
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
the Five-Eyes Stone is not

372
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
a simple battle stone.

373
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
It's a combination of

374
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
physical strength,

375
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
intelligence,

376
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
and mental balance.

377
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
So, you must be

378
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
in danger in this battle.

379
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Remember,

380
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
it's important to protect the same door

381
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
when you bring back the White Shower.

382
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I understand.

383
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,100
This is the Immortal Cang Xuan Sword.

384
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
It's very useful

385
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
in the key moment of the Hundred-Year Sword Soul.

386
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Thank you, master.

387
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
I didn't say I would give it to you.

388
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
It's useful.

389
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Take it.

390
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Thank you, master.

391
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
The King of Yiren is also a true person.

392
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
He can't hide.

393
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
He's open to the public.

394
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
The King of Yiren is very thoughtful.

395
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
He's a good-looking.

396
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Although the Hall Leader has broken the barrier,

397
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
the gate is still open.

398
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
As long as the gate is open,

399
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
no matter if it's a conspiracy or a trick,

400
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
the Hall will be sealed.

401
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
The King of Yiren

402
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Master,

403
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
the King of Yiren has already made a lot of mistakes

404
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
and made a lot of mistakes.

405
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
It's too much.

406
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
If you want to eat, you must take it.

407
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
The game is over.

408
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
The game is over.

409
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Even if they are fighting,

410
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
what will happen if they eat?

411
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
In the end,

412
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
the King of Yiren will still beat them.

413
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
But

414
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,100
the King of Yiren will die.

415
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Where did he come from?

416
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Let's go.

417
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
It's gone.

418
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Let's go home.

419
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Let's go home.

420
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
This is Yicheng.

421
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
It's really a great place to be.

422
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
These Yiren are really strong.

423
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
They are really powerful.

424
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
They don't seem to welcome us.

425
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Yiren and Xianyao have been together for thousands of years.

426
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Xianyao is a Yiren.

427
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Yiren is a Yemu Xianyao.

428
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Don't leave the Hall in this Yicheng.

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
It's useless if you die.

430
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
You'd better do it yourself.

431
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Yicheng is already open.

432
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
The Fairy School is coming soon.

433
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
You stole the Yicheng's Yiren.

434
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
What if Xianzu comes?

435
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
It's still the same.

436
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Even if we don't come in,

437
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
we won't be afraid of Xianzu.

438
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Xianling?

439
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
In Yicheng,

440
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Xianyao can't use magic.

441
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Then it's called Wuyi Yan.

442
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
There are knives and knives.

443
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
You can use them to fight.

444
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
So in Yicheng,

445
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,100
you can only use weapons and fists to fight?

446
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Xianyao can't use magic.

447
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Then my victory is a lot.

448
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Don't think too much.

449
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
Even if you don't use magic,

450
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I'll take you with me.

451
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
You're overthinking.

452
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Uncle.

453
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Why are you here?

454
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
He's the one in the Hall.

455
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Can you control him?

456
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Uncle, you shouldn't be with the Demon Clan.

457
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
This is not the place you should come.

458
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I don't care who I should come with.

459
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
I have my own decision.

460
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
The Demon Clan is not trustworthy.

461
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
We're not here to fight.

462
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Us?

463
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Then even if we are,

464
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
don't stand by and think it through.

465
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
We should believe it.

466
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I have something to do.

467
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
The Immortal Sect can't give me what I want.

468
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
We're not destined to be together.

469
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Let's go.

470
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Okay.

471
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
The Immortals have arrived.

472
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
They're all here.

473
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
How can we miss the Wutong Five-Six?

474
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,100
How can we miss the Cold Spring Palace?

475
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Fu Ling.

476
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Go to Yicheng.

477
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Do as the plan says.

478
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Keep an eye on Bai Shuo.

479
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Don't let her go out of Yicheng.

480
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Understood.

481
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Master.

482
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Send Fu Ling to go.

483
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm not afraid of Chongzhao becoming his spy.

484
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
It will ruin your plan.

485
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I have no right to keep a few more backpacks.

486
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
That's it.

487
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,100
Master has sent others to Yicheng?

488
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
I'm a kind person.

489
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
As long as I can use them,

490
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
anyone can be my pawn.

491
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Master.

492
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Master.

493
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Master.

494
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Master.

495
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
What's wrong with him?

496
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Fu Ling.

497
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
We're the ones who took the pawn.

498
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
We're the old people.

499
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Master.

500
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm going to kill you.

501
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Don't be so serious.

502
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
How dare you?

503
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
I'll see you out.

504
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Are you okay?

505
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Stop fighting.

506
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Come on.

507
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Master.

508
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
It seems that

509
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
it's the five-year-old Yu Yan who is becoming a spy again.

510
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Is it because of the evil

511
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
that he's been fighting with the Xianyao Sect?

512
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Master.

513
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Come on.

514
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Stop fighting.

515
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Enough.

516
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Stop fighting.

517
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Stop fighting.

518
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Let's go.

519
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
What are you talking about?

520
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Master.

521
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Master.

522
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
The Tianzi House

523
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
should belong to the Xian Clan.

524
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
You're all so far away.

525
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
You're always wandering around.

526
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I wonder if I can help you.

527
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
Do you want to help Mao Keng?

528
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
What are you talking about?

529
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Let's go.

530
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Let's go.

531
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Enough.

532
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
What you said is

533
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
you, the evil Yu Yan.

534
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Beichen.

535
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
You're talking about something.

536
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
Didn't you have a quarrel

537
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
with the Hu Clan?

538
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Are you dumb today?

539
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Let me say something.

540
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Stop it.

541
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I want to say

542
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
that the immortal has a cloud

543
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
and everything is clear.

544
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Who?

545
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
As the immortal's gift,

546
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
he's not good at thinking.

547
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
He's a good at drawing.

548
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
It's clear.

549
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Don't make a fuss.

550
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Come on.

551
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Let's read it together.

552
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,100
The Imperial Descendant of the Great Great.

553
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
What's the gift?

554
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
I can't stand

555
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
the Xian Clan.

556
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
What else can I say?

557
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
What are you talking about?

558
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
What are you talking about?

559
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
What are you talking about?

560
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
What are you talking about?

561
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
What are you talking about?

562
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
We're here

563
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
for Wu Tong and Wu Yan.

564
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Why do you have to fight for Wei Xiang?

565
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
I'll fight for you.

566
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Kunlun, you're the most cunning one.

567
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
You're the most talented one.

568
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Since the immortal has a cloud,

569
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
why do you have to fight for one thing?

570
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
This is the tradition of Wu Tong and Wu Yan.

571
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Back then, the Emperor had three clans.

572
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
He and the Immortal were the kings.

573
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,100
The immortal and the demon were the rules.

574
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
I think it's a set of rules.

575
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
As long as the position is different,

576
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
no matter what,

577
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
the fight is not a problem.

578
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Great.

579
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
It's clear that you're the girls.

580
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Immortal, demon,

581
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
no one is better than you.

582
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
The government is not as good as me.

583
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Don't fight with the demons.

584
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
There are only a few rooms.

585
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
What's the good thing about it?

586
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Lan Ling and Zhu Zuo are not saved.

587
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Please listen to me.

588
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Save?

589
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Who am I?

590
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Isn't this

591
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
the King of Chongzhao

592
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,100
who can't even guard Ning'an?

593
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
What's Lan Ling's way of guarding?

594
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
You're so incompetent.

595
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
You're so chaotic.

596
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
If I were you,

597
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
I would have been hiding in the cave.

598
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Why are you still here?

599
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
You're not even fighting with the Immortal.

600
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Lan Ling,

601
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
what are you talking about?

602
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
If you don't want to fight with the demons,

603
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
do you want to fight with them?

604
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Yes.

605
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
You have the power to fight.

606
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
You don't want to guard the people.

607
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
You're so brave and brave.

608
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
You're the immortal.

609
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
You're a small man.

610
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
How dare you teach me?

611
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
I'll kill you.

612
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
I'll kill you.

613
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Senior.

614
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
You were so quick to get the right person.

615
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
With a world like yours,

616
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
if you don't come to use it,

617
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
you won't get the Thunderbolt.

618
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Are you okay?

619
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Who are you?

620
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Put your name on it.

621
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
I forgot to tell you.

622
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
I have the power to guard the Heavens.

623
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Why are you doing this?

624
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Senior.

625
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Senior.

626
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Senior.

627
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Senior.

628
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
You're so weak.

629
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
You're so weak.

630
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
You're so weak.

631
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
You're so weak.

632
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
You're so weak.

633
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
You're so weak.

634
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
You're so weak.

635
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
You're so weak.

636
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
What's that smell?

637
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Nothing.

638
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
I just think

639
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
it's a good feeling

640
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
to have a kind of strong aura.

641
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I can keep it up.

642
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
I don't need to

643
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
use it for a long time.

644
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Kill them!

645
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Kill them!

646
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Kill them!

647
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Kill them!

648
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Kill them!

649
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Kill them!

650
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Kill them!

651
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Kill them!

652
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Kill them!

653
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Kill them!

654
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Kill them!

655
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Kill them!

656
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Kill them!

657
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Kill them!

658
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,220
Kill them! Kill them!

659
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Kill them! Kill them!

660
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,860
Kill them! Kill them!

661
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,380
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

662
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,820
Brother, you are...

663
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Who are you, brother?

664
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
There's nothing good about the Immortality Demons.

665
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,180
It's all because of you.

666
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,780
You're the ones who took the sick to the city.

667
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,820
All of you must die!

668
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
Kill them! Kill them!

669
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Kill them! Kill them!

670
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,020
The sick?

671
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,060
Kill them! Kill them!

672
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,620
Brother, what's wrong with this kid?

673
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,380
I'm afraid it's not a normal illness.

674
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
Don't talk nonsense with them!

675
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,740
They are the Immortality Demons.

676
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,300
They killed every single one of us!

677
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,740
They killed them all!

678
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,780
The kids are saved!

679
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,740
Right?

680
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,700
We are all the children.

681
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,380
You all are so quiet.

682
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,060
All right, all right.

683
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,100
One person is always the one to see.

684
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,500
You...

685
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,420
What are you saying?

686
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,020
They are here to join us.

687
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,860
It's okay if they don't come.

688
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,220
They dare to give us a signal.

689
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,420
All right.

690
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,420
Come on.

691
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,260
I want to see how you can take our medicine.

692
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,860
Kill them! Kill them!

693
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,900
Kill them!

694
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,620
Kill them!

695
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
I think it's true.

696
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm not good at fighting.

697
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,340
I think the sick is better than the sick.

698
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
Don't talk nonsense with them.

699
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,260
Come on!

700
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,460
Hurry up!

701
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,580
Hu!

702
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,780
Hu!

703
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,540
Hu, wake up!

704
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,580
Hu!

705
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,140
Uncle Wang,

706
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,580
hurry up and report to the group.

707
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,700
If you die here,

708
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,980
what else can you do?

709
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,260
I haven't made it to the end yet.

710
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,180
I'm not good at fighting.

711
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,540
Hu!

712
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,300
Hu!

713
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,420
Kunlun is good at medical skills.

714
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,100
How can she know?

715
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,860
I've never seen a patient like this.

716
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,060
Why are you still standing there?

717
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,180
Hurry up and report to the group.

718
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,540
Don't go to the meeting place.

719
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,820
I knew

720
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,740
you had no good things to do.

721
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,860
Get out of here!

722
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,900
Get out!

723
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,020
Get out!

724
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,300
Get out!

725
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,580
Get out!

726
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,700
Get out!

727
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,060
Get out!

728
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,740
Hu!

729
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,660
Hu!

730
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,860
Hu, hold on.

731
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,740
Uncle Wang.

732
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,940
Hu!

733
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,900
Hu!

734
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
Hu!

735
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,900
Hu!

736
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,700
Don't sleep.

737
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Don't sleep, Hu!

738
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,300
Hu, wake up.

739
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,500
Hu, wake up.

740
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,940
Hold on.

741
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,060
Hu!

742
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,660
Hu!

743
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,260
Hu, wake up.

744
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,980
Hu!

745
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,620
Don't sleep.

746
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,500
Don't sleep.

747
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,860
Hu!

748
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,700
Wake up, Hu!

749
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
Why do you want to give him?

750
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,460
I'm a human group.

751
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,660
Not a fairy or a demon.

752
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,860
This demon can save the child.

753
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,620
Even if you're a human group,

754
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,300
you'll be with the fairy and demon.

755
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,220
You'll be with them for a while.

756
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,260
Believe it or not,

757
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,700
it's my word.

758
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,900
It's not a good thing to save him.

759
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,100
It's not a good thing to save him.

760
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,460
It's the child's life.

761
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,380
It's the enemy of the fairy and demon.

762
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,500
You choose.

763
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,800
Hu!

764
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,880
hmm

765
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
hmm

766
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,400
Didn't expect that he would become like this.

767
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,540
He really turned his back on us and died slowly.

768
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,200
Again?

769
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,800
I knew later,

770
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,060
I'd missed someone better than his own father.

771
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,120
You think so?

772
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,420
Aren't you feeling better?

773
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,000
dogs you know have great discipline.

774
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
Let's take a look.

775
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,420
There's blood going to run on your ears,

776
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah.

777
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,220
Look!

778
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
It's me!

779
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
It's me!

780
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
It's me!

781
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
It's me!

782
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
It's me!

783
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,920
You're not out of the world!

784
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
It's me!

785
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
It's me!

786
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,920
Why not?

787
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
What's going on?

788
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
It's on his hand!

789
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
What's going on?

790
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
It's really on his hand!

791
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
It's really on his hand!

792
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Look!

793
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Look!

794
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
What's going on?

795
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
What's going on?

796
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
What's going on?

797
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
What's going on?

798
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Wait!

799
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
What are you doing?

800
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
What are you doing?

801
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
It's a fire!

802
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
I saw it!

803
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
Senior, look at this!

804
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Maybe it's because Bai Shuo saved one child.

805
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
The fire is coming from the heart.

806
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
What a nonsense!

807
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Maybe it's because of the people's words.

808
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,920
How can you get the fire with just one medicine?

809
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
This is cheating!

810
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
It's cheating!

811
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
It's not a fire!

812
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
You can take it first or the demon!

813
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Anyway, it's not allowed!

814
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
It's not allowed!

815
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
It's not allowed!

816
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Why can't the human group take the fire?

817
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
The demon is a monster.

818
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
The human family is not qualified to participate.

819
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Really?

820
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,920
In this city, I am his right.

821
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I don't deserve to be a soldier.

822
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
You all came to the city.

823
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,420
Why are you so stubborn?

824
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I am Wu Zhao, the father of Prince Yi.

825
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Welcome all of you to my city.

826
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
You are all here for nothing.

827
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
You are right.

828
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I want to ask him

829
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,920
what is the right thing to do in a human group?

830
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Before the entrance of the Hall of Fame,

831
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
we have passed the message to Prince Yi.

832
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,920
There will be a group of people who will join the three of us.

833
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
The King is the King of Yin.

834
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
The King of Yin is the King of Yin.

835
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
The King of Yin is the King of Yin.

836
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
The King of Yin is the King of Yin.

837
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
You are right.

838
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,420
The Hall of Fame.

839
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
The Hall of Fame?

840
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,420
The Hall of Fame?

841
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
The Hall of Fame?

842
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
How did you know?

843
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Wu Tong, Wu Yan.

844
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
From the moment you all entered the city,

845
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
you have already started.

846
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Three new fires.

847
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
One, the second, the third.

848
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,420
The first two new fires are all self-made.

849
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
The fire is self-made.

850
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,420
Only the third fire

851
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,920
is made by the King and the two of the first demons.

852
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,420
In Fen Lan Bay,

853
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
there are two kinds of fire.

854
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,920
The final one is the third fire.

855
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,420
It is the Holy Fire of Wu Tong Wu Yan.

856
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
It can be obtained by Wu Tong Ling Dan.

857
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,920
This is the rule of Wu Yan for a thousand years.

858
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,920
This is also the answer that the late emperor wanted.

859
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
The fire is made by the new fire.

860
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
No one can control it.

861
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,420
The first demons are waiting for the first to enter the city.

862
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,920
Wu Zhao is here to help you.

863
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,420
You are welcome to return.

864
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Come up.

865
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Who is it?

866
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Uncle.

867
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,920
Senior, let's join in.

868
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Okay.

869
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Brother, the three demons are the best.

870
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
They are the best in the Hall of Merit.

871
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
What do you think we should do?

872
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
If it's not right,

873
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
we should offend this one.

874
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
But if it's right,

875
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,420
we should offend the two of Jing You Mountain and Leng Quan Palace.

876
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
We should focus more.

877
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
The more we focus, the better.

878
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Anyway, we are here to join Wu Yan, right?

879
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
Yes.

880
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Don't ask.

881
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Yes.

882
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,420
Don't ask.

883
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Don't ask.

884
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,420
But why does the Hall of Merit have to bring a human to enter the city?

885
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
What else can I say?

886
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
Don't ask. Don't ask.

887
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Do you understand?

888
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Yes. Don't ask. Don't ask.

889
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
Absolutely not.

890
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,420
Go.

891
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Go.

892
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Don't you think that everything is going well?

893
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
The first demon entered the city,

894
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
and it didn't even eat hot food.

895
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
He met a child and got sick.

896
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
He came to apologize to the people.

897
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
He was so happy.

898
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
He seemed to have been arranged in advance.

899
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Continue.

900
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,420
Then I saved that child and got the first star.

901
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,420
I said that the star owner was not allowed to touch him.

902
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,420
But how do I feel that

903
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,420
someone deliberately sent the star to me?

904
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
You're right.

905
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,420
I have to listen to you not to praise me.

906
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
The first star was sent to you

907
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,420
so that you can become the important place of the first demon and the second demon.

908
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
You will be watched by everyone.

909
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
No matter who the person who was secretly sent is,

910
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
the game has already started.

911
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,920
And it's more interesting than I thought.

912
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,920
This is not a conspiracy. It's a conspiracy.

913
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Look, the other party was sent to you.

914
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
But the truth is

915
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
it was sent by the Five-Nin Master.

916
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Five-Nin Master again?

917
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
It seems that I can only act as the main character.

918
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,920
If someone really treats me, I will surely act behind my back.

919
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
How was it?

920
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I saved the first king's life at least.

921
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Is that how you treat someone who saved Ming-en?

922
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
You are the demon and I am the first.

923
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
We are both in different directions.

924
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I will investigate the truth of my parents' death.

925
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,920
If you want to find out the truth, you have to use the demons as your accomplices.

926
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Then my parents will not be at peace.

927
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
I will be at ease.

928
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Lord Chengzhao,

929
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
do you remember what you said today?

930
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
What do you want in the future?

931
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
I will steal from you.

932
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
You are not my only one.

933
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
I will see how long you can last.

934
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Get out of here.

935
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Don't force me to do it.

936
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
You are the one who should leave.

937
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
What do you mean?

938
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Don't worry, I didn't remind you.

939
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
It's dangerous.

940
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Don't let Lan Ling's old friends

941
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
send the black person to the white one.

942
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Chongzhao, it's me.

943
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Get out of here.

944
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
What?

945
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Are you worried that I will be found by Bai Shou?

946
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Or...

947
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
you should explain to Bai Shou yourself.

948
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Get out of here.

949
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
What's that sound?

950
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
A cat.

951
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Shuo,

952
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
are you willing to go back to the Fairy Tribe with me?

953
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I came here to ask

954
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
how is the old lady after I left?

955
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
She's fine.

956
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
She only has 100 big burdens

957
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
for every month.

958
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Did she suffer anything else?

959
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
No.

960
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
She's fine.

961
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Shuo.

962
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
You and I have nothing else to say.

963
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
What else can you say between us?

964
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
I've said it before.

965
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
We're not the same person.

966
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
If it's really a secret,

967
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
why did you come to help me?

968
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
We've been together for ten years.

969
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
You've been a weak person

970
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
to hide your identity.

971
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
It seems like

972
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
you've become my habit.

973
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I forgot again.

974
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
You're Lan Ling's fairy.

975
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
I don't need to help you.

976
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Shuo.

977
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
When I heard something

978
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
during Lan Ling's time,

979
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
I knew you were doing this for my safety.

980
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
I also knew you had a 300-page account.

981
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
But I couldn't thank you

982
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
for the charge.

983
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Then,

984
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
do you hate me?

985
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
No.

986
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
You didn't poison my father.

987
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
You didn't force him to die.

988
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
You just risked your life

989
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
to save me.

990
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
You almost ruined my life

991
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
after all that.

992
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Have you ever thought

993
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
that even if I'm alive,

994
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
you'll let me know

995
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
what to do after all this?

996
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
It's all my fault.

997
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
I was too confident

998
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
to give the demon clan a chance.

999
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm sorry.

1000
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
But I...

1001
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I really didn't think

1002
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
that I'd end up like that.

1003
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I know that all of that

1004
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
is not your intention.

1005
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
So I don't want to blame you anymore.

1006
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Then,

1007
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
can we go back to the past?

1008
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
I've already finished

1009
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
all of your safety.

1010
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
You're no longer

1011
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
that little brat.

1012
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm no longer

1013
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
that little baby after the heaven and earth.

1014
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
I'll walk on my own

1015
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
in the future.

1016
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,920
You're the same.

1017
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Uncle.

1018
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Then, you and Fan Yuan

1019
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
are now...

1020
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
what's the relationship between us?

1021
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
He and I need

1022
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Wu Nian Shi's power

1023
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
and cooperation.

1024
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,920
I think he's always protecting you.

1025
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
What he's protecting

1026
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
is Wu Nian Shi.

1027
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
We've been talking for a long time.

1028
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
You're so stubborn.

1029
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
You're so obedient.

1030
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm not going to do this.

1031
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
You can ask him

1032
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
whatever you want to ask.

1033
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
I don't need to listen to him.

1034
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
You think you know me?

1035
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
At least, you're shorter than him.

1036
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
If you can't remember,

1037
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
don't waste your time

1038
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
on any injuries.

1039
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
It's late night.

1040
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
It's time to go to the city for a visit.

1041
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,840
Pin Ng

1042
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,520
Don't be afraid, my heart will only be yours

1043
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:28,320
Come, come

1044
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:36,320
My heart is so excited

1045
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Wait for me

1046
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,720
My heart is so excited

1047
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,720
You are the light I want to see

1048
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,720
You are the only way

1049
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,720
I want to be with you

1050
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,720
I want to be with you

1051
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,720
I want to be with you

1052
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,720
You are the blue soil of my life

1053
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,720
I want to be with you

1054
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,720
I want to be with you

1055
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:40,720
I want to be with you

1056
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,720
I want to be with you
