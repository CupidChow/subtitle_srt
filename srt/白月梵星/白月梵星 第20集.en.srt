1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,990
[Episode 20]

19
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,790
Thank you for your help, Grand Master.

20
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,170
If it weren't for you, Grand Master,

21
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,700
I, Chen Ye, would have been killed by Jing Lei.

22
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,080
Being humble

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,330
doesn't seem

24
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,580
to match you well.

25
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,670
You knew for a fact

26
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,020
that I won't let you die,

27
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,160
That's why you dared to

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,060
head to the Cold Spring Palace.

29
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,140
Originally, if we kill a few more humans,

30
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,020
the evil insect could have been transmuted.

31
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,180
Unfortunately,

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,490
the old guy in Lanling interrupted me.

33
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,320
Enough.

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,079
The Supreme Eternal

35
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,770
came in person to capture you.

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,930
You're considered prestigious now.

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,970
But don't you think it's strange, Grand Master?

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,030
We've been very careful.

39
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,500
How could he know it in advance?

40
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,940
Besides,

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,750
how could he recognise

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,840
that I'm from the Cold Spring Palace?

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,410
Unless...

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Chong Zhao is also from Lanling.

45
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,410
It's about time

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,030
the both of them return.

47
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,130
Why are you still here?

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,090
I didn't hurt the people from the Fox Clan.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Shuo.

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,459
I should have told you some things earlier.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,329
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,779
So are you going to tell me

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,920
why you entered the Cold Spring Palace?

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,580
If I say it's for Lanling,

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,330
would you believe me?

56
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,350
Young Lord,

57
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,340
Chong Zhao went to find Bai Shuo again.

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop helping him, Young Lord.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,380
Master will punish you severely when we're back.

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,230
Perhaps,

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,310
he might even kill you.

62
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,280
Don't worry.

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,610
Until the last moment,

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,170
I may not necessarily lose.

65
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,280
Young Master, you have an idea?

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,360
The incident with Emotion Tree

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
is sufficient to hault Fan Yue.

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
We just need to find a chance to kill Bai Shuo.

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,060
Just that...

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,090
Just that Chong Zhao likes Bai Shuo so much.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,540
He must hate you till death.

72
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,000
This is unfair.

73
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,660
Young Lord, stop liking him.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,820
He is not good at all.

75
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,330
-Xixi hates him.
-You’re right.

76
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,580
So this time

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,850
will be the last time I help him.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
My feelings ripple,

79
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,420
but I dare to attempt reversing the river's flow.

80
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,870
I can't control my heart

81
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,670
because it doesn't hurt enough.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
It should hurt deep into my bones;

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,850
hurt so much that I fear;

84
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,200
hurt so much that whenever I think of the torture,

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,850
I no longer dare to waver.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,030
This way,

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,710
my feelings for him

88
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,140
will be suppressed.

89
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,390
Young...

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,400
Young Master, what do you plan to do?

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
To kill Bai Shuo,

92
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,860
which is also to bring an end

93
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,300
to my feelings.

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,380
You investigated the Cold Spring for Lanling.

95
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,590
That's not odd.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,040
But the Cold Spring Palace

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,120
treats other Eternals very harshly.

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,280
How did they come to trust you?

99
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,390
It's probably because of Fu Ling.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,290
She wanted me to become a demon.

101
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,880
So she may have said a lot of good words to Zhen Yu.

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,860
Become a demon?

103
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,330
You're an Eternal.

104
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,550
How can you become a demon?

105
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,320
Through practicing the techniques of the Demon Race?

106
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,520
It's complicated.

107
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,780
Anyway,

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,350
given our relationship,

109
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,330
Zhen Yu wanted to use me to capture you to the Cold Spring.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,530
All the more you shouldn't return then.

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,640
They didn't manage to catch me at the Jingyou Mountain this time.

112
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,370
Zhen Yu won't let you go easily.

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,290
You should back to Lanling now.

114
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,740
With Sect Leader Jin Yao,

115
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,950
you'll be safe.

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,750
I would be. But what about you?

117
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,610
There are so many demons in the Cold Spring Palace.

118
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,610
Zhen Yu is determined to get the Contemplation Stone.

119
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,520
Even if he didn't send me, he would send someone else.

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
Only when I'm around,

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,310
it is safer for you.

122
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,310
Chong Zhao,

123
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,350
you should walk your own path.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,230
What do you mean?

125
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,640
I know

126
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,520
you feel guilty

127
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,070
for what happened to my father at Ning'an City,

128
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,000
that is why you always put me first.

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
But you don't have to do that.

130
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,370
Aren't you and I

131
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,280
always like this?

132
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,540
Yes.

133
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,100
You have been like this since you were young.

134
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,140
You took the blame when I caused trouble.

♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

173
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,960
Eternals and demons live a thousand,

174
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
and deities live on forever.

♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

176
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,000
It's already so hard to be a human.

177
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,700
How much harder it is

178
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,830
♫Layer after layer♫

179
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,980
to be an Eternal or even a deity?

180
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,270
I understand.

181
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,410
♫Another year passed♫

182
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,190
So in Ning'an City,

183
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,330
I chose to hide it from you

184
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,320
because I didn't want you to get entangled in this mess.

185
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,350
Now I choose to tell you everything

186
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,880
because I've figured it out.

187
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,940
No matter what happens in the future,

188
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,570
I will walk the path with you.

189
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,040
But your journey

190
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,400
shouldn't have been troubled in the first place.

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,190
Chong Zhao.

192
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,990
You were meant to be a sword-wielding

193
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,230
and justice-defending Lanling Eternal.

194
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't ruin you life

195
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,440
because of me.

196
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,720
You joined Cold Spring Palace as a spy was out of righteousness.

197
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,909
But I hope

198
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,610
you can also protect yourself.

199
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,360
If you know the road ahead is a dead end,

200
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,570
you should turn around quickly.

201
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,940
Don't sacrifice for nothing,

202
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,230
especially for me.

203
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,170
But your safety

204
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,440
is my wish.

205
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,940
That's too much for me to handle.

206
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,000
But it's fine when it comes to Fan Yue?

207
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,090
Just because both of you have to collect Contemplation,

208
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,850
you can walk the same path?

209
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,560
It's because I like him.

210
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,940
It's because I like him.

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,810
In the past,

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,850
we were childhood friends.

229
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,370

I didn't even know what love is.

I want to talk to you, Master

254
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,230
about the Weak Water Stone.

255
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,430
Auntie told me everything.

256
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,420
I want to make a deal with you.

257
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,670
I'll give you the Weak Water Stone,

258
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,330
and you'll go and save Ms. Bai.

259
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,810
But I ask Master

260
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,200
to protect Auntie for me.

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,630
You will die if the Weak Water Stone leaves your body.

262
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,600
I know.

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
So,

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,420
I hope you don't tell Tian Huo about this.

265
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,290
I can't.

266
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
I don’t agree.

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,430
I don't want to take advantage of others.

268
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,630
If Bai Shuo were here, she also wouldn’t.

269
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,830
And there's Tian Huo.

270
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,240
She finally have feelings for someone after all these years.

271
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,470
What would happen to her when you die?

272
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,660
But for you, Master,

273
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,450
there is no other choice.

274
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,320
If Ms. Bai died,

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,470
what would happen to you?

276
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,740
I will think of other ways.

277
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,200
If there were so many ways,

278
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,440
you wouldn't have

279
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,640
spent so much time in Jingyou Mountain.

280
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,350
My life, Mu Jiu's,

281
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,600
was saved by Ms. Bai and Master

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,260
from the realm of resentment.

283
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,740
Returning it now

284
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,710
is considered a worthwhile death.

285
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Bai Shuo and I only gave you a start.

286
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,960
Your life was given by your aunt.

287
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
Precisely.

288
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,620
All the more reason I can't let Auntie die because of me.

289
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,770
Rong Xian killed people from the Fox Clan,

290
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,030
hence the Fox Clan resented Linglong.

291
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,580
Linglong has been cursed for years,

292
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,700
so Auntie resented the Fox Clan

293
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,380
and sent Qi to death,

294
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,070
at the same time sacrificed her own life.

295
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,340
Guilt,

296
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,890
hatred,

297
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,660
and resent.

298
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,450
These are things that are endless.

299
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,430
One loop after another,

300
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,390
one step chasing the next,

301
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,250
it goes on forever without an end.

302
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
If someone has to end it,

303
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,330
the most suitable person is me.

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,710
So,

305
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,760
you do this to fulfill everyone's wish

306
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,140
and end all tragedies?

307
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,870
Master,

308
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,540
you word it too altruistically.

309
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,160
I am

310
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,500
just a little fox

311
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,730
who was lucky to earn a chance to live.

312
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,490
I was born with a shocking background,

313
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,150
have been receiving the deepest and most profound protection,

314
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,600
and even became

315
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,900
the Master of a mountain,

316
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,300
and had a moment of glory.

317
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,630
The luckiest thing

318
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,640
was to have met a girl whom I love,

319
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,830
and she happens to like me too.

320
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,010
Ordinary people might be fortunate to have one or two,

321
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,810
but I, Mu Jiu, have achieved them all.

322
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,810
It's worthwhile!

323
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,930
Fan Yue.

324
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,490
Can I call you that?

325
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,860
In my body,

326
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,530
there is the power you left in me that had changed my fate.

327
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,570
It has been kept for a thousand years.

328
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,100
It was then nourished by the Weak Water Stone,

329
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,880
enough to extend the lifespan of the Emotion Tree by thousands of years.

330
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,100
When the Weak Water Stone is handed over to Ms. Bai,

331
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
I request you

332
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,900
to bury the remaining power under the Emotion Tree.

333
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
However,

334
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,660
extracting its power

335
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,980
is another life-risking act.

336
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,370
It's very dangerous.

337
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,990
Are you willing to help me?

338
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,430
There's a saying among the Human Race,

339
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,990
"unfamiliar at first, but more familiar after a second encounter."

340
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,800
Master...

341
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,230
I...

342
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,580
Will do my best.

343
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,550
You don’t address yourself as Master anymore?

344
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,620
Are you

345
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,150
acknowledging me?

346
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,010
About Tian Huo...

347
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,600
I'll say goodbye to her properly.

348
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,860
She deserves better.

349
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,360
Don't touch it.

350
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,390
Behave yourself.

351
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,960
This is the evil insect

352
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,350
that caused the bloodshed among the Human Race?

353
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,140
Yes.

354
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,020
I personally intercepted this in Ning'an City.

355
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,280
Otherwise, the new governor Bai Yu

356
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,370
would have died.

357
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,090
It seems like Chong Zhao's letter was right.

358
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,570
The Cold Spring Palace

359
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,760
is indeed cultivating evil insects.

360
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,760
Many cities

361
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,040
have been implicated.

362
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,270
I'm afraid it won't be long till the birth

363
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
of these evil insects.

364
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,170
This is not an ordinary evil insect.

365
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,980
Is there any way to restrain it?

366
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,270
It takes time to find a way to restrain it.

367
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,920
I'm afraid that before we discover it,

368
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,580
there would already be a mess.

369
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,700
I will send a message to Chong Zhao.

370
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,130
No matter what,

371
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,760
we must stop everything

372
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,570
before chaos arises.

373
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,630
What is this?

374
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,170
It's woven using the fur on my tail.

375
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,740
Softest when each strand is freshly plucked.

376
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,940
Keep it as a souvenir.

377
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,240
What do you mean?

378
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,830
You're not leaving anymore?

379
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,460
Why?

380
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,440
There are too many things happening in the Fox Clan.

381
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,900
Auntie is getting old now.

382
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,110
Huo.

383
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,180
I think I should take up responsibility.

384
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,980
Excuses.

385
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,230
Responsibility again?

386
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,890
The Outlanders' City is the responsibility of Hua Lin.

387
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,440
The Fox Clan is your responsibility.

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Now, it's your responsibility.

389
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,160
What were you doing earlier?

390
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,420
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

391
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,950
There's no need.

393
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,810
♫The last moonlight♫

394

Wait.

395
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,740
I have something to tell you.

396
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,460
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

397
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,300
Before I met you,

398
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,060
I thought my life was the worst.

399
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,710
I didn't have parents, friends,

400
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,410
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

401
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,810

402

♫In this life, at this time♫

404
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,840
You've been hurt too.

405
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,020
But you never resented nor pitied yourself.

406
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,360
You seem calm and deep like still water,

407
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,770
♫I dare not look back♫

408

but you are actually the most affectionate and loyal.

409
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,300

♫Is there the same moonlight♫

411
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,480
I feel happy just being with you.

412
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,130
It's meaningless to say these now.

413
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,000
♫On your path?♫

414
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,190
It's not!

You are the meaning.

416

♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

417

After liking you, I realized

418
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,890
I shouldn't try to escape all the time.

419
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,340

♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

you two will waste time again.

508
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,940
Although demons live a long life,

509
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,400
you don't live eternally.

510
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,760
Since you like each other,

511
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,330
don't think about the future,

512
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,590
live the present well.

513
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,290
Thank you.

514
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
Fan Yue went to the Emotion Tree.

515
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,800
Tian Huo and Cang Shan are in the cave.

516
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,080
The forest is deep,

517
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,060
no one will come by,

518
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,720
perfect for me to take action.

519
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,470
Are you going to capture me?

520
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,740
Wrong.

521
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm going to kill you.

522
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,700
Why?

523
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,180
Do you find it strange?

524
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,360
Chong Zhao said to capture you,

525
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,540
but with me,

526
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,720
it became murder.

527
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,400
You know Chong Zhao came to me?

528
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,700
Of course.

529
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,990
Why? Are you afraid that I'll betray him?

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
So do you love him deeply

531
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,490
or are you heartless?

532
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,770
Or,

533
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,840
are you being greedy?

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,190
Cut the crap.

535
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Kill me?

536
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,350
Aren't you afraid of the backlash of the Contemplation Stone?

537
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Afraid?

538
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,280
I've long forgotten what it's like to be afraid.

539
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,380
Some things have to be done,

540
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,440
even if you're scared,

541
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
even if you'll get hurt,

542
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,410
even if you'll bleed and cry.

543
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,160
Those who are not cruel enough to themselves

544
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,180
cannot survive.

545
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,440
This thing.

546
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,860
Where did you get it from?

547
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,330
♫Across thousands of miles♫

548
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,020
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

549
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:05,790
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

550
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,950
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

551
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,330
In the realm of resentment,

552
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,480
I gave you the first spiritual energy.

553
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,930
So I can lend you some more spiritual power now.

554
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,400
The Weak Water Stone has left your body.

555
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
You don't have much time now.

556
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,570
If you have anything unfinished,

557
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,610
do it now.

558
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,880
Thank you.

559
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,750
I should be thanking you.

560
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,360
Tell me.

561
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,340
Who gave you this knife?

562
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,890
Why do I have memories of it?

563
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,520
Nonsense.

564
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,840
Aren't you going to kill me?

565
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,600
Why don't you do it?

566
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,840
Relying on Contemplation Stone,

567
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,000
do you really think I can't do anything to you?

568
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,220
Bai Shuo.

569
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,880
There are many ways to kill a person.

570
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,920
This arrow

571
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,690
may not need to be shot in your heart.

572
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,320
As long as it's not fatal,

573
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,970
the owner protection mechanism of the Contemplation Stone won't be activated.

574
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,640
From then till now,

575
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,430
you've shed quite a bit of blood, right?

576
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,550
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

577
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,420
You're merely a human,

578
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,140
do you really think you can live forever?

579

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,760
I often think of

676
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,470
the first time we met,

677
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,680
when you stood in front of me and saved me,

678
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,210
and when you were in a wedding dress.

679
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,220
I want you to be safe.

680
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,530
I'm scared that you'll be lonely.

681
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,190
♫Across thousands of miles♫

682
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,430
I want someone to take care of you.

683
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,390
I thought a lot.

684
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,230
A lot.

685
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,450
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

686
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,110
Unfortunately,

687
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
I can't be by your side forever.

688
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,730
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

689
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,470
Are you done?

690
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,290
Leave when you're done.

691
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,240
I'm leaving.

692
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,890
Goodbye.

693
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,980
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

694
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,170
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

695
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:03,330
♫To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart♫

710

717
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Fan Yue!

718
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,590
This is...

719
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,490
This is Mu Jiu's love.

720
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,690
What about Mu Jiu?

721
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,070
He's dead.

722
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,370
We still can't save him, can we?

723
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,550
This is his choice, Bai Shuo.

724
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,620
My father's death

725
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,420
was his own choice.

726
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,630
Qi's death

727
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,970
was his own choice.

728
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,070
Why are there always

729
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,970
so many cruel choices in this world?

730
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,110
Why is there no perfect solution?

731
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,470
Why can't we live well

732
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,340
with our loved ones?

733
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,610
Deities generate all things,

734
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,220
enduring the hardship of cultivation.

735
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,970
These endless decisions

736
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,990
could be a way of cultivation.

737
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,380
If so,

738
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,870
what's the point of getting stronger?

739
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,590
There are Eternals and demons beyond humans,

740
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,650
deities beyond Eternals and demons.

741
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,520
Even if you become a deity,

742
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,230
can you escape these feelings of helplessness

743
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,640
and return to freedom?

744
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,150
I don't know.

745
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,140
But I know

746
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,380
death does not necessarily lead to an end.

747
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,310
Mu Jiu was at peace when he left.

748
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,260
He even asked me to give this to you.

749
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,540
Ms. Bai,

750
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,370
when you see this,

751
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
I probably have died.

752
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,750
So,

753
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,110
you have to take this chance

754
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,420
to remember my handsome face.

755
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,450
Recently, I've been thinking...

756
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,320
Demons

757
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,860
are actually just like humans.

758
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,160
We are foolish too.

759
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:33,750
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

760
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,840
For the past 20 years,

761
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,150
I never thought

762
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,180
I would sacrifice my life for others

763
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
like a hero.

764
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,120
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

765
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,930
The old Mu Jiu

766
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,900
was childish

767
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,860
and willful.

768
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,550
Things like

769
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,410
responsibilities

770
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,030
and morality

771
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,440
are bullshit to me.

772
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,460

you lied to me.

841
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:19,010
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

842
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,750
But considering how

843
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,420
you used to always get beaten by me,

844
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,320
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

845
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,220
I don't blame you anymore

846
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,040
♫When my star falls only for you♫

847
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,380
♫When the heavens fall♫

848
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,310
I will remember what you said.

849
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,650
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

850
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,350
Tian Huo

851
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,050
will live freely forever.

852
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,890
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

853
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,820
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

854
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:53,070
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

855
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,110
You

856
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,440
are willingly showing me your back.

857
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,830
Do you trust me now?

858
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,910
Nothing about trust.

859
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,010
We are just demons from the Cold Spring Palace.

860
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,040
That's why you saved me.

861
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,000
If anything happens to you,

862
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,730
Master won’t let me go.

863
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,540
If the Cold Spring Palace loses me,

864
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,030
you can take over the position.

865
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,440
Isn’t that better?

866
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,280
Consider it a way to repay you for saving my life in the Outlanders' City.

867
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I don't want to owe anyone anything.

868
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,260
You saved me from Bai Shuo's sword.

869
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,310
Aren't you afraid that she will hate you?

870
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,200
From the day I became a demon,

871
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,680
I knew this day would come.

872
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,060
Since we can't go back,

873
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,300
there's nothing to worry about.

874
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,220
You shouldn't have saved me.

875
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,070
Did you want to die?

876
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,260
Didn't you always want me to give up?

877
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
If you want to me to give up,

878
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,230
you shouldn't be kind to me

879
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,450
nor give me any hope.

880
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,920
Today,

881
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,310
when you were injured,

882
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,150
did you feel anything strange?

883
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,280
What's strange?

884
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,580
Nothing.

885
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,160
We're going back to the Cold Spring tomorrow.

886
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,500
You'd better think about

887
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,790
how to explain to Master.
