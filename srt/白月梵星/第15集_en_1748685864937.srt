1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Master,

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,460
I wish Victoria as my heart and the夕 wear Escort Queen.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,860
World is here.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,860
I've never been

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,580
What I've never seen before

6
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,380
I only want to watch every day with the one I love

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,780
I want to be with you forever

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,540
I mean you

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,500
Fairy demon Democrat

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,340
You and him are not one

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,780
A royal perfect match

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,060
Every one

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,060
is your own

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,860
It's real

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,180
See you

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,700
then

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,340
I will

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,380
see you

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,780
See you

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,520
춤�

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,700
I have been poor and nobility

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,320
It's all because of that

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,200
Since the dawn of my death, there is no end to this journey.

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
I want to be the one

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
I want to be the one

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
I want to be the one

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
I want to be the one

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I want to be the one

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
I want to be the one

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
I want to be the one

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
I want to be the one

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
I want to be the one

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I want to be the one

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I want to be the one

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
I want to be the one

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I want to be the one

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I want to be the one

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
I want to be the one

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I want to be the one

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
I want to be the one

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
I want to be the one

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I want to be the one

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I want to be the one

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I want to be the one

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I want to be the one

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
I want to be the one

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
The Great спросant was born

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
since his birth

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,400
He was the biggest

50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,180
William and Tomb

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,940
How did you find Xiaocang?

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,040
Xiaocang, you are...

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,640
A long time ago, there is nothing

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,300
Okay?

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,100
TheWind,

56
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,880
please call a higher number

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,880
I was so anxious that I had to feed the moon all the time.

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I had no life or money.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,880
But now I know that there are seven new souls in the moon.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
I was in the first phase of the second phase.

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
To protect me, he lost another star.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
He suffered from the pain of the soul.

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
He was limited to two stars.

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Did you solve the problem?

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
I've tried to cure the pain of the soul.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I'm not sure.

67
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Master said that there was a single list in the world.

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Even the immortal Thunder Festival can be blocked.

69
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,880
If I can practice, can I help the moon to suppress the seven new souls?

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Why are you bleeding again?

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
It seems that I have to drink some more cold tea.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
I'll practice again.

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
I'm so tired.

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm so tired.

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm so tired.

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm so tired.

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Come. Come.

78
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,880
My heart is so excited.

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Feiyan.

80
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,880
It's actually you, too.

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Mu.

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Mu.

83
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Mu.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Actually, I usually call you Mu.

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Because your name is Mu.

86
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
But you are the King of the Demon.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
So you can't call this name in front of outsiders.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
I really have a feeling.

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Now,

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,880
please say goodbye.

91
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
One love, another one doesn't hide.

92
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Listen to the appearance of this store.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Take the oil from this store.

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
It's a piece of cake.

95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
The medicine for today.

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Put it here.

97
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Then you remember it.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
I'm leaving now.

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
You asked me to put it here.

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
I asked you to put it here.

101
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
You don't know what to say?

102
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
What else?

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
You are more patient than now

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
when you take care of Mu.

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Mu lost his will.

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
I don't understand anything.

107
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I want to teach him a lesson.

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
You don't understand anything?

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
You don't understand anything?

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
You know your family?

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
He said goodbye.

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
You will protect him.

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Protecting me?

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Protect him?

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Protect him?

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Isn't it just to protect you?

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
See?

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Someone can hide away from you.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
What do you want to say?

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
I want to tell you.

121
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Last time, I was drunk.

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
I was drunk.

123
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Please come back to me.

124
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Please come back to me.

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Please come back to me.

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
This is the door to the store.

127
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Why?

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I just wanted to tell you.

129
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,040
I didn't think of her.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
Why do you want to prove that you're different?

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,640
No reason.

132
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
I don't like that fool.

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
She's not a fool.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,600
She's the original Fan Yuan

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
from before.

136
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
I've never treated you as two people.

137
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Master.

138
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm incompetent.

139
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
I let you risk your life to protect the dragon pond.

140
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
There are soldiers in the Cold Spring Palace.

141
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,760
If you have any trouble,

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,160
I won't stop you.

143
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
You're in danger.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
How can you stand by and watch?

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
You've suffered a lot.

146
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Take this pill.

147
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,320
It can help you protect your heart.

148
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
It's from Folin.

149
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Are you saving her?

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,120
Yes.

151
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,200
Folin is using her轭 flower dolazz…

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
toч dude everything I did.

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,680
But, Master, don't worry.

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
I already have Mass Glacie...

155
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
andagu's Eulogy.

156
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,720
It's not worth limiting.

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Old lady.

158
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,160
Six million years ago,

159
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,360
Girls from off-road inuchen families are clueless.

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,480
There were no gods in the world.

161
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
But the palace court decided to...

162
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,240
take a punch at her grandfinals.

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,760
And begun to implore the Light God Formation.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,840
The Formation

165
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
but hidden in the form of a ghost.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
If it wasn't for the fact that there was a chance,

167
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
the King of One-Eyes wouldn't have been awake.

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
In addition, I have to use the Divine Sword to find out

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
if the purpose of the Divine Stone is related to the Immortal.

170
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
One of them is not to be known.

171
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
If the Immortal succeeds,

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
the Immortal will be in danger.

173
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Then why don't I take all the Immortals to the Cold Spring now?

174
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
You can't.

175
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,400
The actual soldiers of the Cold Spring are unknown to the

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Immortals.

177
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,200
I have a demon lord named Chenye

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,840
who is good at poison and military skills.

179
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
He is very poisonous.

180
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,840
But he has the Immortals to build the Immortals.

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,840
The Cold Spring is really very powerful.

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Since the Immortals will save you,

183
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,840
you can take the warning to the Cold Spring

184
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,840
in order to directly kill the Demon Lord.

185
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Master, you...

186
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,840
I know that it's too hard for you.

187
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
But the whole Immortals are the only Immortals

188
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,840
who can take the Immortals.

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Since they have a plan for you,

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
they won't easily hurt you.

191
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Chongzhao, I have always been your son.

192
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't want you to be in danger from the bottom of my heart.

193
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
But now, not only does Lanling need you,

194
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
but the whole Immortals need you.

195
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,840
So I can only let you live for your own good.

196
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
You are so kind.

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I believe that even if you are in danger,

198
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
you won't be disobeyed by the Immortals.

199
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I understand.

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I will do everything I can to prevent the Immortals from losing their lives.

201
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Take care.

202
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,840
The whole Immortals will be on your side.

203
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Master, if Uncle asks...

204
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
If you and Bai Shuo are on the same side,

205
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
you will definitely come back home.

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I will definitely come back.

207
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
I will definitely come back.

208
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I will definitely come back.

209
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Okay.

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Okay.

211
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Master, I think we should sell the five of us.

212
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Why? You are happy to be with me?

213
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Are you happy to see me?

214
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I think you are happy.

215
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Everyone, taste it.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
These dishes are all learned by the young master.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Even my aunt hasn't tried the dishes I made.

218
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Come, try it.

219
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Bai Shuo.

220
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
The taste is good.

221
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Right?

222
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Bai Shuo, why are you so good at it again?

223
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
What's going on?

224
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
I have been left a few times.

225
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Maybe I have been on fire recently.

226
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
How many times?

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Two or three times.

228
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Three or four times?

229
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Don't be so serious.

230
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
You can't keep your body from being in this state.

231
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
When did it start?

232
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
After Yicheng came back.

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Will it be the same after the King of the Art of the World wears the King of the Yi?

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
I never heard of it.

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Is it related to the King of the Yi?

236
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
But...

237
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
But what?

238
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
When I was in Yicheng's palace and took back the King of the Yi,

239
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I really felt that there was a new power in my body.

240
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Could it be that the God Sword and the Five-Demon Sword had a strong impact?

241
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Is there still that power left?

242
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I can't say it.

243
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I never felt that power again.

244
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
You can try it.

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,280
When you think of the King of the Yi,

246
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,840
you think of the Leader and responsibility ahead.

247
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,920
Look.

248
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,840
In the world, we are not mistaken.

249
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I surrender to the King of the Yi with no intention.

250
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Please lend me your bill according to the rules.

251
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,320
And you didn't become the King of the Yi because Lanlin found out it would be punished.

252
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I would of course be careful of it.

253
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,560
There.

254
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll wait for you.

255
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Come on.

256
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,920
Hello?

257
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,120
What is wrong?

258
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,920
You got ag autonomy?

259
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,600
What?

260
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Don't laugh.

261
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,160
I...

262
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
My disciple is writing a letter!

263
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,520
Why didn't he say anything about it?

264
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,720
He said he was thinking about it in the process.

265
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
That's right.

266
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
It's related to the Five-Thousand Poison Master.

267
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
My disciple is a physical mortal.

268
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,320
The Five-Thousand Poison Master is a god of ancient ancient.

269
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
Before the Five-Thousand Poison Master,

270
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,320
the Five-Thousand Poison Master is just a stone.

271
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
The more you think about it, the more powerful it is.

272
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,320
How can he absorb the power of the power of the mortal world?

273
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,720
Now, the writing of the letter is just beginning.

274
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
If we wait for the Five-Thousand Poison Master,

275
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
the Five-Thousand Poison Master will be opened.

276
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
How will it be?

277
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm sorry, King of the Bouties.

278
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,920
Why didn't you say it earlier?

279
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Although my old master will be in the war,

280
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,720
I will have to know it after I've been captured.

281
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,120
You said I was suddenly healthy.

282
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,520
That's why I got the Five-Thousand Poison Master's image.

283
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
You can't be wrong.

284
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
There is a way.

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
The Fox Clan has a treasure of life.

286
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,520
It's called the Water of the Ruo.

287
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,320
This is the treasure of the Fox Clan's first love.

288
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
If the water is water-eating,

289
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,120
it can be suppressed by the spirit power.

290
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,520
The Five-Thousand Poison Master will be the one to tell the truth.

291
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,920
I heard you lost a star in the first round.

292
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Let me show you.

293
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
No need. I have something else to do.

294
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,520
You are so hardworking every day and night.

295
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,120
Just say whatever you want to say.

296
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,320
It's the first time I've brought you back to the Hall of Fame.

297
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I knew that it had a soft spot.

298
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,120
I knew it had a soft spot.

299
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
This soft spot is you.

300
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
The Seven Star Flame on it can only be extinguished with five-thousand Poison Poison.

301
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
I know it will never hurt you.

302
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,720
If...

303
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,320
I mean, if that day really comes,

304
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,520
when the Hall Master needs you,

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,120
I hope you won't abandon him.

306
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,120
I will tie my own life with Fan Yuan's life.

307
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,720
Who wants your life tied to my life?

308
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
What do you mean?

309
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
What did you just say?

310
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Your life is your life.

311
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
The life of my life is the life of my life.

312
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,320
Why should I tie it together?

313
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
Did the Master tell you anything?

314
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,720
He didn't say anything.

315
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I'll go ask him myself.

316
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,920
You didn't look like this before you went to see the Master.

317
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,320
What do you mean?

318
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,520
I've always been like this.

319
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm a little tired.

320
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm afraid I'm going to get oily

321
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:03,620
from this enem

322
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm not worried about you.

323
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,740
You're not eating or drinking,

324
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,460
you're not fighting or making troubles.

325
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,940
You're just asking.

326
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,620
But I'm not patient anymore.

327
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,540
How about we play a game today?

328
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,300
It's not only us who are interested.

329
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,740
We need to have more people.

330
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,540
For example,

331
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,380
you and your friends.

332
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't understand what you mean.

333
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,220
You don't remember to kill me,

334
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,940
and you don't let me go.

335
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,820
What do you want?

336
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,500
When did I stop you?

337
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,980
But with your current injury,

338
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,220
can you walk out of the cold spring?

339
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,660
The other monsters in the Cold Spring Palace are different from me.

340
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,260
If they catch the fresh army that's in the cold,

341
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
they'll eat you up.

342
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,260
Fresh army,

343
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,460
the game I prepared for you,

344
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,180
is about to begin.

345
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,380
Come on.

346
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,500
What do you want?

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,780
I told you

348
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,500
I want to play a game with the fresh army.

349
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,700
As long as you kill one of them,

350
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,740
the rest four of you,

351
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,100
I'll let them go.

352
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,460
Fresh army,

353
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,900
you wasted this chance.

354
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,340
If you listen to me,

355
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,260
they can all live.

356
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,500
You didn't give them a chance to live.

357
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Now I want you to choose again,

358
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,900
and kill the rest four of them.

359
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,540
I can let them go.

360
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,980
Why did you kill me?

361
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,380
It's boring to kill you.

362
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,660
It's more interesting than killing the fresh army.

363
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,380
Why?

364
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,100
You can't do it.

365
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,820
Xia Ying.

366
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,140
Xia Ying.

367
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,380
Xia Ying.

368
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,780
Fresh army,

369
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,620
you lost another chance to save you.

370
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,260
Now there are three people left.

371
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,660
The rules are the same.

372
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,060
Let's start.

373
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,780
Sorry.

374
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,260
Sorry.

375
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,700
I don't want to

376
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:34,180
I don't want to

377
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,700
I want to wait for this year

378
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't want to

379
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,860
Go

380
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Go

381
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Didn't you say to let them go

382
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,860
This is the second thing I want to do with you

383
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,860
The demon is not to be trusted

384
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,620
Chen Ye is really good at making the bed

385
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,220
I really look forward to

386
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,180
He experience many yang andAbs quick

387
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,860
Push out theれる

388
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,320
Why drink beer

389
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:40,620
Cheating jackt

390
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,180
What should we do

391
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,860
Qian point

392
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,700
Go

393
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,640
No

394
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,580
Go

395
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Do you agree with what you said?

396
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,580
Welcome back to the palace, Your Majesty.

397
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,900
Your Highness.

398
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
Did something happen?

399
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,740
Your Highness...

400
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,980
I can't remember it for a few more years.

401
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,300
Why?

402
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
She is just a group of people.

403
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,700
She can't bear the power of the Immortal Immortal.

404
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,620
Liu Bi Xie just started.

405
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,900
If she keeps on remembering it,

406
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,100
the result will be a disaster.

407
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,500
What about the owner?

408
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,500
Is the owner going to give up her memory?

409
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,460
I thought you and she have established some friendship.

410
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,460
Bai Shuo saved Yi Cheng and Huayou.

411
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,020
I can guarantee it with my life.

412
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,220
But now it's the owner's life.

413
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,340
I can't lose the owner.

414
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,700
Anyone in this world can make a fortune.

415
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,420
I have my own destiny.

416
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,300
I want to protect the people.

417
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
I can't do it.

418
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,180
Where is Mu Jiu?

419
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,820
He is still in the Buji House.

420
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,020
Mu Jiu?

421
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Hu Zu has a nickname called Ruo Shui Shi.

422
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,140
If Bai Shuo has Ruo Shui Shi,

423
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,420
he can suppress the rebellion of the Immortal Immortal.

424
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,900
I'll go to see Mu Jiu now.

425
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,340
Mu Jiu

426
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,420
Ah Hu.

427
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,020
It's okay. You're a fool.

428
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,500
You can give me all the treasures you want.

429
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
But...

430
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,900
What do you mean?

431
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,740
I've been tired all day.

432
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,700
My head hurts.

433
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,860
I feel so uncomfortable.

434
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,460
If I can help you,

435
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,020
maybe...

436
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm kidding.

437
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I'm kidding.

438
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,140
Actually, it's useless.

439
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,100
Where?

440
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,260
What?

441
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,620
I'll just put it here.

442
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,740
Alright.

443
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,220
Put it here.

444
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,700
It hurts.

445
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,100
I'm good.

446
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,460
Really good.

447
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
You're back.

448
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,980
Where does the Nenai disgustingñas about?

449
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,620
You must be joking.

450
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,740
Why don't you come back to Mount Jin and be my Young Master's wife?

451
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,460
What protection do you want?

452
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,700
Just dance.

453
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,100
Young Master.

454
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,420
Young Master, you're really here.

455
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,060
Changsheng.

456
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,020
Master Zhang, why are you here?

457
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,300
The Chief of the Mountain has ordered you to bring you back to Mount Jin.

458
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,460
I won't.

459
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
The Chief of the Mountain also said that

460
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,500
if you don't agree with me, don't blame me for being hard on you.

461
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,820
Why did you...

462
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,260
Since the Chief of the Mountain has ordered me to come back,

463
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,340
I wouldn't be able to see my father-in-law if I didn't stop him.

464
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,940
But our Chief of the Mountain has asked me to protect you, Young Master.

465
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,940
If I lose him, I can't tell you.

466
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,580
What do you want?

467
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,900
You want me to go to Hu Clan.

468
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,540
I'll go back to my class.

469
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,460
But the Chief of the Mountain doesn't mean that.

470
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,060
I mean that.

471
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,940
Uncle.

472
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,820
Are you okay?

473
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,900
The human clan can't stand the power of the Five-Nin-Ten.

474
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,620
If we continue,

475
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,140
Bai Shuo will be dead.

476
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,500
Fan Yuan, if you really do well for him,

477
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,540
you can't let him have the Five-Nin-Ten again.

478
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,340
Go back and rest.

479
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,980
I don't need you to talk anymore.

480
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,180
You said it yesterday.

481
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,660
Your life is your life.

482
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,260
My life is mine.

483
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,060
Then please don't mind what I want to do.

484
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,060
Uncle, bad news.

485
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Tian Hu and Mu Jiu are in trouble.

486
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,780
I've found a place to stay.

487
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,420
Other places are all cold and humid.

488
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,180
There's a fight between Mu Jiu and Tian Hu.

489
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,900
Tian Hu and Mu Jiu should be missing here.

490
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,060
It's Hu Clan.

491
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,620
Did Tian Hu go to Hu Clan to find the water?

492
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,780
This is the sign left by the Hu Clan.

493
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,980
Hu Clan's sign?

494
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,860
Master, the Hu Clan and the Hu Clan

495
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,340
are always in a bad mood.

496
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,500
It must be Mu Jiu's trouble.

497
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,740
He's been taken away by the Tian Hu.

498
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,900
Master, let's go to Hu Clan to save him.

499
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,500
Master, why are you so anxious?

500
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,540
Tian Hu is very clever and has a strong personality.

501
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,460
Even if he's the cousin of the Hu Clan,

502
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,100
he can't take the two big people

503
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,420
to the Buji House without any worries.

504
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,700
What do you mean?

505
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,620
If Tian Hu really wants to do something,

506
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,500
it's a matter of his own children.

507
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,060
It's obvious that he doesn't want to attack us.

508
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,260
Why?

509
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,580
If he attacks the shop,

510
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,260
they won't be able to leave.

511
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,140
Then Tian Hu won't be able to go to Hu Clan.

512
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,300
He's the only one who can't go to Hu Clan.

513
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,700
Tian Hu can't go to Hu Clan.

514
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,900
You mean that

515
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,340
Tian Hu wasn't taken away by Lu?

516
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,420
He's the one who's going to Hu Clan.

517
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,040
LAYER

518
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,260
However,

519
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,300
if I were to send Chang Sheng to find you,

520
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
You still remember my aunt?

521
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I've seen the Golden Thread Embroidery.

522
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Heavenly Fire Demon Lord, you don't need to be so polite.

523
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I can't be the one who can take the legal position of the House of Hao Yue.

524
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,300
The Mountain Lord is one of the three demons in the Demon Tribe.

525
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
How can Heavenly Fire's position be so unethical?

526
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
Is that so?

527
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Then what's the reason why the Demon Lord doesn't ask for permission?

528
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Auntie, it's not about Heavenly Fire.

529
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I know.

530
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
You asked me to go back to Mount Jinyou

531
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
and you still want to take over the Mountain Lord's position and manage it.

532
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Auntie, how many gold coins do I have?

533
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
You still don't know?

534
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Just me?

535
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
The House of Huzuo?

536
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
I'm not worthy of it.

537
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
You don't want to take over the Mountain Lord's position.

538
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Then what do you want?

539
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Join the House of Hao Yue?

540
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
After three days, it's your Mountain Lord's reception point.

541
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
It's already done as a long-term task.

542
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
You don't need to go anywhere these days.

543
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Otherwise, I'll really hit your leg.

544
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Why do you want me to take over the Mountain Lord's position again?

545
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
I already said that I don't want to.

546
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
You don't want to?

547
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Fine.

548
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Then I'll take away the Demon Lord's life.

549
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Cang Shan, prepare yourself.

550
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Go to Mount Jinyou immediately.

551
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
You stay.

552
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Why?

553
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
This is the family business of the House of Hao Yue.

554
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
It has nothing to do with you.

555
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm with Tian Huo in Yicheng.

556
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
He's a friend of the King of Jinli.

557
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
He's the reason why he went to the Huzuo.

558
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
As a friend, I'm a person...

559
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
It has nothing to do with you.

560
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Mount Jinyou is a Demon Lord's territory.

561
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
You're a human being.

562
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
You have all the powers.

563
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
According to your wisdom, you'll be fine.

564
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
Why did you threaten me with Tian Huo?

565
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,300
It has nothing to do with him.

566
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Then you should leave the House of Hao Yue and stay in Yicheng.

567
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
You then came to the Human Clan.

568
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
How long has it been?

569
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
You don't even have a clue.

570
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Do you have any nonsense in your heart?

571
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Do you have any auntie like me?

572
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
These...

573
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
I did these things wrong.

574
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
But Tian Huo really has something to do with this.

575
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm not sure.

576
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
I'm not sure.

577
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
I'm not sure.

578
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
I'm not sure.

579
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
I'm not sure.

580
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm not sure.

581
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm not sure.

582
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm not sure.

583
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
But Tian Huo really has nothing to do with this.

584
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
I have to stay with him.

585
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Shut up.

586
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
He's Fan Yue's man.

587
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
What does it have to do with the relationship between Jin You Shan and Hao Yue?

588
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Do you have any idea?

589
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Who is he close to?

590
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Who is he close to?

591
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,300
He's close to you.

592
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
What's the purpose of his pregnancy?

593
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Have you ever thought about it?

594
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
You're wrong.

595
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Hao Yue is close to Jin You Shan.

596
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
He's not good at all.

597
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
You're the head of the Yicheng Clan.

598
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,300
You should think before you speak.

599
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
How dare you?

600
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
How dare you fool me?

601
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
I dare not.

602
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,300
But you have to explain to me.

603
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Master.

604
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Why are you here?

605
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Did the shell I gave you broken?

606
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
I feel that the shell broke.

607
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
I came to see it.

608
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Where's Fan Yue?

609
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Did you quarrel?

610
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Master.

611
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
What did Fan Yue talk to you about?

612
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
He changed his mind after he came back.

613
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
You two.

614
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
One is a ghost killer.

615
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
One is a living dead.

616
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
You two are officials.

617
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,300
You two are officials.

618
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,300
You two are officials.

619
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
You two are officials.

620
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,300
You two are officials.

621
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
You two are officials.

622
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Why are you torturing me?

623
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Master.

624
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Who is the master?

625
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
How old are you?

626
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
You're all in the palace.

627
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Let me ask you.

628
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Did Fan Yue go out?

629
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
How do you know?

630
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I know that he went to Hu tribe.

631
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
You know that?

632
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Why didn't he take you there?

633
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
He said I'm an outsider.

634
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I don't have the spiritual power to guide me.

635
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
He didn't let me follow.

636
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,300
You don't know what kind of ghost you are.

637
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
What did he say?

638
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Why are you laughing?

639
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Of course I don't believe it.

640
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I just don't want to have any conflicts with him.

641
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
If you don't come,

642
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I'll go to Hu tribe and ask him.

643
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Master.

644
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Just tell me.

645
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't hide it from me.

646
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
And don't lie to me.

647
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
It's okay to tell you.

648
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
But you have to answer me a question.

649
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
What question?

650
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Did you have feelings for Fan Yue?

651
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:51,300
It must be me.

652
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
How's that possible?

653
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
I'm a bit superior to him.

654
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,300
What do I have to compare me with?

655
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
See?

656
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
So heavy.

657
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
But in my heart,

658
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,020
Fan Yue changed his face, you also changed your face.

659
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,860
Your heart is beating fast.

660
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,940
You followed him and said you didn't have anything.

661
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,420
I...

662
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,380
This man is a kind man.

663
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,100
It's obvious that you are for me,

664
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,300
but I always misunderstand each other.

665
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,020
I even miss each other.

666
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,420
Tong Er,

667
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,780
there are only two stars on Fan Yue's body.

668
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,860
But he is now going to the Fox Clan to hide.

669
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,820
Dangerous.

670
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,700
Hiding?

671
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,380
Fan Yue went there to find a treasure for the Fox Clan.

672
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,540
It's called Ruo Shui Shi.

673
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,460
But the Fox Clan's master Chang Mei

674
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,740
is so violent that she can't even

675
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,340
let the treasure be found.

676
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,340
Fan Yue, what's the harm she's caused?

677
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
You know it best.

678
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,580
This is a terrible battle.

679
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,100
Why did she go to the Fox Clan?

680
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,500
Is there a reason for her to go to the Fox Clan?

681
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,060
Of course, that treasure is...

682
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
That treasure is so good.

683
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,580
If Fan Yue is now in a state of shock,

684
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,620
if the whole Fox Clan is fighting,

685
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,220
maybe she'll lose another star.

686
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,020
Monster, don't tell her that I told you about Fan Yue!

687
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,420
Aunt, I've lost my parents since I was a kid.

688
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,380
You raised me.

689
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,260
In my heart,

690
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,060
I've always treated you as my own mother.

691
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,500
Even if I marry a god,

692
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,980
I won't forget you.

693
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,420
I'm weak in nature.

694
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,860
I didn't have a few of them in my family.

695
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,340
I've been bullied a lot.

696
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,180
I've grown up now.

697
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm afraid of their faces.

698
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,820
They're all on your side.

699
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,820
If I had known,

700
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,060
I wouldn't have been afraid of them.

701
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,460
But this time,

702
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,500
I knew it was a lie.

703
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,340
It's so big in the sky.

704
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,100
I should have counted them first.

705
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,420
Aunt, if you really taught the Fox Clan

706
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,660
to me,

707
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,100
I wouldn't be afraid of your past.

708
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
I'll give it back.

709
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,460
Since you know these things,

710
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,300
you should practice more.

711
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,940
You should protect yourself and the Fox Clan.

712
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,540
Instead, you should follow the woman.

713
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,700
You should be careful.

714
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,860
Aunt, I understand your feelings.

715
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,100
But I don't want to

716
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
make my own feelings come true.

717
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,580
I like the fire.

718
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,660
I like the days when I'm free.

719
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,580
Mount Jinyou is too small.

720
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,700
The responsibility of the mountain master is too heavy.

721
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,380
Aunt, if you really do it for me,

722
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,700
just let me go.

723
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,220
I don't want to make you happy.

724
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,140
But...

725
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,140
You like the fire.

726
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,980
You're willing to give up everything for it.

727
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,180
What about him?

728
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,460
Does he like you?

729
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,940
He...

730
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,580
He does not like me.

731
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,060
We're not familiar with that.

732
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,380
When he knows me, he will...

733
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,340
You gave him the happy fruits in the room.

734
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,820
You're a young master.

735
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,180
Why did you do this?

736
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,620
You like his heart.

737
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,220
You can tell it.

738
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,060
Xiaojiu, you're a wife.

739
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,500
I can't persuade you about love.

740
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,500
But since you know the mountain master,

741
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,820
you must promise me.

742
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,300
But not now.

743
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,340
What do you mean?

744
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,500
Three days.

745
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,180
I'll give you three days.

746
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,540
If you can make the fire like you,

747
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,820
the one who will take you in three days

748
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,420
will be the most sacred wedding of the Hu tribe.

749
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,060
But if you can't make the fire like you,

750
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,860
you can't make the fire like you.

751
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,580
That means he doesn't deserve you to give up everything.

752
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,020
You must make the place of the mountain master.

753
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,220
What do you think?

754
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,540
Do you dare?

755
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,660
Master, you've been wearing white tree all the way.

756
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,940
Why didn't you wear it?

757
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,420
And these days,

758
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,140
do you feel too fierce about white tree?

759
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Master, how do you get in?

760
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,820
It's a kiss.

761
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,940
It's a kiss.

762
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,020
Cut the head.

763
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,180
I need you to go to the other room.

764
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,580
I'll go to the other room.

765
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,900
I need you to go to the other room.

766
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,140
Master,

767
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,940
the ceremony is important to the Hu tribe.

768
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,540
Mujiu is young and young.

769
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,940
There are not many palace guards in the tribe.

770
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,340
It's so dangerous to spread the word.

771
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,460
Wei Min.

772
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,820
This position is my generation's heritage.

773
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,940
I can tell you who it is.

774
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,700
If you want to be a member,

775
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,540
you can solve the situation.

776
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,740
I didn't mean that.

777
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,540
But...

778
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,740
You don't have to care about that.

779
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,380
But Xiaojiu is

780
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,540
so famous that he doesn't have it.

781
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,820
As long as he can stay in the Hu tribe for three days,

782
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,100
the position will be in order.

783
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,820
Changwu, go and watch.

784
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,060
He has any movements.

785
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,420
Report to me at any time.

786
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,460
Yes.

787
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,260
But, Master.

788
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,780
The one behind the fire is not a good one.

789
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,700
We broke into Buji House.

790
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,420
Now, we're holding on to him.

791
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,660
I'm afraid...

792
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,420
Afraid of what?

793
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,740
If you fall down,

794
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,700
you'll be the one who will be the leader of this tribe.

795
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,180
You've been in the Hu tribe for so many years.

796
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,540
You're finally here today.

797
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
Master.

798
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,540
The owner of the backyard is here.

799
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Master.

800
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Master.

801
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Master.

802
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
The owner of the backyard is here.

803
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Master.

804
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
Could it be that we're going to be killed?

805
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Yes.

806
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Their master is not a vegetarian.

807
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Let's go and see.

808
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Yes.

809
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Let's go.

810
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Let's go.

811
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Let's go.

812
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Let's go.

813
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Let's go.

814
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,420
Let's go.

815
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Let's go.

816
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Let's go.

817
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Let's go.

818
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
Let's go.

819
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Let's go.

820
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Let's go.

821
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
The people who are not related should all leave.

822
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I have something to tell you.

823
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
Let's go.

824
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You came to Mount Jingyou for the sake of the Fire?

825
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
It's obvious that you're not talking about the dark side.

826
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
The Fire Demon Army is indeed in my mountain.

827
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,420
But I can't give you back the person today.

828
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Why?

829
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,420
The matter that Mujiu and the Fire Demon came to me,

830
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
you must know it.

831
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
My nephew is a kind of love.

832
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,420
I promised him to give him three days to win the Fire Demon.

833
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,420
If possible, I will hold a wedding for him.

834
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Wedding?

835
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
You're so stupid.

836
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,420
Do you like to do some romantic things?

837
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
The matter is a mess.

838
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I guess you should know that

839
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,420
the old man in the Cold Palace is holding a belly of bad water.

840
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,420
Even though you're so strong,

841
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,420
I'm a good friend of Mount Jingyou.

842
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
You're better than a strong enemy now.

843
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,420
You should be a good enemy.

844
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Is it dangerous for you to be the master of the mountain?

845
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
No.

846
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm asking for your help.

847
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
My nephew is born with a weak waist.

848
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,420
And the demon clan is always strong.

849
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm afraid that he won't have a single one if I'm not here.

850
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,420
Since Mujiu likes the Fire Demon,

851
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
if he can make them both get together,

852
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I can feel more at ease with the Mount Jingyou.

853
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,420
Just be Changmei's master and see him as a person.

854
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,420
There's no need for a person.

855
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,420
He decides the Fire Demon by himself.

856
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,420
The mountain master wants me to protect Mujiu from now on.

857
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,420
It's not impossible.

858
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I just want something.

859
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
What is it?

860
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,420
A weak water.

861
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Negotiator

862
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,420
My heart will always guide you to touch me

863
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:03,420
Come, come

864
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,420
My heart is so excited

865
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,420
Wait for me

866
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:22,420
My heart will always guide you to touch me

867
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,420
You are the light I want to see

868
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,420
You are the only way

869
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,420
I want to be with you

870
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,420
I want to be with you

871
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,420
I want to be with you

872
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,420
You are the blue soil of my life

873
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,420
I want to be with you

874
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,420
I want to be with you

875
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,420
I want to be with you

876
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,420
I want to be with you
