1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimesâ€¦

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 24]

19
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,840
Qi Feng was hurt by the evil insect in order to save me.

20
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,950
Don't blame yourself.

21
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,500
I will find a way to save him.

22
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,170
Master.

23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
There's nothing in this box.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,460
The evil insect really has come back to life.

25
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,060
Maybe it was not dead at all.

26
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,520
It just had been pretending to be dead.

27
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,140
This is...

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,870
Qi Feng has the same blood hole

29
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,530
as that on Cang Shan's father.

30
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,180
If I find out

31
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,610
who used this evil insect to harm people,

32
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,540
I will tear him into pieces.

33
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,890
Cang Shan,

34
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,190
go see if your mother is back.

35
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,140
Invite her here.

36
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,700
I have something to ask her.

37
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,140
Why don't you just extract the evil insect?

38
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,030
I can't.

39
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,030
Then... why could the evil insect in Chief's body

40
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,380
be extracted?

41
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,170
Because Chief is dead.

42
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,110
It can't be extracted

43
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,830
unless the host is dead.

44
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,510
How should we save Qi Feng?

45
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,840
I've protected his heart and meridians with my demonic power.

46
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,940
The evil insect can't kill him for the time being.

47
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,820
Master.

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,600
Bai Shuo.

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,450
My mother hasn't come back yet.

50
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,970
Cang Shan,

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
you stay here and take care of Qi Feng.

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,340
The clansmen still have some misunderstanding of you.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,659
You shouldn't walk around.

54
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,470
Fan Yue and I are going

55
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,600
to find your mother.

56
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,920
My mother will be fine.

57
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,760
Right?

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,030
No matter what,

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,790
I will do everything I can to minimize the damage the murderer

60
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,590
has inflicted on the Stone Clan.

61
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,060
Father, what are you doing?

62
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm not leaving.

63
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,310
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up!

64
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,200
Father,

65
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,160
can you tell me

66
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,280
what on earth happened?

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,430
Why are we suddenly leaving the Stone Clan?

68
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,300
Don't ask.

69
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,870
I'm your father.

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,920
I won't harm you.

71
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,650
We must leave now.

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,580
I'm not leaving.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,950
If you don't tell me why,

74
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,970
I won't go anywhere.

75
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,410
You...

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,990
Chief is already dead.

77
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,900
You are an elder of our clan.

78
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,700
If you leave,

79
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,130
what about the clansmen?

80
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,100
We should leave as soon as possible

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,990
just because Chief is dead.

82
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,620
Didn't you say

83
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,650
Chief was killed by Cang Shan?

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,290
Are you afraid of Cang Shan?

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,440
Or...

86
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,900
Father,

87
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,450
are you afraid

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,850
of someone else?

89
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,960
I watched Cang Shan grow up.

90
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,040
How could I not know his nature?

91
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,330
He would never kill his father!

92
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,800
But you wanted to kill him in front

93
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,450
of the clansmen!

94
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,730
I did that to show the real murderer!

95
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,909
Anyway, there should be no delay.

96
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,840
Come with me now!

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,850
Young Chief, who are you waiting for?

98
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,650
Sir.

99
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,310
You're finally awake.

100
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,780
How are you feeling?

101
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,580
Do you feel uncomfortable?

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,770
No.

103
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm fine.

104
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
Master injected

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,080
demonic power into your body

106
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,210
to protect your heart and meridians.

107
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,930
You'll be fine for the time being.

108
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,200
Yue is so nice to me.

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,110
I've been lying in bed for too long.

110
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,510
My body is a little stiff.

111
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,060
Can you do me a favor?

112
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,790
Put me in the wheelchair.

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,330
It's cold at night.

114
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,430
Take care of your legs.

115
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,510
Don't catch a cold.

116
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,390
Are you so considerate to everyone?

117
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,909
You are Master's family.

118
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,930
Of course I should take good care of you.

119
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,630
You are the young master of the Stone Clan.

120
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,340
Why are you willing to join the Bright Moon Palace

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,070
and be a guardian by Yue's side?

122
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,340
I'm not the young master of the Stone Clan.

123
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,380
I left the Stone Clan long ago.

124
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,420
I had been wandering in the Demon Race at that time.

125
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,280
Later, I met Master and helped him

126
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,010
establish the Bright Moon Palace.

127
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,010
Since then, I've had a place to stay.

128
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,550
In the Demon Race, the strong prey on the weak.

129
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,280
Without Master's protection,

130
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm afraid I would have been killed

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,950
by other demons.

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,750
Yue told me

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,870
you left the Stone Clan

134
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,140
because of something that happened in the clan before.

135
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,840
You take so good care of me.

136
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,880
Is it because

137
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,880
you remember your father

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
also broke a boy's legs?

139
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,800
My father made such a mistake.

140
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,760
So when I see you,

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,909
I want to take good care of you.

142
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,520
I can't walk.

143
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,750
Please go get me

144
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,350
the medicine in the cabinet.

145
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,590
The cabinet?

146
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,580
Okay.

147
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,870
Sir, why are you laughing?

148
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,030
Thinking about the gift you're about to receive

149
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,790
fills me with excitement.

150
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,340
Mother.

151
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Mother!

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,310
She died long ago.

153
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,810
How can you wake up a dead person?

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
You

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
killed my mother?

156
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,100
Not just her.

157
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,340
Your father too.

158
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,140
And those members of the Stone Clan,

159
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,590
all of you will be killed!

160
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to kill you!

161
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,890
Why?

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,900
There was no grudge between you and my parents.

163
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,420
Why did you kill them?

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,790
No grudge?

165
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,500
Cang Shan,

166
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,280
take a good look and see who I really am.

167
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,580
You...

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,050
What?

169
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,960
My legs were broken beside the tombs.

170
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,120
Your old friend has come back,

171
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,650
but you can't recognize me?

172
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,350
Father.

173
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,420
I've thought it through.

174
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,570
I'm not leaving.

175
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,940
What... What do you want to do now?

176
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,280
Since the Stone Clan is in danger,

177
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,560
I must stay!

178
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,820
You've spent your whole life working hard for the clan.

179
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,540
Now you can live in seclusion comfortably

180
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,730
in your old age.

181
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,810
But I'm your son.

182
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,870
I can't leave!

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,990
Father,

184
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,810
after I solve the crisis of the Stone Clan,

185
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,000
I will take you home.

186
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,980
Shut up!

187
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Who wants you to be a good person now?

188
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,910
In this world,

189
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,770
it's not just about being right or wrong.

190
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,860
I said we should leave now.

191
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,920
Then we must leave!

192
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,460
Remember,

193
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,630
being alive is more important than anything else.

194
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,500
Even if you'll hate me in the future,

195
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,040
I want you to live well.

196
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,010
Father.

197
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,750
Let's go!

198
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,350
Your son is loyal and filial,

199
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,870
but you are a coward.

200
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,100
What a pity.

201
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,960
You...

202
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,680
What on earth happened in the Stone Clan

203
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,920
back then?

204
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,850
It makes you so scared.

205
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,820
Why are you here?

206
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,870
Master came all the way to the Stone Clan

207
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,530
to help you find the murderer,

208
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,360
but you want to leave without saying goodbye.

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,530
Is this the Stone Clan's hospitality?

210
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,350
I didn't invite you here.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,670
It's the Stone Clan's business.

212
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,200
We'll handle it ourselves.

213
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,960
You two, please go back.

214
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,450
I'm going to ask you one last time.

215
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,490
What on earth happened in the Stone Clan back then?

216
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,530
Father,

217
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,890
just tell them.

218
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,350
Cang Shan said

219
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,570
Master of Bright Moon is here to help us.

220
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,760
The Stone Clan

221
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,810
has always been kind to people.

222
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,280
But if people know about that,

223
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,160
no one will be willing to help the Stone Clan.

224
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,820
The Stone Clan has always been solitary.

225
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,080
We migrated, setting up camps

226
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,280
wherever we stopped.

227
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,100
That year,

228
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,660
a devastating illness suddenly struck the clan.

229
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,790
The bones of those ill

230
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,320
were as soft as mud.

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,700
They couldn't stand.

232
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,310
And their bodies ached.

233
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,270
Lei.

234
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,360
Does it hurt a lot?

235
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,570
Here. We've brought you medicine.

236
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,300
You're back.

237
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,140
Go.

238
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,790
Help the clansmen

239
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,720
take the medicine with warm water.

240
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,930
This is...

241
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,370
This is the medicine for treating the clansmen's illness.

242
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,100
Are you going to watch

243
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,530
our clansmen die?

244
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,930
But this...

245
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,570
Hurry up.

246
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,300
I remember

247
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,570
I was so sick that I couldn't walk.

248
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,430
I thought

249
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,350
I could never stand again in this life.

250
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,030
But after taking the medicine Chief and the elders

251
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,360
brought back in jars,

252
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,990
I recovered.

253
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,940
What was the medicine

254
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,770
in the jars?

255
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,210
Bones.

256
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,000
We dug up the tombs of an ancient clan

257
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,510
and ate their spiritual bones.

258
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,770
What?

259
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
The ancient clan was auspicious.

260
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,230
Although they died,

261
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,230
their bones still had spiritual energy

262
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,470
and could heal bones.

263
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,780
We had no choice at that time.

264
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,790
That was the only way.

265
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,710
Father,

266
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,870
you were so foolish!

267
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,070
That's immoral,

268
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,980
and we'll die a horrible death.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
I don't care!

270
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,530
I just wanted you to survive!

271
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,220
The Stone Clan

272
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,940
has never killed anyone these years.

273
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,630
Why should we be struck by such a deadly disease?

274
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,000
We just unearthed the bones of the dead.

275
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,220
They already died,

276
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,420
but their spiritual bones

277
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,660
could save every one of the Stone Clan.

278
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,830
Why couldn't we eat them?

279
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,230
Why couldn't we eat them?

280
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,750
That's why the murderer

281
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,930
broke the bones of those elders.

282
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,410
It was a punishment,

283
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,150
a ritual of revenge!

284
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
He came to take revenge.

285
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
He came for the whole Stone Clan.

286
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,540
He came for Cang Shan.

287
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,160
What does it have to do with Cang Shan?

288
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,560
Back then, there was a boy of the ancient clan

289
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,230
guarding the tombs.

290
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,710
No outsiders were allowed to go near them.

291
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,420
At that time, Cang Shan was in the maniac condition.

292
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,080
He was delirious and couldn't control himself.

293
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,070
So he...

294
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,610
broke the boy's legs.

295
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,730
What's the ancient clan

296
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,150
that you just mentioned?

297
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,930
The Bai Ze Clan.

298
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,060
What did you say?

299
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,980
What did you say?

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,010
Father!

301
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,070
Master.

302
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,900
Fan Yue,

303
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,710
let go!

304
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,650
Let go!

305
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,340
Father.

306
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,730
Father,

307
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,030
are you alright?

308
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,310
They went to the Bai Ze Clan's ruins back then.

309
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,670
The boy guarding the tombs was Qi Feng.

310
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,870
If so...

311
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,970
Oh no!

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,790
Cang Shan!

313
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,080
You're the boy of the ancient clan?

314
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,610
Impossible.

315
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,610
You already died.

316
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,670
Of course you want me dead.

317
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
If I die,

318
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,520
no one will know the dirty thing the Stone Clan did.

319
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,280
Did your parents ever tell you

320
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,060
that the owner of that land,

321
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,030
the ancient clan you spoke of,

322
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,610
is the Bai Ze Clan?

323
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Don't forget

324
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,300
your master is also from the Bai Ze Clan.

325
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,920
If he knows what you did,

326
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,740
do you think

327
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,220
he'll destroy the Stone Clan himself or not?

328
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,440
No.

329
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
He won't.

330
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,620
The Stone Clan did do something wrong,

331
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,290
but not every one of the clan is guilty.

332
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,560
In my eyes,

333
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,060
no one from the Stone Clan is innocent!

334
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,430
Right,

335
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,660
I forgot to tell you something.

336
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,470
I could control your father

337
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,940
because back then,

338
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,430
to suppress the monstrous power within you,

339
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,270
he carved out his own demon core and gave it to you.

340
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,020
To spare you from guilt,

341
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,810
he altered your memories

342
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,090
and took the blame

343
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,870
for everything you did.

344
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,300
What did you say?

345
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,060
Such a moving father-son bond.

346
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,320
It's so enviable.

347
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,920
What demon core?

348
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,530
What memory alteration?

349
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,130
Since you don't remember anything,

350
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,660
let me help you remember.

351
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,050
You're not Yue.

352
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,980
Who are you?

353
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,310
What are you doing?

354
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
-Cang Shan!
-This way!

355
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,130
-Cang Shan!
-Cang Shan!

356
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,280
-Cang Shan!
-Cang Shan!

357
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,070
-Cang Shan! Calm down!
-Cang Shan!

358
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,770
Cang Shan, what are you doing?

359
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,280
What are you doing?

360
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,180
Calm down!

361
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,310
This...

362
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,280
This...

363
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,020
Your father's demon core is so bright.

364
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,090
It's just like his love for his son.

365
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,820
They're both disgusting.

366
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,100
I'll kill you.

367
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,760
I swear I'll kill you.

368
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,550
I'll kill you.

369
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,390
I'll kill you.

370
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,880
I'll kill you!

371
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,350
I'll kill you.

372
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,130
I'll kill you!

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,130
Kill.

374
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,140
Help! Cang Shan wants to kill me!

375
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,280
Help! Cang Shan wants to kill me!

376
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,200
Look! Over there!

377
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,790
Help!

378
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,310
You... You...

379
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,440
I'll kill you!

380
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,830
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

381
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,230
-Help!
-What's going on?

382
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,730
Hurry! Get up!

383
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,090
-Let go!
-Kill him. Kill him.

384
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,910
Hold him down!

385
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,460
Young Chief went crazy.

386
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,910
I saw him killing his mother.

387
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,100
He wants to silence me.

388
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,530
Kill him! Kill him!

389
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,940
Kill him! I'll kill you!

390
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
I'll kill you!

391
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,360
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

392
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,440
I'll kill you!

393
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,270
Yeah.

394
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,680
Burn him to death.

395
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,300
Cang Shan!

396
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,540
You killed your father and mother!

397
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,790
You're unforgivable!

398
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,970
He's a monster!

399
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,080
Burn him!

400
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,700
-Burn him! Burn him!
-Burn him! Burn him!

401
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,000
It was Qi Feng! It was Qi Feng!

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,960
He killed my parents and those clansmen!

403
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,450
He is the murderer!

404
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,470
He is!

405
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
Qi Feng is disabled in both legs.

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,020
His demonic power is weak.

407
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,660
How could he possibly kill anyone?

408
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,580
We saw you trying to silence him!

409
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,820
At this point, you're still slandering him!

410
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,540
Bastard!

411
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,200
We won't trust you anymore!

412
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,470
Burn him!

413
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,070
-Burn him! Burn him!
-Burn him! Burn him!

414
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,450
-Burn him! Burn him!
-Burn him! Burn him!

415
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,570
-Burn him!
-Burn him!

416
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,820
Stop!

417
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,050
-Burn him!
-Burn him!

418
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,550
Cang Shan is not the murderer.

419
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,750
You can't kill him.

420
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,880
Ms. Bai,

421
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,050
we respect you because you and Master of Bright Moon are friends.

422
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,960
These days,

423
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,160
we have never restricted your movements.

424
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,960
But today,

425
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,820
it's the Stone Clan's own business.

426
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,030
You'd better stay out of this!

427
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,090
-Yes!
-You'd better stay out of this!

428
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,060
Cang Shan is a member of the Bright Moon Palace.

429
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,320
His business is the Bright Moon Palace's business.

430
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,350
The clans in the demon realm don't interfere with each other.

431
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,980
The Bright Moon Palace

432
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,660
has gone too far by doing this!

433
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,160
If you call this going too far,

434
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,880
what should we call everything the Stone Clan did

435
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
to the Baize Clan back then?

436
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,110
Occupying the land, digging up the tombs,

437
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,440
eating their bones, and suppressing their souls.

438
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,240
Which of those isn't overboard?

439
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,850
Which of those isn't a crime?

440
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,730
I knew you would come to me.

441
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,410
Is this the unspoken bond

442
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,720
between brothers?

443
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,310
Right,

444
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,460
it's time to tell you my real identity.

445
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,780
Greetings, Master of Bright Moon. I'm Chen Ye from the Cold Spring Palace.

446
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,940
You did everything

447
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
to the Stone Clan?

448
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,790
You already have the answer in your heart.

449
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,720
Do you have to ask me?

450
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,900
Yes.

451
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,780
Cang Shan's father, Mrs. Cang,

452
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,510
and those elders

453
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,960
were killed by me.

454
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,090
Not just them.

455
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,610
Everyone of the Stone Clan

456
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,580
will be killed by me.

457
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,870
The Stone Clan did do something wrong,

458
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,940
but you shouldn't exterminate the whole clan.

459
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,960
I shouldn't exterminate the whole clan?

460
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,990
Master,

461
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,530
you are so generous.

462
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,930
For themselves, the Stone Clan

463
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,430
took the Baize Clan's land and unearthed

464
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,500
the bones of the Baize Clan's members as medicine.

465
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,810
In order to conceal their crimes,

466
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,830
they set up a stone formation

467
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,120
to suppress the resentment aura of the Baize Clan.

468
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,880
Fan Yue,

469
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,630
what makes them less guilty?

470
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,430
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

471
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,830
If I had known earlier...

472
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,610
If you had known earlier,

473
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,470
would you destroy the Stone Clan?

474
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,830
Just moments ago, you still told me

475
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,490
the Stone Clan shouldn't be exterminated.

476
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,740
Fan Yue,

477
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,980
in this world, you're the last person qualified for avenging

478
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,140
the Baize Clan.

479
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
It was your birth

480
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,370
that led to the Baize Clan's extermination.

481
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,770
Without you, nothing would have happened.

482
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,410
And I wouldn't have suffered so much.

483
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,590
You asked me why just now.

484
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,100
I also want to know why.

485
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,130
Why was I the one who was abandoned

486
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,720
-by Grandfather and the clansmen?
-Grandfather!

487
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,310
Why was I the one whose legs were broken by Cang Shan?

488
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,240
Why was I the one who survived

489
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,430
like a stray dog?

490
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,110
During those years of my greatest suffering,

491
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,240
what were you doing?

492
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,090
You were busy with your ambition,

493
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,890
being Master of Bright Moon,

494
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,720
and ruling the Polar Region!

495
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,170
Fan Yue,

496
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,640
what gives you the right to stand on the moral high ground

497
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
to judge me?

498
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,100
Don't listen to her nonsense!

499
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,490
She's not one of us.

500
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,720
How could she possibly know so much?

501
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,250
Exactly.

502
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,630
She must have made it up

503
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,210
-to save Cang Shan!
-That's nonsense!

504
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,690
You made it up!

505
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
She didn't!

506
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,810
What she just said is true.

507
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,260
I was also involved

508
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,370
in what happened back then.

509
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,970
Chief, a few elders, and I

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,870
dug up the tombs of the ancient clan,

511
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,870
ground the bones into powder,

512
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,890
added the powder to the medicine,

513
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,020
and asked the sick clansmen to take it.

514
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,550
It really happened?

515
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,680
Is what he said true?

516
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,650
This...

517
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,820
It really happened?

518
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,250
Everyone,

519
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,670
this has nothing to do with Cang Shan.

520
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,150
The boy from the Baize Clan didn't die back then.

521
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,840
He's come to take revenge!

522
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,260
-Take revenge?
-Take revenge?

523
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,810
Cang Shan.

524
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,040
Are you okay?

525
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,680
He has killed so many people.

526
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,990
He will kill me

527
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,880
and all of us!

528
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,570
I believe you don't truly want to kill Cang Shan.

529
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,650
You were just so scared

530
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,430
that you misjudged him.

531
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,680
But this is unfair to Cang Shan.

532
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,110
The grudge and hatred from the past

533
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,740
shouldn't fall solely on his shoulders.

534
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,540
That's right.

535
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,720
Clansmen are also family.

536
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,990
We can't abandon our family

537
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,720
because of fear.

538
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,380
Let Cang Shan go.

539
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,160
That's right.

540
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,300
We're family.

541
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,610
Let him go.

542
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,270
We can't let Cang Shan face it alone!

543
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,870
Let him go!

544
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,980
Let him go.

545
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,300
Go to the Bright Moon Palace with me.

546
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,560
Whether it's the past or present grudge,

547
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,100
we need to put an end to it.

548
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,350
Your legs...

549
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,960
Why did I wait till now

550
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,090
to take revenge on you and the Stone Clan?

551
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,770
My legs were indeed broken.

552
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,470
And I did suffer great pain and torture these years.

553
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,480
Grand Master gave me a chance to stand again.

554
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,640
Master, please allow me

555
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,420
to send a big gift to Fan Yue

556
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,710
and bring back the Contemplation Stone.

557
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,390
I've always been fair in rewarding and punishing people.

558
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,750
Since you have successfully cultivated evil insects

559
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,290
and want to help me bring back the Contemplation Stone,

560
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,530
I'll

561
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,900
help you fulfill a wish too.

562
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,710
My legs...

563
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,550
Come on.

564
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,920
Try to stand.

565
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,820
Come on.

566
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,840
Come on.

567
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,730
How are you feeling?

568
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,430
Thank you, Master.

569
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,800
I won't let you down.

570
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,950
Remember,

571
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,780
people are not afraid of never possessing something,

572
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,980
but of

573
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,750
losing it

574
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,540
after having it.

575
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,940
Chen Ye,

576
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,200
I want you to remember

577
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,070
the feeling of standing.

578
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,010
I hope you

579
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,830
won't lose it.

580
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Yes,

581
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,070
Master.

582
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,190
The spiritual veins in your legs were broken.

583
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,780
The power of eternals or demons can't cure you.

584
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,050
You're doubting the power

585
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,860
of my grand master because you can't do that?

586
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,250
If he had such power,

587
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,580
I would have certainly noticed it.

588
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,360
Grand Master has lived for 1,000 years.

589
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,630
How can you know

590
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,320
all of his secret techniques?

591
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,060
Have you ever thought about this?

592
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,360
You've been in the Cold Spring Palace for many years.

593
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,240
Since he has a way,

594
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,970
why didn't he cure you earlier?

595
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,690
Zhen Yu has ulterior motives.

596
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,720
He's not a good person.

597
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,340
Everything gained comes with a price.

598
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,740
Qi Feng, don't be controlled by him.

599
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,220
I don't need you to tell me if I'm

600
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,710
controlled by Grand Master.

601
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,040
But tonight in the Stone Clan,

602
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,610
everyone is under my control.

603
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,800
Release Cang Shan.

604
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
Let him go.

605
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,020
-Let him go.
-Yes.

606
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,440
-We're family.
-Yeah.

607
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,290
What's wrong with them?

608
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,890
It's the evil insects.

609
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,820
Qi Feng is using the evil insects to control every one of the Stone Clan.

610
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,940
Do you think I came to the Stone Clan

611
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,050
just to act with you?

612
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,870
Before you entered the Stone Clan,

613
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,910
I had already planted an evil insect

614
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,160
in every one of the Stone Clan.

615
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,920
Everyone's life is in my hands,

616
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,710
including yours.

617
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,200
When did you plant it in me?

618
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,320
When your guilt towards me was at its peak

619
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,160
and before you suspected me,

620
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,580
I put it in the food I personally prepared for you.

621
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,610
You're Demon King of the Polar Region and Master of Bright Moon.

622
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,970
Ordinary evil insects won't work on you.

623
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,930
The parent insect in your body

624
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,920
was specially cultivated for you.

625
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,150
No matter how powerful you are,

626
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,210
you can't resist the invasion of the parent insect.

627
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,260
Evil insects can't be extracted.

628
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,010
You can't neutralize it

629
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,090
unless you die.

630
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,460
Bai Shuo, how are you?

631
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,580
I'm fine.

632
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,270
It's just that I've used too much spiritual power and temporarily lost my strength.

633
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,570
Bai Shuo,

634
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,700
did you see something again?

635
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,930
The stone formation.

636
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,220
The stone formation is about to explode.

637
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,480
The Baize Clan's resentment aura is about to be unleashed.

638
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,580
The Baize Clan's resentment aura hates the Stone Clan.

639
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,470
Once it's unleashed,

640
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,070
plus Qi Feng's evil insects,

641
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,090
the Stone Clan will surely perish.

642
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,600
Bai Shuo, you go meet up with Master first.

643
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,220
This is the grudge we brought upon ourselves.

644
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
I'll deal with it.

645
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,090
It's dangerous.

646
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,600
Bai Shuo,

647
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,660
today, I finally realized

648
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,050
my parents had been protecting me.

649
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,730
But apart from disobeying them,

650
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,000
I have never fulfilled my responsibility

651
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,060
as the young master of the Stone Clan.

652
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,090
Now that my parents are gone,

653
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,940
I should be responsible for the Stone Clan.

654
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,490
I can't let anything happen to my clansmen again.

655
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,580
Go to Master.

656
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,460
Don't let anything happen to him!

657
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,350
Cang Shan!

658
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,790
Fan Yue.

659
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,220
You think you can save Cang Shan

660
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,010
by splitting up from Bai Shuo?

661
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,960
Fan Yue,

662
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,090
I want you to kill Cang Shan personally.

663
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,350
Your legs...

664
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,260
You really are the person he likes.

665
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,850
Even your reaction of surprise is the same.

666
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,040
Where is Fan Yue?

667
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,450
What did you do to him?

668
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,130
He has become my weapon.

669
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,560
He will help me kill everyone I want to kill.

670
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,570
Starting...

671
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,110
with Cang Shan.

672
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
With his brother's blood on his hands,

673
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,030
I really want to see

674
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,440
how he will react

675
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,990
when he regains his senses.

676
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,200
You said you don't hate him.

677
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,200
So it was a lie from the beginning.

678
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,180
Since you were forced to take his place back then,

679
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,690
you've been holding a grudge.

680
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,150
Shouldn't I?

681
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,290
I've never experienced what you've been through,

682
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,800
so I'm in no position to speak.

683
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,820
But when you were taken away by the Tiger Clan,

684
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,780
it wasn't what Fan Yue wanted either.

685
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,960
You lost your clansmen,

686
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,889
but so did he.

687
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,590
All these years,

688
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,659
he's felt guilty

689
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,120
and never had peace.

690
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,969
The truth is in this world,

691
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,850
you're not the only one living in pain.

692
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,810
Yeah.

693
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,449
I'm not the only one in this world in misery

694
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,440
and pain.

695
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,260
But why

696
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,570
is he always protected

697
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,659
and chosen?

698
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,360
And I

699
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,139
can only be abandoned and mistreated.

700
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,949
And I could only make myself

701
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,300
a disgusting monster to survive!

702
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,120
But he

703
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,920
is Demon King of the Polar Region and Master of Bright Moon.

704
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,520
All the demons submit to him.

705
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,340
How much pain could he really feel?

706
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,980
Fan Yue's demonic power

707
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,670
was bought with his lifespan.

708
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,580
All these years, he's come this far, risking his own life,

709
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,750
just to avenge the Baize Clan

710
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,000
and find you.

711
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,310
But all you give him in return is hatred.

712
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,300
Isn't he pitiful too?

713
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,950
What do you mean by saying his demonic power

714
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,310
was bought with his lifespan?

715
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,610
How could a boy

716
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,760
become Demon King of the Polar Region

717
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,200
within just a few years?

718
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,680
In order to improve his demonic power quickly,

719
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,780
he forced himself to practice

720
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,080
and suffered a backlash.

721
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,210
He's been tortured by the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

722
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,330
The stronger he is,

723
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,840
the closer he is to death.

724
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,970
Why do you think he wants to activate the Contemplation Stone?

725
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,320
Because only the divine power of the Contemplation Stone

726
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,690
can save his life!

727
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,540
No!

728
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,870
You're lying to me.

729
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,190
He's Demon King.

730
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,590
Why would he sacrifice his life

731
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,920
to avenge the Baize Clan

732
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,050
and find me, whose fate was uncertain?

733
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,900
I've endured humiliation

734
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,260
in the Cold Spring Palace for so many years

735
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,110
just to destroy the Stone Clan

736
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,040
and kill Fan Yue.

737
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,090
I can't be wrong.

738
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,070
I came here by Grand Master's command.

739
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,640
I must take the Contemplation Stone back.

740
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,680
Bai Shuo,

741
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,220
you can't escape.

742
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,220
The stone pillars show no sign of exploding.

743
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,720
It's too late

744
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,780
to escape now.

745
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,290
Yue, don't go.

746
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,590
Yue.

747
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,130
Don't be angry, Yue.

748
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,230
It's my fault.

749
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,330
I shouldn't have teased you and Mei.

750
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,900
Grandfather asked someone to make a new nameplate for you.

751
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,030
But their craftsmanship is not as good as mine.

752
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,600
I made this myself.

753
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,790
[Fan Yue]

754
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,420
Consider it my way of saying sorry.

755
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,910
Don't be angry, okay?

756
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,040
I forgive you this time.

757
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,190
Don't do it again.

758
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,420
â™«What kind of flower would never bear fruit?â™«

759
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,530
I'm going to say it again!

760
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:27,200
â™«What kind of fruit never sees a flower?â™«

761
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,240
Hand over the child with purple pupils!

762
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:37,300
â™«Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of meâ™«

763
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,410
â™«I am the fruit to your flowersâ™«

764
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,040
Why have Qi Feng's eyes become purple?

765
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,230
Grandfather, don't hand over Qi Feng.

766
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,420
Qi Feng! Qi Feng!

767
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,960
â™«Across thousands of milesâ™«

768
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,200
Grandfather, why?

769
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,440
-Qi Feng!
-Grandfather, why?

770
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,410
The child you ask for is here.

771
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,340
â™«The pain of parting lingersâ™«

772
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,000
Good.

773
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,740
-Come here!
-Qi Feng!

774
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Qi Feng!

775
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,150
Grandfather, why?

776
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,340
Qi Feng!

777
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,020
No!

778
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,440
-Qi Feng!
-Grandfather!

779
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,600
Why? Why?

780
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,990
â™«What kind of tree never takes root?â™«

781
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,290
All of you are dead.

782
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,480
I risked my life to escape from the Tiger Clan.

783
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,770
I haven't got the answer from you.

784
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,270
â™«What kind of roots never turn into trees?â™«

785
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,670
How could you all be dead?

786
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,770
You abandoned me.

787
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,230
Who should I

788
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:35,120
â™«To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heartâ™«

789
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,010
hold accountable for this?

790
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,270
How could you be dead?

791
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,110
How could you be dead?

792
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
How could you be dead?

793
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,640
â™«I'm your wandererâ™«

794
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,470
How could you be dead?

795
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,790
How could you be dead?

796
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
Yue.

797
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,360
Why...

798
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,600
is...

799
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,580
is there no Yue's tombstone?

800
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,440
He's not dead.

801
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,940
Yue is still alive!

802
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,160
Yue.

803
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,080
You are not Yue.

804
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,210
Who are you?

805
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,500
What are you doing?

806
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,700
You don't want to accept this?

807
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,620
I can help you.

808
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,150
But I don't like weak people.

809
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,720
I will become a strong person.

810
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,400
Zhen Yu?

811
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,830
This is the Cold Spring Palace.

812
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,250
From today onwards,

813
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,050
your name

814
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,480
will be Chen Ye.

815
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,890
Thank you, Master.

816
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,580
So he is the legendary

817
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,010
Lord Chen Ye

818
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,790
from the Cold Spring Palace.

819
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,040
You all have your own reasons for joining me.

820
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,560
But the Cold Spring Palace is no place for charity.

821
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,070
You have to shed all your

822
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,780
hesitation and weakness,

823
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,530
and become the strongest one

824
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,300
and someone useful to me.

825
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,630
Otherwise,

826
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,850
you know what will happen.

827
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
You may leave.

828
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,740
-Yes, Master.
-Yes, Master.

829
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,590
Xi?

830
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,670
Xi.

831
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,680
Didn't you go traveling with Taoists?

832
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,480
Why were you in the Cold Spring Palace?

833
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Xi!

834
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,790
Xi!

835
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,820
Xi!

836
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,390
Xi!

837
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,350
Xi!

838
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,320
The power of the Contemplation Stone

839
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,450
actually can help you see my memories.

840
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,250
What did you see?

841
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,990
Why is Xi in your memories?

842
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,930
Why was she in the Cold Spring Palace?

843
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,140
What Xi?

844
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,500
When you were given the name by Zhen Yu,

845
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,130
there was a girl with you in the palace.

846
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,900
Where is she?

847
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,020
You want to know where she is?

848
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,030
Sure.

849
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,840
Go to the Cold Spring Palace with me.

850
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,000
Once Fan Yue is dead,

851
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,600
the Cold Spring Palace will hold a dominant position.

852
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,440
Maybe Grand Master will spare your life

853
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,640
if he's in a good mood.

854
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,060
You keep saying you want to kill Fan Yue.

855
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,090
But do you really hate him that much?

856
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,820
Just now in your memories,

857
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,770
I saw some other images.

858
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,890
Qi Feng, remember,

859
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,620
Yue was born extraordinary.

860
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,820
He is not only your brother,

861
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,570
but also

862
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,020
someone you should protect with your life.

863
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,350
Grandfather,

864
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,280
who on earth is Yue?

865
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,520
His identity

866
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,720
can't be revealed.

867
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,460
But you must promise me

868
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,090
you'll protect him.

869
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,930
I will protect Yue.

870
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
I'll protect him with my life.

871
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,760
So,

872
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,560
when you were handed over to the Tiger Clan by your grandfather,

873
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,750
and when you were imprisoned by the Tiger Clan,

874
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,320
you were confused and scared,

875
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,820
but you never told them

876
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,660
Fan Yue was the boy with purple pupils.

877
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,780
Qi Feng,

878
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,750
you don't really hate Fan Yue, do you?
