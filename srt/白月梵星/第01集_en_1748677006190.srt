00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Darkness

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish I was as good as the stars and the moon.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only wish to see every star and moon with the one I love.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's pray for a time.

10
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
We won't fight.

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's live a wonderful life.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,120
whether his good will remains in my dream,

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,780
I remain the same forever.

14
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,100
When I prize my hair on the mountain to get stretched ever.

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,720
With my little Э Lock i open every encourage.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Always this is my gift to you This is my travel Echo

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,780
Beki, my 2023從星惠君身一片手

18
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,640
Deity, my NP alright www

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,720
He'll slowly try to break into three

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,520
The love who was about to fall

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,620
I'll give you my full power

22
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,700
Episode 3

23
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,100
What is it?

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,020
Is this the god's gift?

25
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,160
Appearance

26
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
You're a good cook.

27
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,020
You're a good cook.

28
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
In order to become a good cook,

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,020
he has tried so many dishes.

30
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
He's a great cook.

31
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
He's a good cook.

32
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
He doesn't know how to make a fool of himself.

33
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Uncle Bai!

34
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
You little bastard!

35
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
You're making me suffer again!

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I'm doing this for you!

37
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,020
You're so kind.

38
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Everyone told him

39
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
that there's no god in the world.

40
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
He's the only one who's confident.

41
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Because he has met me.

42
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
No.

43
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
In short, it's me.

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,020
I've met him.

45
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
That night,

46
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
I was playing with my sister Bai Xi

47
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
and sneaked out of the mansion.

48
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
I didn't expect

49
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,020
that the monster would be caught secretly.

50
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
Run!

51
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Run!

52
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Run!

53
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
A'Xu, run!

54
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
I won't leave you!

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
A'Shu, run!

56
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,020
No!

57
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Run!

58
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Run!

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
A'Xu!

60
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
A'Shu, run!

61
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Run!

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,020
I can't believe that I can get

63
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,020
the monster to be caught secretly.

64
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
A'Xu!

65
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,020
A'Xu!

66
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
A'Xu!

67
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
A'Xu!

68
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
A'Xu!

69
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Please save me!

70
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
If time is really clear,

71
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
please save me!

72
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
A'Xu!

73
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
A'Xu!

74
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
A'Xu!

75
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,020
I dare you to feel

76
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,020
that you're going to be killed by the shanhuang.

77
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,020
How much!

78
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
The soul is dead.

79
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,020
It's a hell.

80
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
In this way,

81
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
no one else can change me.

82
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
Zi Yuan!

83
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
You...

84
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
You are...

85
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,020
You are...

86
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
You are...

87
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
You are...

88
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
You are...

89
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
You are...

90
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
You are...

91
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Are you the god?

92
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,020
God, please save A'Xu!

93
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
He's dead.

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,020
I've never asked for the life of the living.

95
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,020
To save you is to destroy the world.

96
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
Please, God!

97
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
Please save A'Xu!

98
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
As long as you save A'Xu,

99
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
I will definitely repay you in the future!

100
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Please, please!

101
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,020
I will repay you!

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
I will repay you.

103
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I will be the next one to be punished.

104
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,020
After a thousand years of suffering,

105
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
you can't live without a human being.

106
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
How can you repay me?

107
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
I can!

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
I will defeat the god and learn the magic.

109
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
I will work hard to live until I die.

110
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
I will be a great god.

111
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
I will repay you in the future.

112
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Please save me!

113
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
Please save me!

114
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
A'Xi!

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
A'Xi!

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
A'Xi, are you okay?

117
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
Uncle A'Xu.

118
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Are you okay?

119
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
You are so great!

120
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Thank you, God!

121
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
The god is not a person who can be connected to the world.

122
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
He is a person who can leave the world.

123
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,020
He has a life and death relationship.

124
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,020
He is a person who can be connected to the world.

125
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
He is a person who can be connected to the world.

126
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,020
He has a life and death relationship.

127
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
Shen Chuan.

128
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
When I woke up,

129
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
A'Xi and I were in bed.

130
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
We asked A'Xi if she remembers the big god.

131
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
She said...

132
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Dad, A'Xi!

133
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Why am I here?

134
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
When did I come back?

135
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
A'Xi, do you remember the big god?

136
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,020
Uncle A'Xu, what are you talking about?

137
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
What god monster?

138
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
I don't know.

139
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
I don't know.

140
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I don't know.

141
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I don't know.

142
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I don't know.

143
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
What god monster?

144
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,020
I... I don't understand.

145
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
What's wrong, uncle?

146
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
Nothing happened.

147
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
What's wrong with you?

148
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
A'Xi forgot everything.

149
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Dad said nothing happened.

150
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,020
And I don't know why I can't remember the idol of Anran.

151
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,020
But I should repay it.

152
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,020
That's my promise to the god.

153
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
After a long time,

154
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
A'Xi was sick due to the river.

155
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,020
The doctor in the city said he was fine.

156
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
How is he?

157
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
I can do nothing about it.

158
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
He's fine.

159
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
A'Xi!

160
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
A'Xi, wake up!

161
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
A'Xi, wake up!

162
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
A'Xi!

163
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
Fortunately, there was a man

164
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,020
who saved his life.

165
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Xier, I'm begging you.

166
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,020
This kid is very brave.

167
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Only by far away from the mortal world

168
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
can he grow up safely.

169
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
The Taoist said

170
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
A'Xi is brave.

171
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Only by far away from the mortal world

172
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
can he grow up safely.

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Dad, to protect A'Xi's life,

174
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
he had to endure the pain

175
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,020
and let him leave with the Taoist.

176
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
I don't want to

177
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,020
be a hero no more.

178
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
A'Xi!

179
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
A'Xi!

180
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
A'Xi!

181
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
A'Xi!

182
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
Everyone said

183
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
that the two daughters of the White City

184
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
were lost.

185
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,020
One was being shy all day long.

186
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
No one understood me.

187
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Even my dad didn't understand me.

188
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
But even so,

189
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,020
my life was still

190
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
settled down.

191
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
That's right.

192
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Yes.

193
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
His name is Chongzhao.

194
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,020
He is the son of the Mantho Pujia next door.

195
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
When we met,

196
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,020
his parents were separated.

197
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,020
My dad took him to the City Hall

198
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
and took care of him like his own son.

199
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
He took care of him.

200
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
My dad looked at this kid.

201
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
We'll be together in the future.

202
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
He had to marry me.

203
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Okay.

204
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Chongzhao has been nice to me.

205
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
He never left my dream.

206
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
He just gave me a big head.

207
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
My dad said

208
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
that we'll be family in the future.

209
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
That's right.

210
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
A family

211
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
may not be husband and wife.

212
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
But we can be siblings.

213
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
I've never been married.

214
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
I never mentioned it.

215
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
It's been a year and a half.

216
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Family's meaning

217
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
and family's meaning

218
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
may be in this simple everyday life.

219
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Many things have changed in the past ten years.

220
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
But some things haven't changed in the past.

221
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
For example,

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I've been married for ten years.

223
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,020
I've made many decisions.

224
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
For example,

225
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Chief Sun,

226
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
we've been in a relationship for ten years.

227
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Let's break up.

228
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Chief Chen told me

229
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
that I can't come back with you.

230
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Otherwise, I'll beat my head off.

231
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Save me, Mr. Xu.

232
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,020
I'll give you the accostation.

233
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Please leave.

234
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
Leave?

235
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
The modern rules

236
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
and rules

237
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
are the same.

238
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
The city of Nian

239
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
has to follow my rules.

240
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,020
If you don't tell me the truth today,

241
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,020
I'll smash your Taoist Temple with my father.

242
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
I'll smash him, not you.

243
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Still hurt?

244
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
Alright.

245
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,020
This secret has been hidden in my heart for many years.

246
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Even if you can see your heart today,

247
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,020
I'll tell you about it.

248
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Tell me.

249
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,020
For the sake of protecting the people,

250
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,020
every single one of the gods will send a immortal to watch over you.

251
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
If you find this person,

252
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,020
and you can touch him with your heart,

253
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,020
he'll take your eyes off you and you'll be able to enter the Immortal's door.

254
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I can tell you with all my heart,

255
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
he'll be able to see your true identity.

256
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Who is he?

257
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
He is...

258
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Master Buji!

259
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Nice!

260
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,200
Your new flowerIND?

261
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,180
It's nice.

262
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
While flowers are green,

263
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,020
to attract more people to live in the city.

264
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Master, we've been in Ning'an for a month.

265
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Now the city is full of chaos.

266
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,020
You're a very beautiful person.

267
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,020
You've been in the city for a long time.

268
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Why don't you choose one or two of them?

269
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,020
A group of ordinary people are also suitable for this store.

270
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
Other than the five-year-old,

271
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,020
there's no other way.

272
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Why are you still standing here?

273
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Go and give me a drink.

274
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Me?

275
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Since you're from the human race,

276
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
you must follow the rules of the human race.

277
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,020
You must take care of the guests in the open.

278
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Go.

279
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,020
I'll go.

280
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,020
The God of the universe attracts people.

281
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
It's a business man.

282
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,020
Why do you keep making fun of me like this?

283
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
The cause is the same.

284
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Everyone knows he's the God.

285
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
He's always looking for his immortal.

286
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
That's amazing.

287
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
That's right.

288
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,020
But you said that he came to Ning'an for a month.

289
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
I don't have any relationship with him.

290
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Since no one is here,

291
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
why would he come to see me?

292
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Since you're from the same family,

293
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
why don't you come with me?

294
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
No, no, no.

295
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,020
The Immortal is a great man.

296
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
If you leave,

297
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
you'll be in trouble.

298
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
As long as I'm in the Immortal,

299
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I won't forget your guidance today.

300
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
But if you're going to make fun of me...

301
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
No.

302
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Definitely not.

303
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
That's good.

304
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Hurry up.

305
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
I'll clean up.

306
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
I won't stay here for long.

307
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Hurry up.

308
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Master, didn't you tell Miss Bai

309
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
that you're going to leave the Immortal?

310
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Why did you still run away?

311
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Why would I leave the Immortal?

312
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
How could a living immortal

313
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
have seen his true face

314
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
for a month?

315
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
Okay.

316
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
That's true.

317
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
He's a good man.

318
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
He's always been a good man.

319
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
He's always been a good man.

320
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Master, I'm not good at this.

321
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I'm just trying to save time.

322
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
I'm just trying to save time.

323
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm just trying to save time.

324
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Don't let him find out that I'm lying to him.

325
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Hurry up.

326
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

327
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Hurry up.

328
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Hurry up.

329
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Hurry up.

330
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Master,

331
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,020
are you the little one from the City Master?

332
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
Yes.

333
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
He's...

334
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Why is he here?

335
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Yes.

336
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Why is he here?

337
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Immortal,

338
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
living in this place,

339
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020
this painting is too much.

340
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Why does it feel like a monster?

341
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
This is the first time

342
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
that I've seen a guest face.

343
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
You want a Jiangnan girl

344
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
or a Mobei Wuji?

345
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
I don't know.

346
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I don't know.

347
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
I don't know.

348
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
I don't know.

349
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
I don't know.

350
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
What a rare guest face.

351
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
I don't know

352
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
what kind of person

353
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
the Tower Master is.

354
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm Bai Shuo.

355
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Qianjin Wanbao is here.

356
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Please meet the Tower Master.

357
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Meet the Tower Master?

358
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Bring Qianjin Wanbao

359
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
to the Tower Master every day.

360
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
There's not one hundred,

361
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
but eighty.

362
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Go.

363
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
My precious

364
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
is different from

365
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
the ordinary people.

366
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Open it.

367
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
What?

368
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm not just the City Master.

369
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,020
I've been talking about the world for a long time.

370
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
These are all the treasures

371
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I've searched for

372
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
to make a monster.

373
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Today,

374
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
I came here to meet the Tower Master.

375
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
How about it?

376
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
I'll be a group.

377
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
I won't invite you

378
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
to meet the Tower Master.

379
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
You said you wanted to make a monster.

380
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
The Tower Master.

381
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
This is the fairy?

382
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
She's even more handsome than me.

383
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Tower Master.

384
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Tower Master.

385
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
Everyone, please hurry.

386
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
The Tower Master is here.

387
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
You've just killed me.

388
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
I...

389
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Who's the answer?

390
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

391
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
Who's the answer?

392
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

393
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
I don't like to make trouble.

394
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Especially the people.

395
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
You're even more crazy.

396
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
You're even more mad at me.

397
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
You said

398
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
you wanted to kill the monster.

399
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,020
Yes, it's me.

400
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
You came to my place.

401
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
You're so generous.

402
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,020
You really have a good plan.

403
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,020
What's your name?

404
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Bai Shu.

405
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
I've been asking for your help.

406
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
I've been so excited.

407
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,020
I've been so patient.

408
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
I've been so focused on drawing and painting.

409
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
I've been so focused on drawing and painting.

410
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
If you don't believe me,

411
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
you can ask me.

412
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Do you dare to ask me

413
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,020
if I can make it through the sky?

414
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
Do you dare to ask me?

415
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

416
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
You dare to ask me?

417
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

418
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
You're going to use this method?

419
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
I thought it was a stupid trick.

420
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
But it's a common person.

421
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
So what?

422
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
Is this the spirit of the immortal?

423
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Yes.

424
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Immortal, I'm learning the right thing.

425
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Dian Chu, this is a human group.

426
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
We can't kill them.

427
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,360
Imp speaker,

428
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,020
see you next time.

429
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,280
ón

430
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,020
Are you coming?

431
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,580
Yes,

432
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,020
absolutely.

433
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,520
You're alive?

434
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
The first round of the Lanling Fairy Sect

435
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
will be held for a long time.

436
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
It's rare to see such a big event today.

437
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Next, please welcome our leader,

438
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Mr. Liang.

439
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Are you okay?

440
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
It's okay.

441
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Everyone, please come to the table.

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Please come to the table.

443
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Everyone, please come to the table.

444
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Sect Leader,

445
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
can we find a place to complete the discussion

446
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
in the next ceremony?

447
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Every ceremony is not just a gala.

448
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
It's just a sun-dried fish.

449
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Exactly.

450
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,520
You know the light in this door.

451
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,520
The wind blows the sun, but I won't let you be caught in the rain.

452
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Look.

453
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
It's already prepared.

454
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Now, it's time to begin.

455
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
These are the city's most famous and most popular places.

456
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
All the public relations are very strong.

457
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Sir,

458
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
although we are from the outside,

459
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,520
we are also businessmen from the open shop.

460
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
There are many missing people in the city.

461
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
We are just traveling around the city.

462
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Although there are no missing people in the city,

463
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
we can't be absent from the future.

464
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
That's natural.

465
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
We are all two meters away.

466
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
We haven't finished the discussion.

467
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
You little thief!

468
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Did you take the medicine from the kitchen?

469
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
You are not good at rest.

470
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,520
You are using my gold to go to the brothel and find the little official.

471
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Can you do me a favor?

472
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Can you do me a favor?

473
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Father, it's not that serious.

474
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
I have a business here.

475
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
What business do you have?

476
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Stop right there!

477
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Have I finished the discussion?

478
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
You little thief.

479
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
You are good looking.

480
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
You are quite tall.

481
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Don't look like a human dog.

482
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
You actually are a little official?

483
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
You are disgusting!

484
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
You are a scoundrel!

485
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Let me tell you.

486
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
You want to stay in Ning'an City?

487
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Stay away from my daughter!

488
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Don't move.

489
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Don't move.

490
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
We can't use the waist in front of the people.

491
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Father, we can't offend him.

492
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
What if I offend him?

493
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
I will make you pay for it!

494
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
The five-year-old is...

495
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
in pain.

496
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I am not a scoundrel.

497
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Let go of my hand!

498
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Do you believe that I have given you the chance to go to the brothel?

499
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
It's not the right time.

500
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Wait for me.

501
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I will come to you again.

502
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
No more!

503
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Father, it's not your business.

504
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
What business?

505
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Stay away from me.

506
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
I have given you the chance to go to the brothel.

507
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I will make you pay for it.

508
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Shut up!

509
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I will go to the brothel.

510
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Let's go.

511
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
All right.

512
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
This is the end of the first-time ceremony.

513
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I will take you all to the brothel.

514
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
I just reported the invitation.

515
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I will reply later.

516
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,520
But there is one thing that I am worried about.

517
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I want to discuss with you.

518
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
There is one more thing that I am worried about.

519
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I want to discuss with you.

520
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
The fire is about to be extinguished.

521
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
All right.

522
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
I will tell you the truth.

523
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
You all remember the five-year-old.

524
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,520
The goddess of the Star Moon was always in the brothel.

525
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
She has been in the brothel for more than ten years.

526
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
She is a watchman.

527
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Maybe she is just a playboy.

528
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
She is just a loser.

529
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Let's see.

530
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
What?

531
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
She is a loser.

532
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
She is a loser.

533
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
She is a loser.

534
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
She is a loser.

535
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
She is a loser.

536
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
She is a goddess.

537
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
She is a loser.

538
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
You need to explain it clearly.

539
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
What is it?

540
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
You need to explain it clearly.

541
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Yes.

542
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Yes.

543
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Explain it clearly.

544
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Explain it clearly.

545
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Explain it clearly.

546
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Everyone knows that

547
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,520
the five-year-old was the goddess of the Star Moon.

548
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Although she has been in the brothel for a long time,

549
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
she can't show her power.

550
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,520
But she is the goddess of our ancestors.

551
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
She is also the face of our Lanling.

552
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,520
So we have been keeping her in the secret room.

553
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
We dare not disturb her.

554
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Last month, she actually found out that she is a loser.

555
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,520
And the only thing she can show is the spirit of the demons.

556
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
The demons have been fighting in our house.

557
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
We are doomed.

558
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
They are useless.

559
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
But at least they are the face of Lanling.

560
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
We can't let this go.

561
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
We can't let this go.

562
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
We can't let this go.

563
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
We can't let this go.

564
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
I am just like your idea.

565
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
But look at it.

566
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
We have a short-term shortage of money.

567
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
We have a lot of people.

568
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
There are many things that can't be missed.

569
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Anyway, if you find the clues of the five-year-old in Xiaxia's city,

570
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,520
you can go back to the door.

571
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
No.

572
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
The demons are too naive.

573
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
We have to go to the demons to find the way.

574
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
We can't go there.

575
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
We have to find the way.

576
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
We have to find the way.

577
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
They are too naive.

578
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
We have to go.

579
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
We have to go.

580
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
You guys are so stupid.

581
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
This is our team.

582
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Get on.

583
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,720
Fifteen years of losing,

584
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,520
sulphurs on Lanling

585
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
must face a lockdown.

586
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,520
They ask the demons to make some kind of plan.

587
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,520
But if the demon gets take it back,

588
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,080
we will definitely

589
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,520
kill Lanling very soon.

590
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Only I have

591
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
the great result.

592
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Yun Bao!

593
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Come here!

594
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Oh!

595
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Zhang Bai!

596
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
After I leave,

597
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
the weak Blue Spirit

598
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
and the world's heavy burden

599
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
will be given to you and

600
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
the people of Wei State.

601
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Please!

602
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Master!

603
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Master!

604
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Master!

605
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Master!

606
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Master!

607
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
How lucky you are!

608
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Are you really going to

609
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
take over the sect for this?

610
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Master!

611
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
You're not even taking it seriously!

612
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
You're so mean!

613
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Master, I...

614
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm leaving!

615
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I'm leaving!

616
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Master!

617
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Master!

618
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Master!

619
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Master!

620
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Master!

621
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Master!

622
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Zhang Bai!

623
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Everyone, please get off.

624
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Chong Zhao, please have a chat.

625
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Let's go.

626
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Chong Zhao,

627
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
you've been promoted as a teacher.

628
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Come, let's get up.

629
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Kneel down.

630
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Did you make a mistake?

631
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Did you know that you made a mistake?

632
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
You must be more strict with me, right?

633
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Did you make a mistake?

634
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Did you make a mistake?

635
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
You!

636
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm busy with my work.

637
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I don't have time to teach you.

638
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I didn't expect you to be so useless

639
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
and make trouble everywhere.

640
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Don't think that I don't know

641
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
that you're making trouble in the daytime

642
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
and you're still working at the night.

643
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Is this something that a girl should do?

644
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm a girl.

645
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
But I'm also myself.

646
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I know what I'm doing.

647
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
Before you do it,

648
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
do you still remember your mother's health?

649
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Do you remember today is her birthday?

650
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Yes.

651
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
You've been doing this all these years.

652
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Do you still remember anything?

653
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
What are you still concerned about?

654
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I've told you many times that you're giving up.

655
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
You just don't listen.

656
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
You used to jump and jump,

657
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
but you're still a good girl.

658
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,520
But now, you're being so stubborn and arrogant.

659
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Today,

660
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
in this hall,

661
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
I want you to start

662
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
and completely stop Xiu Xian's idea.

663
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Otherwise,

664
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll break your relationship with your father and daughter.

665
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
It's easy to swear.

666
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
But I don't want to be a liar to my mother.

667
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,520
I want Xiu Xian to be a blessing.

668
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
This is my wish in this life.

669
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,520
No matter how many years and how many people oppose me,

670
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
I won't give up.

671
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Even if you don't give up with my father,

672
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
answer me!

673
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Yes.

674
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Remember what you said.

675
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
From now on, don't care about me and my father.

676
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
You didn't hear me?

677
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Just stop this now.

678
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,840
We've walked through so many places

679
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
having a try at urgent care.

680
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,680
We've never changed.

681
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,280
We now know

682
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,780
who set to take onapo.

683
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,560
Do you remember

684
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,280
That's the purpose of the human clan.

685
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
Of course, you remember.

686
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,160
The Five-Ninus Stone is the ancient stone.

687
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,000
The gods of the Star Moon Goddess of the Night Clan

688
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,160
were weak in the God's War 60,000 years ago.

689
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,920
The Five-Ninus Stone is in the God's War.

690
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
No one can open it.

691
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,200
It's said that as long as the world is in a hurry,

692
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080
love, hate, kill,

693
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,800
greed, kindness, and five-nus,

694
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,080
the Five-Ninus Stone can be re-enact.

695
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,960
The Five-Nus Stone will be left in the Five-Nus Stone.

696
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
The opening and closing doors

697
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
are to absorb the evil of the people.

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

699
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,280
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

700
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,160
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

701
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,200
Come on, come on, come on...

702
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,960
Come on, come on...

703
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,440
Theчem歉

704
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,480
Its職孀

705
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,480
Is for death

706
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,300
달�us

707
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Happy

708
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
Sad

709
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,760
ivity

710
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,480
People

711
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,600
I miss him

712
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
impunity

713
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,280
fear

714
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
reunion

715
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,980
greed

716
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,580
All these emotions discussed in life

717
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,480
I thought as long as there is one aspect with the people

718
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,260
in one's life

719
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,600
liking

720
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,600
But now it seems that this Bai Shu is the key.

721
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,600
How about we tie him up?

722
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Idiot. Bai Shu is the daughter of the City Master.

723
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Ning'an City is the place where the Blue Spirit Immortal Sect protects.

724
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
If we ask for a big deal, we will report the Immortal Sect first.

725
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
The Sect Leader's sect will surely reveal it.

726
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
But you are the King of the Demon King, the Princess of the House of the Moon.

727
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Unless it's the God Clan that is back to life,

728
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
the Immortal and Demon Clan of the Now is no match for you.

729
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Why do we need to be afraid of the Blue Spirit Immortal Sect?

730
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
I don't like trouble.

731
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
The sect in Jingyou Mountain and Lengquan Palace

732
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
are looking for the key to my store.

733
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
If they know that the Immortal is in our hands,

734
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
the whole of the sect will be destroyed.

735
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
The City Master is very far away.

736
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I admire you, City Master.

737
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Do you want to hear this?

738
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
What does the City Master mean?

739
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
He means that Wu Nian is very likely to have one of his own thoughts

740
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
when he has the reaction of Bai Shu.

741
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I will go to City Master's mansion to check it out.

742
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
I... I will go too.

743
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Bai Shu...

744
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
is a little interesting.

745
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Mother, I'm sorry.

746
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I forgot about you.

747
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
It's not like what you said.

748
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I don't want to make Father angry.

749
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
But mother,

750
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
if it wasn't for that Immortal,

751
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
I and Xi would have died long ago.

752
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
We were living in the same world.

753
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
We were living in the same world.

754
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
We were living in the same world.

755
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
We were living in the same world.

756
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
How many people don't know why we are living?

757
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
But I know myself.

758
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I want to be the Immortal to repay my kindness.

759
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,600
That's my promise to the Immortal.

760
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I should repay my kindness.

761
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Xi lost his reputation and died.

762
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I will repay his kindness.

763
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Everyone can say I'm a fool.

764
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm a fool.

765
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
But if I'm angry with Noyan,

766
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,600
then it's really different from dying.

767
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
You're right.

768
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Mother.

769
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Yesterday, I and your uncle went to the west bank.

770
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
We found a monster in Ning'an City.

771
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,600
But we didn't find out the exact location.

772
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
You're the Immortal to be responsible for Ning'an City.

773
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,600
You should be careful when you go back.

774
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Don't worry, master. I understand.

775
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,600
You're the most capable disciple of me.

776
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,600
You're very young and mature.

777
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,600
You've become a teacher.

778
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,600
So I have an important thing to tell you.

779
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Master, but you should find out the location of Noyan.

780
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
No, I just want to ask

781
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,600
what's the business of the secret shop in Ning'an City?

782
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Is there a profit?

783
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,600
The main thing is that the human race is too rich recently.

784
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Plus, the house is old and broken.

785
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
We need to repair it.

786
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Master, we're the Immortals.

787
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Why don't we use the Immortals?

788
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,600
The Immortals have been building the temple for a hundred years.

789
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,600
So we decided to use the Immortals' location.

790
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
We can't use the magic.

791
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
But we're the Immortals' location.

792
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Of course, we're used to it.

793
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
If we try to use the Immortals' location,

794
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
the Immortals will be in trouble if we don't use the Immortals.

795
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,600
If we let the Immortals catch the sick and lead the people to the grave,

796
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
it'll be great.

797
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
What if the Immortals don't follow the promise and ruin the people?

798
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Can't we use the Immortals' location?

799
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Don't worry.

800
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,600
The demons are not weak in the inside.

801
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Even if they want to ruin the people,

802
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
they won't have the physical strength.

803
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Master, I still think that...

804
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,600
60,000 years ago, the Immortals were in the grave.

805
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Now, the world is in danger.

806
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Now, the world is in the hands of the Immortals.

807
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
And you are the most beloved disciple of the government.

808
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600
So the importance of the world's creation...

809
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,600
can only be in your shoulders.

810
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Master, don't worry.

811
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
I will surely follow the teachers' instructions.

812
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Don't use the magic to cover up the grave.

813
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Don't let the creation down.

814
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
It's really hard on you.

815
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Go back to the city.

816
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
No.

817
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,600
What a pure child.

818
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Yes.

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,600
But what's the relationship between the world and the money?

820
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Why is it not?

821
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
The demons are in chaos.

822
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Especially the Cold Palace is in a pure movement.

823
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
This person and I are very close.

824
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
We are not always in a strong position.

825
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Look, this war is going to be a big one sooner or later.

826
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
You've heard that there's no war without cold grass.

827
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
You can win.

828
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
We can stop the enemy.

829
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
We can attack the enemy.

830
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
We can kill the Immortals.

831
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I will kill them.

832
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Fire.

833
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Immortals, don't you dare to know.

834
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Immortals.

835
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Immortals.

836
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Are you okay?

837
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
You are?

838
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I am the Immortals.

839
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I have passed the cloud.

840
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Thank you for saving me.

841
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
No need to thank me.

842
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
The demons are in a dire situation.

843
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
They will help us.

844
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,600
I heard the demon general mention the Five-Thousand-Eight.

845
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Is it because of this?

846
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes.

847
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Everyone knows that the Five-Thousand-Eight has been in the Blue Forest.

848
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Why did he ask this?

849
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Immortals have no idea.

850
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
The Five-Thousand-Eight was stolen long ago.

851
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Stolen?

852
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Who stole it?

853
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I don't know who it is.

854
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I only know that it was the demons.

855
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
The demons?

856
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
But there are more clues.

857
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
No more.

858
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,600
There are no other clues.

859
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
I didn't ask you to live.

860
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Master.

861
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
You are the new one.

862
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
You can't wait for him to get away from here.

863
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
You can't wait for him to get away from here.

864
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Don't worry.

865
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
When Master killed his own people,

866
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
it was quite easy.

867
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Shut up.

868
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
The Five-Thousand-Eight has been in the Blue Forest.

869
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I can't even get it in easily.

870
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
It's a coincidence that Wu Shengxi stole the demon.

871
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm afraid there is only one person in this world.

872
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
The Hall of the Moon.

873
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Yes, that Fan Yue.

874
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,600
He used the magic chain to break my waist.

875
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,600
He broke my ability to repair it to the top level.

876
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I will make him pay for this.

877
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600
I have already put the flower-dress in the Blue Forest.

878
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Hurry up.

879
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I will investigate the Five-Thousand-Eight.

880
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I will hide the door and the Hall of the Moon.

881
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Even if I can't let them come in,

882
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I can at least do my best.

883
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Yes.

884
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
You are hungry?

885
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I'm just saying.

886
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Some people are so arrogant.

887
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Why can't they be eaten?

888
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
I'm hungry.

889
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Didn't Zhao say he was going out for business?

890
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Why hasn't he come back yet?

891
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
When some people went to the Blue Forest,

892
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,600
we didn't think of having a fiancee named Zhao.

893
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I didn't go to the Blue Forest.

894
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
That's not the Blue Forest.

895
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Some people don't have to explain to me.

896
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
I have already broken my relationship with some people.

897
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
I don't know what to do.

898
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
I have already broken my relationship with some women.

899
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Where do you want to go?

900
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Xu Zao!

901
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Where do you want to go?

902
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
You said that.

903
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
What do you think?

904
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
That white-haired man is indeed the one who is the leader of the Blue Forest.

905
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
During the past ten years, he has been looking for a fiancee,

906
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
but he has no fruit.

907
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
People call him Xian Chi.

908
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Xian Chi?

909
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
He can let Wu Nian Shi shine.

910
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't believe that he is just a normal person.

911
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Unless the owner of the shop saw it wrong last night.

912
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Wu Nian Shi actually didn't shine.

913
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
But this kind of possibility may not exist.

914
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
I'll go get him back.

915
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Let you interrogate him.

916
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
No need.

917
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
He has already come.

918
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
Master, I'm here to find you.

919
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Let's continue what we did last night.

920
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Master,

921
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,600
it's a question of catching him.

922
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
I'm not sure if he is the one who is the fiancee.

923
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I don't know.

924
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Master,

925
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
is it a question of catching him

926
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
or just going out?

927
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
This is the human clan.

928
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Take your temper.

929
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Don't mess with me.

930
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
What is the need for him to ask for a question?

931
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
I just need to pretend to be a fairy.

932
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
Let him believe me.

933
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
He has the right to ask, to answer, to give orders, to hide.

934
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
If you want to test his emotions,

935
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
can you do it without thinking?

936
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
It's impossible.

937
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
The style of this snake-eared snake,

938
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
the way it looks,

939
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
is it really a fairy?

940
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
We need to find out.

941
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
The one standing in the distance.

942
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Don't be afraid.

943
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
The stars will guide you to the desert.

944
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Come on.

945
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Come on.

946
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
My heart is beating fast.

947
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Come on.

948
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Come on.

949
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Come on.

950
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Come on.

951
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Come on.

952
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Come on.

953
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Come on.

954
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,600
My heart is beating so fast.

955
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,600
Wait for me.

956
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,600
The stars are shining brightly.

957
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,600
You are the light I want to see.

958
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,600
You are the only way.

959
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:13,600
Let this moment be with you.

960
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Let the universe be with you.

961
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:27,600
The stars are shining brightly.

962
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,600
You are the blue earth I want to see.

963
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,600
Let the universe be with you.

964
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Let the universe be with you.

965
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:52,600
Let the universe be with you.

966
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Let the universe be with you.
