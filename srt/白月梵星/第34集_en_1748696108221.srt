1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
What if it means to burst more or less?

2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,580
Are you okay?

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,480
Before you met me you said your wife is around the corner.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,580
ashed out Roland Liar

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,580
I am willing to be like a star, and the army is willing to be like a moon.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,580
The world is there, and we are there.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,580
What is the meaning of a flower that never ends?

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:49,580
What is the meaning of a flower that never ends?

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:57,580
What is the meaning of a flower that never ends?

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:06,580
I only want to watch every star day with the one I love.

11
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I want to be with you forever.

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,580
The fairy demon is a book, and you and her are not the same person.

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,580
The fairy was born to be abird, and he was born to go to heaven.

14
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,580
The fountains will last for sentient beings.

15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:50,580
You know your reasons for being a bird.

16
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,580
I will live my life without you.

17
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,580
I will live my life without you.

18
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,580
The flower in the wind, the water in the water.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I will die together with you.

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
I will die everywhere.

21
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,580
I will live my life without you.

22
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,580
I will die everywhere.

23
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,580
I will die together with you.

24
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,580
I will die everywhere.

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
I will die everywhere.

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
I will die everywhere.

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,580
I will die everywhere.

28
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
I will die everywhere.

29
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
I will die everywhere.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,580
I will die everywhere.

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
I will die everywhere.

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,580
I will die everywhere.

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,580
I will die everywhere.

34
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
I will die everywhere.

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I will die everywhere.

36
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
I will die everywhere.

37
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
I will die everywhere.

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
I will die everywhere.

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I will die everywhere.

40
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
You are here.

41
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
I will stop here.

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,580
There is another big thing in the store.

43
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
I will die everywhere.

44
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
Everyone, let's go.

45
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
Let's go.

46
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,580
Miss Bai, this is the flower the owner prepared for you.

47
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
He prepared the light for me.

48
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
He prepared these for me.

49
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,580
He prepared these for me.

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Now it seems that there is some misunderstanding.

51
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Why do you have a misunderstanding?

52
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
It is very good.

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,580
You don't want to see me.

54
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
You don't want me to see you.

55
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
What?

56
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
I have never seen you.

57
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
What?

58
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
I have never seen you before.

59
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Are you in love?

60
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,580
You are my destiny.

61
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
I am the light of you.

62
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,580
It's a good thing I'm here.

63
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,580
I'll take care of it.

64
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Okay.

65
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
We'll go to the temple now.

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I'll come back.

67
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,580
Okay.

68
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
I'll go back.

69
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
Okay.

70
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
I'll go back.

71
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Okay.

72
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Okay.

73
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
Okay.

74
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I'll go back.

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
I'll go back.

76
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,580
Will you marry me?

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
To be honest,

78
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
I can meet Fan Yu.

79
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
Love Fan Yu

80
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,580
is also my life.

81
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,580
The luckiest thing.

82
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
In the sky,

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
in the earth,

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
in the face,

85
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580
one person is one star.

86
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580
One person is one star.

87
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,580
One person is one star.

88
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
I can't live without you.

89
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
You've taken my life.

90
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
You're my person.

91
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Okay.

92
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,580
Give me some help.

93
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
I can't live without you.

94
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,580
One person is one star.

95
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
One person is one star.

96
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
I can't live without you.

97
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
I can't live without you.

98
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Miss Bai, why are you crying?

99
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Yes, Miss Bai.

100
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Why are you crying?

101
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm fine.

102
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm just so happy.

103
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,580
From now on,

104
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,580
you must listen to me.

105
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
I must listen to me too.

106
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
I'm the owner of the Hall of Fame.

107
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Today is Hall of Fame's celebration.

108
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Everyone is playing the game.

109
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
I'm so happy.

110
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,580
I won't go back.

111
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Okay.

112
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,580
I'm so happy.

113
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Master.

114
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
You...

115
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
don't have anything to say to me?

116
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
I don't believe it.

117
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
I don't believe it.

118
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Why is it that

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,580
I'm going to destroy everything

120
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,580
when I'm the most beautiful?

121
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,580
There must be another way.

122
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm going to the Hall of Fame

123
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
to get the medicine.

124
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Don't go.

125
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,580
The Hall of Fame is on the night of the celebration.

126
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
The last day

127
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
is the last day

128
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
that I and he spent well.

129
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
Brother, you'll die.

130
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
The Hall of Fame can't be without the Hall of Fame.

131
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
The Hall of Fame can't be without

132
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
is never me.

133
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
It's you.

134
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,580
No matter it's you,

135
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
Cang Shan,

136
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,580
or any of them,

137
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
it's not worth it

138
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,580
to live for the sake of the Hall of Fame.

139
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Instead, it's worth

140
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
doing what you want

141
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
with your own heart.

142
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
No.

143
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
Our heart is chasing the Hall of Fame.

144
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
But my heart

145
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
is hoping that

146
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
you'll have what you want.

147
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
You'll have what you want.

148
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
You'll have what you want.

149
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
You'll have what you want.

150
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
You'll have what you want.

151
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
The Hall of Fame

152
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
is on the night of the celebration.

153
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
The Hall of Fame

154
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,580
is the place

155
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
that we spent our lives together.

156
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,580
The Hall of Fame

157
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
is on the night of the celebration.

158
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
We both have a chance

159
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
to know what it is.

160
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
I am not.

161
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Am I not?

162
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
Every time I come here,

163
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,580
when I am in a bad mood,

164
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,580
I have never really experienced the scenery before.

165
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
I have never thought that other places

166
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,580
would have such a lively and lively mood.

167
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
Shuang,

168
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
because of you,

169
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,580
I can see such a scene

170
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,580
and understand the meaning of life.

171
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
We still have a chance.

172
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,580
I was in a hurry to take revenge.

173
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Now I realize that

174
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I still have a lot of things to do.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
What do you want to do?

176
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Tell me.

177
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
I hope that this good night

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,580
will always be like today.

179
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,580
I love you and I love you.

180
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,580
I hope that time

181
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
will take care of the struggle.

182
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,580
I also want to see the beautiful scenery on the road.

183
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,580
I also want to go to the South Sea to see the ice.

184
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,580
I also want to go to the wind and see the fairy tale.

185
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
I also want to go to the floating island

186
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
to see the red and the red mountains.

187
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Shuang,

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,580
please listen to me about these things, okay?

189
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Okay?

190
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
The South Sea is warm.

191
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Ice is hard to hold.

192
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
The Wutong Flower really

193
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,580
has only been opened for 30 years.

194
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
The oldest lake in the world

195
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
hasn't reached 10,000 years.

196
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,580
I want to complete anything.

197
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,580
At least for more than ten years.

198
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
Fanyuan,

199
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,580
I know your intention.

200
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,580
You want me to live well, right?

201
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,580
You are still as smart as the past.

202
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,580
Then the last sheep's wool,

203
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,580
are you as weak or not?

204
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Don't worry.

205
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I'm so smart.

206
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
I won't do anything stupid.

207
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
I will live well.

208
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,580
I will live long.

209
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
That's good.

210
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm afraid Shuang will be scared.

211
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm afraid Shuang will be scared.

212
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Shuang,

213
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
I've been

214
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
in the Wutong Flower Star Formation.

215
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
The Wutong Flower is a poem.

216
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
I've been through every single gift

217
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
with you.

218
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
I will always be by your side.

219
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Shuang,

220
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
I love you.

221
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
I will always be by your side.

222
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
I will always be by your side.

223
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
I will always be by your side.

224
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
I will always be by your side.

225
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
I will always be by your side.

226
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I will always be by your side.

227
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I will always be by your side.

228
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I will always be by your side.

229
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I will always be by your side.

230
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
I will always be by your side.

231
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I will always be by your side.

232
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
I will always be by your side.

233
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,580
I will always be by your side.

234
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,580
I will always be by your side.

235
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
I will always take good care of you.

236
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
I will be by your side.

237
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
I will always be by your side.

238
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
I will always be by your side.

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
I will always be by your side.

240
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
I promise.

241
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
I promise.

242
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Yueyin Sea.

243
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
My consciousness has come to Yueyin Sea again?

244
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
You are finally here.

245
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
It's you?

246
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Who are you?

247
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Is it Xian, Shiyao or God?

248
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,580
I am God when I enter the God Realm.

249
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
To be honest,

250
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
I am the most famous and most beautiful person in the night clan.

251
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
The God of the Night Clan.

252
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
Since you are God,

253
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
send me out of the God Realm as soon as possible.

254
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
Can you save the Moon?

255
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
This is not the God Realm.

256
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:32,140
The Five-Year

257
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
No matter what place it is,

258
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
what secret it is,

259
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
no matter why you have this kind of concern,

260
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
no matter why you pretend to know my benefactor.

261
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,580
At this moment,

262
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,580
I only hope that the Moon can live.

263
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580
Can you save her?

264
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
She is dead.

265
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,580
She is in a deep soul.

266
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
I can't save her.

267
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
You are not a god.

268
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Why can't you save her?

269
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Because 60,000 years ago,

270
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
I was already dead.

271
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Now I am just a soul.

272
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
To protect the Moon,

273
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,580
to protect the soul that exists for you.

274
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
You are dead?

275
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Yes.

276
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,580
My existence is just for you.

277
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,580
I have been waiting for you here.

278
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
When you are in the Five-Year,

279
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
you really come here for a day.

280
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
To be honest,

281
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
you only understand the meaning of the Moon and the sea.

282
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Then you can break the God Realm

283
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
and break the God Realm

284
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
and return to reality

285
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,580
to do everything you should.

286
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,580
I have been through so many things.

287
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,580
I have been through countless life and death.

288
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I have lost the one I love.

289
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Even if I understand everything now

290
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
and break the God Realm,

291
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
do you think it is meaningless to me?

292
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
So many sacrifices

293
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
are sent here.

294
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Don't you want to know why?

295
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
If you don't come to the God Realm,

296
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
how can you make everything

297
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
that is for the Moon and the sea?

298
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Okay.

299
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Then tell me.

300
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Why does the Moon and the sea exist?

301
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,580
What is the so-called God Realm and the God Realm?

302
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
60,000 years ago,

303
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,580
the so-called God Realm was not in the land

304
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
but in the sky.

305
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,580
In the sky?

306
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
To be precise,

307
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
it is in the vast sky

308
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,580
that is the heart of the sea.

309
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
In the world,

310
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
there were three gods

311
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
in the world,

312
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
called the Night and the Demon.

313
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,580
They were the three tribes.

314
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
The Yin Clan was killed by the cruel and cruel.

315
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
The Demon Clan was in a terrible state.

316
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Only the Night Clan

317
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,580
could protect the gods and protect the Cangsheng.

318
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Over the years,

319
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
the Demon and the Demon were in a difficult situation.

320
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
They fought for their lives.

321
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
They were the only gods in the world.

322
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
The Night Clan had the strongest magic power

323
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
in the gods.

324
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
The Star Moon and the God Realm.

325
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
The God Realm is the place

326
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
that will protect the Demon and the Demon

327
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
and protect the Cangsheng.

328
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
Over the years,

329
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
the two tribes were used to

330
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
destroy the Star Moon and the God Realm.

331
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
The Star Realm is protected by the one.

332
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
The Cangsheng is not a difficult place.

333
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
That person

334
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
is the Star Moon and the God Realm.

335
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Star Moon?

336
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
That's right.

337
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
The Star Moon and the God Realm.

338
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,580
The strongest power in the Night Clan

339
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,580
is the one that makes people want to be the gods.

340
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
The five-division power of the God Realm

341
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,580
that he controls and controls

342
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
is only the one

343
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,580
who wants to be the Star Moon and the God Realm.

344
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Since he is the strongest,

345
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
he has the help of the Star Moon and the God Realm.

346
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Why is he still in the dark?

347
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
How could the gods come back to life?

348
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
Everything

349
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,580
has to be taken from a encounter.

350
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
Who is encountering?

351
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,580
The Star Moon and the God Realm.

352
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
Master.

353
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Master.

354
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Master.

355
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
Master.

356
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Master.

357
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
Master.

358
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
The Five-division Power of the Sky Realm is over.

359
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,580
The two elders have decided to

360
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,580
choose the three strongest, young Gods.

361
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Please be on your toes.

362
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
The Five-division Power of the Sky Realm

363
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
is one in ten thousand,

364
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,700
Why did you choose the Divine Order after I asked?

365
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,540
Xingyue Palace is a heavenly temple.

366
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,100
The Divine Order is the least of the Han State.

367
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,300
The Divine Order saved the Heavenly Order in the battlefield.

368
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,580
The Heavenly Order is willing to die and follow the Divine Order.

369
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,340
What about you?

370
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,620
Why did you choose the Divine Order?

371
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,900
The Divine Order is the most sacred temple in the world.

372
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,580
I am willing to follow it.

373
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,580
From now on, you are my Divine Order.

374
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,500
I am willing to follow it.

375
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,660
I am willing to follow it.

376
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,180
Thank you, God.

377
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,020
From now on, you are my God,

378
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
and I am your Yan.

379
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,700
I am willing to follow it.

380
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,020
The Divine Order

381
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,900
It's you.

382
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
And who is a Angry Team就會��?

383
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,400
誰相信詩一竟存 Now Irol視詩一竟存

384
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,900
更其是可另一方

385
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
大方詩一竟存

386
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,480
持震機

387
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,800
岑神君喜 κα 雕竭

388
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,760
不者應非价 度道冒犯

389
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,700
更不得望言

390
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
What?

391
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
It's a lie.

392
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
What lie?

393
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Today's thing is a lie.

394
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Okay, okay, okay.

395
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
It's not a lie.

396
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
You're A Yuan, right?

397
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
It's the content.

398
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
The duty of the new moon is to guard the new moon.

399
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
But it's not up to you.

400
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Don't bother me.

401
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
What does the god like?

402
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,700
The god doesn't like to disturb him.

403
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Go, go, go.

404
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
What are you doing?

405
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Didn't you say the god likes to be quiet?

406
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll just forget it here.

407
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
What's the best thing about you?

408
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Go, go, go.

409
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Go, go, go.

410
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
God.

411
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
God.

412
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I think the new moon is too cold.

413
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Is it pretty?

414
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
I thought the god doesn't like flowers.

415
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Then tell me what you like.

416
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I'll find whatever you want.

417
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
God.

418
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Even though the god is the master of the night,

419
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
he's a woman.

420
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
You can't change the way you dress.

421
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
You don't have to thank him.

422
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
God.

423
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
God, don't worry.

424
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I won't let him bother you.

425
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
You can find him.

426
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
What are you doing?

427
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
You better be quiet.

428
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Okay, okay.

429
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
I won't disturb him.

430
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
I told you.

431
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
The god has to be careful.

432
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I know.

433
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
You know?

434
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
The god doesn't like to dress.

435
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
He likes to dress.

436
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Do you like the flower?

437
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I've been picking for a long time.

438
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Didn't you say you won't disturb the god?

439
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
I said I won't disturb him.

440
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
I didn't say I'll kiss him.

441
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
You...

442
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Stop.

443
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Why?

444
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,700
God, listen to a prayer this winter.

445
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
funk at the Fragrance Faction.

446
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Why don't...

447
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,360
With my lord OFнос knowing what I would things.

448
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,760
哀

449
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,740
哀

450
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:20,020
要行

451
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,300
等随今

452
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,660
别作为我わ 킀

453
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
What does that mean?

454
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
What does he like?

455
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Wine.

456
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
I see.

457
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Where are you going?

458
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
God,

459
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,740
that bastard passed somewhere.

460
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,940
She didn't see us any phone calls anyway.

461
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,340
He won't come back.

462
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,540
Not?

463
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,580
He is your정을well.

464
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Why did he leave after losing the battle?

465
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,220
Do you have any rules, too?

466
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,420
Has he been hit by too many things lately?

467
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,340
A bunch ofimmer couldn't be ever seen.

468
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,480
It's not easy to get through a war

469
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
with full of ch Coachessry.

470
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,480
The gods are still as noble and clear as ever.

471
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
They don't seem to have any differences.

472
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,480
But it seems that there are some differences.

473
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,480
The gods, the elders are waiting.

474
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Please go and discuss with the gods.

475
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
God.

476
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I've been trying to change the gods' will for you.

477
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Do you want to try it?

478
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Why haven't you seen God for a long time?

479
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,480
What I like doesn't mean that I have to do it every day.

480
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
What I like doesn't mean that I have to get it every day.

481
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Have the gods been living in such a boring life?

482
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Boring?

483
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
What's boring?

484
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
There are many things that are boring.

485
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I wonder if the gods have any ideas.

486
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
For example?

487
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,480
For example, the jade seal is a thousand miles away.

488
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
It's a great reward.

489
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
God.

490
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,480
This is the most mysterious jade seal in our family.

491
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
God.

492
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I know the place where I practice.

493
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
So God saw the jade seal for 30,000 years.

494
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you see any differences today?

495
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Yes.

496
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
What's the difference?

497
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Of course, it's different than the jade seal.

498
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
God.

499
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,480
The stars are all over the sky.

500
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Only the most sacred place in the Star God of my family

501
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
can I hold the demon god.

502
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,480
How did God decide that I would bring you here?

503
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,480
The more difficult it is to do, the more you have to do it.

504
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I told you that I don't like the star god.

505
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm afraid that no matter what, you will bring me here to see this.

506
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
I have become a demon god.

507
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
When did God make me the god?

508
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
That night, when I invited you to the moon,

509
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
you showed your anger.

510
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,480
The star god is in the jade god's jade seal.

511
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I can't hide any anger from the jade god.

512
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
I know who you are in your first sight.

513
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Then why did you take me as the god?

514
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Aren't you afraid that I will really get the jade seal and find the star god?

515
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
If the demon god wants to do something in the jade god,

516
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
no one can be in my army.

517
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Since I came here for the star god,

518
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,480
I have to stay by my side.

519
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I thought I was a social person.

520
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,480
I didn't expect that you would be in the jade god's jade seal.

521
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
That's right.

522
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I came here to destroy the star god.

523
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Now you are trapped in this place.

524
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
You want to kill me?

525
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I can trap you to the star god.

526
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
If I am born to kill the star god,

527
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm afraid that the jade god will have to destroy it.

528
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
I have a promise to fulfill.

529
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I will not let you do anything.

530
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I can only temporarily destroy the demon god and stay here.

531
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I know what the god is going to do.

532
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
You and the jade god have promised to fight for a thousand years.

533
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Today is the day of the fight.

534
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
What is the matter?

535
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I just want to remind you.

536
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
The jade god has been in the jade god's jade seal for three years.

537
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
He is practicing a secret skill.

538
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,480
The jade god always comes to threaten.

539
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
The god is going to be careful.

540
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
The demon god will not wake up.

541
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
The jade god is coming.

542
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
The jade god is coming.

543
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
The jade god is coming.

544
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
The jade god is coming.

545
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
The jade god is coming.

546
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
The jade god is coming.

547
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
The jade god is coming.

548
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
The jade god is coming.

549
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
The jade god is coming.

550
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
The jade god is coming.

551
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
The jade god is coming.

552
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
The jade god is coming.

553
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
The jade god is coming.

554
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
The jade god is coming.

555
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
The jade god.

556
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Xing Yue,

557
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
I haven't seen you for a thousand years.

558
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
You still are so beautiful.

559
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
I've made a promise over a thousand years.

560
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Let's start fighting.

561
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,480
You are so strong that you don't need to make the right fight with me.

562
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,680
Marry me?

563
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,520
As the Goddess of my Shadow Clan,

564
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,080
we will destroy the Demon Clan and share the God's will.

565
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Isn't that good?

566
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Mo Li,

567
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
we made a promise to each other that year.

568
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,120
We will fight for a thousand years.

569
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,720
We will not let the defeated fight the God's will.

570
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,920
We will fight for a thousand years.

571
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,720
There is nothing more to say.

572
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Then let me see

573
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,320
how strong you are.

574
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,920
They will find their home among the €150 a month

575
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,940
really Xing Yue?

576
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,000
I have очень littleums.

577
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,120
Mo Li...

578
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,600
You have lost.

579
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,720
Do you remember what you did?

580
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,720
You will be my master sooner or later.

581
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Master?

582
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Why does he look exactly like Chongzhao?

583
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,720
What is Chongzhao and Master?

584
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,720
You already guessed it, right?

585
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
The three children Zhenyu is looking for

586
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
are the two gods of the Heart Moon and the Golden Plains.

587
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,720
And one is the god of Shadow Lord, Chongzhao.

588
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
But Chongzhao is the Fairy Tribe.

589
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
He is kind and righteous.

590
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
How could he be related to the Shadow Lord?

591
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,720
There are many things that are certain in the world.

592
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Just like you have to go through all kinds of things to get here.

593
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Just like you have to understand everything that happened six hundred thousand years ago

594
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
to break the world.

595
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,720
To be honest, you are so stupid that you can't even think of anything.

596
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
I will tell you everything.

597
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Be patient.

598
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Okay.

599
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Then I will finish this story for you.

600
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
He is injured.

601
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Since the Heart Moon God is so powerful,

602
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
why does the Heart Moon be injured?

603
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,720
The Heart Moon God is the gift of the Heavenly Emperor, the Star God.

604
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Only the Heart Moon Goddess can make it disappear in the night.

605
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
But to make the strongest God in the world disappear,

606
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
it also needs to pay the same price.

607
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Even if it is the God.

608
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
What price?

609
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
The Fang Qin Nian Yu Wang.

610
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
The thousand petals of God.

611
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Fang Nian Yu.

612
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
The Heart Moon God.

613
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
You mean...

614
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,720
The God is not born without love.

615
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,720
It is for the God Yu and for the Cang Sheng.

616
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,720
To seal all of their love and desire in the Five-Year Stone.

617
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
It is also because of this,

618
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,720
that the Five-Year Stone will have a strong God.

619
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
But after the God Yu was destroyed,

620
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
the God Yu was lost,

621
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
was it because of the Heart Moon God

622
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
that he was in love?

623
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Yin Li?

624
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I have warned you not to be too impudent.

625
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
He has hidden the God's power here?

626
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Today, he and Mo Li have a battle.

627
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
They must be two defeated.

628
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
As long as the Heart Moon God is destroyed,

629
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
the demons will immediately send two troops.

630
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
From now on,

631
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
the God Yu must be my demon clan.

632
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I, the Chief Star God, am not in love with the Moon God.

633
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I will do it.

634
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
I will do it.

635
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Star Moon, even if I want to be the God Yu,

636
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,720
I will fight you with all my might.

637
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
I will do it.

638
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,720
This Yin Li is actually unable to be removed.

639
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,720
It seems that I can only use my power to suppress you.

640
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,720
It will always be cold and cold.

641
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Only at this moment,

642
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,720
will it not be like the Night Clan's body.

643
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Star Moon,

644
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
I am really curious

645
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,720
if you will be so heartless.

646
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,720
The answer is already in the air.

647
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,720
This life is in vain.

648
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
God Jun, something happened!

649
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
The Five-Nine Deity has changed!

650
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Who?

651
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Shut up.

652
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
You...

653
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
You...

654
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Get out.

655
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
No!

656
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Why are you wearing the demon clan's clothes?

657
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Demon clan? You are the demon clan!

658
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Leave.

659
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
What does he want?

660
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Is he going to kill me?

661
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Stay here. I will go back.

662
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Where is he going?

663
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
God Yu, Snow, and the Snow.

664
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
He is going to marry Yuhua.

665
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
What?

666
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,720
The Nine-Spirit Talisman is the essence of the Soul-Dragging Bead.

667
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
The essence of the Soul-Dragging Bead?

668
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,720
The Nine-Spirit Talisman is an infinite life.

669
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
It is a good healing flower.

670
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
That is why,

671
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,720
the Soul-Dragging Bead can be preserved in the God's War.

672
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
So, the Soul-Dragging Bead said that

673
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
it has been with Jin Yuan for 100 years.

674
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
Is that true?

675
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,720
What is the real essence of the Soul-Dragging Bead?

676
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
God Yu, be careful. He is a demon.

677
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
Don't say a word.

678
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
God...

679
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Demon god Jin Yuan?

680
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Demon god, you are making me crazy.

681
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
God Yu.

682
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
It's nothing. You can leave.

683
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Xiu Yan, remember.

684
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
There is only god Yu here.

685
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Yes, God Yu.

686
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I will go back to the temple.

687
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I will go back to the temple.

688
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I will go back to the temple.

689
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Yes, God Yu.

690
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I have no strength to escape.

691
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Even if he cultivates the magic,

692
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
you have the God of the Moon.

693
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Why do you still do that?

694
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Why didn't you go back to the Moon Palace last night?

695
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
God is so considerate.

696
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,720
I know it is not another kind of illusion.

697
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
This bead is good for your health.

698
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
It can help you to change your energy.

699
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,720
You just need to make a adjustment every day.

700
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,720
It will heal you in a few days.

701
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
The Nine-Spirit Bead.

702
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
It grows in the Holy Blood.

703
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
It is a red-haired snake.

704
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
It takes a lot of effort to make it.

705
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
What do you want to change?

706
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Change?

707
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,720
It seems that God doesn't know me.

708
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
If I really want it,

709
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,720
I don't need it.

710
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,720
I just need to take it.

711
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
The one standing in the distance.

712
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Don't be afraid.

713
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,720
The stars will guide you to the desert.

714
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Come on.

715
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Come on.

716
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:52,720
My heart is so excited.

717
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Wait for me.

718
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,720
The stars will guide you to the desert.

719
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,720
You are the light I want to see.

720
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,720
You are the only way.

721
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Let this moment be with you.

722
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,720
Let this moment be with you.

723
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,720
The stars will guide you to the desert.

724
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,720
You are the only way.

725
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Let this moment be with you.

726
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,720
Let this moment be with you.

727
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Let this moment be with you.

728
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,720
I love you.
