1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Something really specialbie

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,020
A stranded bird

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,900
Posters

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,260
After before

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:41,860
May I like the stars

6
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:49,220
And the world

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:56,220
I only want to watch every day of my life with the one I love.

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,220
I want to be with you forever.

9
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
The first demon is the land.

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,220
You and him are not the same person.

11
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
You are the one.

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,220
You are the one.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,220
You are the one.

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,220
You are the one.

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,220
You are not the same person.

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,220
You have always been sincere to me.

17
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,220
I am the one.

18
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Life is clear.

19
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
Life is real.

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,220
We live together.

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
We die together.

22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,220
The first demon is the land.

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
You and him are not the same person.

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
You are the one.

25
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
You are the one.

26
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
You are the one.

27
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,220
You are the one.

28
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
You are the one.

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
You are the one.

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,220
You are the one.

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
You are the one.

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
You are the one.

33
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
You are the one.

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
You are the one.

35
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,220
You are the one.

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
You are the one.

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
You are the one.

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
You are the one.

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
You are the one.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,220
You are the one.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,220
You are the one.

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
You are the one.

43
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,220
You are the one.

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
You are the one.

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,220
You are the one.

46
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,220
You are the one.

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
You are the one.

48
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
You are the one.

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,220
episode 29

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
I have listened systems for long.

51
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
You could go Geschichte,

52
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
it, and see it.

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,220
If you need your friends to be with,

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,220
then you can help me with this.

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
It's time for the physician.

56
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Let's talk about it.

57
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
We've heard that

58
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,220
you are facialALLY an adult

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
with small inc 영상을 scales,

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,220
compare with x-ray scales to no worldwide dreams.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
That's rare.

62
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Although the equipment is?

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
It has two major characteristics.

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
One which leaves less of the same.

65
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Unfortunately,

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,920
Here, rub this noun.

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,320
That's cream.

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,000
Child.

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,340
You come to this, im posting unforgettable moments

70
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,900
with no bother

71
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
A'Chi

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
I thought I would never see you again.

73
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
You two are too good.

74
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
Where is your spell?

75
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
The owner of the shop opened it for me.

76
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,220
You didn't use the spell?

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
You can't hide these tricks from me.

78
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Did you really think of me?

79
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
The owner?

80
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
What's going on?

81
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
Why is my spiritual power so weak?

82
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,220
The owner of the shop is not weak.

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,220
You should temporarily use your spiritual power to rest here.

84
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
Chang Mei sent you to help me.

85
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
To deal with Bai Shuo.

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
I wanted to kill you.

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
But Bai Shuo asked me to do it.

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
You are innocent.

89
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Chang Wu, you are more than lucky.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Don't you want to know why Qi became a foodie?

91
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Don't you want to know what secrets he had between Chang Mei and you?

92
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,220
How do you know?

93
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I will go to the book of love and see if I understand.

94
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Go.

95
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,220
Master.

96
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
If you come with Chang Mei...

97
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Don't worry.

98
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
I have some things to do.

99
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
You take care of yourself first.

100
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
Mu Jiu...

101
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,220
He promised to be the owner of the shop to save you.

102
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
He is the first one to find out what happened to you today.

103
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
There are some things you should not miss.

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
If you miss it,

105
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
just like Qi and Wu,

106
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
Linglong and Rongxian,

107
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
are you right?

108
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
A box.

109
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,220
It only allows you to hold a box for a while.

110
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
Then you can stay away from it.

111
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,220
You are the one I want to be with.

112
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,220
I am the one who is drunk and I am drunk.

113
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Please wait for me.

114
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,220
I will stay with you for a while.

115
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
Fan Yue, you are...

116
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Shouldn't you be in the town of your tribe?

117
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Chang Mei,

118
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
you are not the only one who can do it.

119
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
I can also talk to you about the truth.

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
For example, the truth of Qi's death.

121
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Chang Wu and Chang Lao must be curious to know.

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
Master, I have promised you.

123
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
Now you can tell me

124
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
how Qi died.

125
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Where is Ruoshui Stone?

126
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,220
I am suspicious of you.

127
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
I am not suspicious.

128
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
I just want to ask for the truth.

129
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
But as Chang Wu and Chang Lao said,

130
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
since I can let Rongxian calm down,

131
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I can also let Qi put down his obsession.

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Rongxian's obsession is to destroy the hatred.

133
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
He killed his own son.

134
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
So he doesn't want to forgive himself.

135
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
What is Qi's obsession?

136
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,220
If he is willing to die for the sake of the tribe,

137
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
why won't he leave for a thousand years?

138
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,220
Unless he is killed by someone.

139
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
For example,

140
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Hu Yan of the tribe!

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
Master!

142
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Master,

143
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
don't hide from me until now.

144
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Did Miss Bai tell you the truth?

145
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
How did my brother die?

146
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
I was so jealous of Qi.

147
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
How could I harm him?

148
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
You won't.

149
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
But love is the truth.

150
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
You know how much you love Linglong.

151
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Qi is clear about it.

152
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,220
When you made the choice

153
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,220
to kill Ruoshui Stone

154
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
for the sake of the tribe,

155
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
it was not you who killed Qi.

156
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,220
It was his love for you.

157
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Linglong was dead, but he was still alive.

158
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
He could live a strange life.

159
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
How could you make up for him?

160
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
You are wrong.

161
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,220
I am wrong.

162
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
It's not me.

163
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
I am the only blood of Linglong.

164
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
It's only been two hundred years.

165
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
It's just a small amount.

166
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,220
If I didn't have the power of Ruoshui Stone,

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
he would have died.

168
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Then you can't let everyone die with him.

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
You are the master of the tribe.

170
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
But I am Linglong's sister first.

171
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Linglong used his power to make up for the wine.

172
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
I must protect him.

173
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
I don't want to care about

174
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,380
what kind of

175
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Jinyou Mountain or the tribe.

176
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
If Linglong can't be famous in the Jiuquan,

177
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I won't be able to face

178
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,220
the people who will only

179
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
pull him out of the valley

180
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
and curse him.

181
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Awu.

182
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
I only ask you one thing.

183
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Are you helping me

184
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
or the tribe?

185
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
I am helping you.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
Okay.

187
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Then you can keep Ruoshui Stone for me.

188
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
No one can know

189
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
that I put Ruoshui Stone

190
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
into Jiuquan's body.

191
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
How can you keep it?

192
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
In a few days,

193
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
the Qin Shuo will be completely dead.

194
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
At that time,

195
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
the whole tribe will know.

196
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
And you

197
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220
will be the sinner of the tribe.

198
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,220
I don't care.

199
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
I am not afraid.

200
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Jiuquan is my life.

201
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
I am still alive.

202
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
I am still alive.

203
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
My only hope is that

204
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
no matter who hurts him,

205
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
I won't let him go.

206
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Ruoshui Stone is lost.

207
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
The tribe won't let him go.

208
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Jiuquan is so great.

209
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Are you going to let him

210
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
hide his life in secret?

211
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Awu.

212
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Listen to me.

213
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
You can still find

214
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
the way to save Jiuquan.

215
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Give it back.

216
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
If you really want to

217
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
go to Qin Shuo and the tribe,

218
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,220
and the whole tribe,

219
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
you will regret it.

220
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
I understand.

221
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
In the end,

222
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
you still don't want to help me.

223
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
I am not.

224
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
I should have known

225
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
love is the most unbelievable thing

226
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
in this world.

227
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Linglong is stupid.

228
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
I am more stupid.

229
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
I shouldn't have wronged you.

230
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Awu.

231
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Don't be ridiculous.

232
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Jiuquan is a private love.

233
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
You are now the tribe leader.

234
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
You shouldn't have such a private love.

235
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Why did Linglong

236
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,220
make a mistake at that time?

237
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Fine.

238
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
You are just kind.

239
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
You are doing this for Jin Youshan.

240
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
I am selfish with Linglong.

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,220
I don't deserve to be the tribe leader.

242
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
You are the same as those people.

243
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Go away.

244
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Awu.

245
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
If you insist on Jiuquan's life,

246
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
then kill me.

247
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Awu.

248
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Don't be ridiculous.

249
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
Awu.

250
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Awu.

251
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
You knew I loved you.

252
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
How could I have killed you?

253
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
I might have killed you.

254
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
If you even suspect this love,

255
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
fine.

256
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
I will prove it to you.

257
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
I killed him.

258
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
If I didn't fight with him that day,

259
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,220
and didn't say those words to him,

260
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
I wouldn't have died.

261
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Love is the knife of killing.

262
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
It is the most hurtful thing in the world.

263
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
If I didn't fight with him that day,

264
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
he wouldn't have done such a thing.

265
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
Awu.

266
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Awu.

267
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Awu.

268
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
I regret it the most.

269
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
I can't see you wearing those fake clothes.

270
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Don't be silly.

271
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Xiaojiao is my only child.

272
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
I don't deserve to be the one.

273
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Since I was born,

274
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
I have been your guardian.

275
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
I have always been the only one.

276
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
That is your happiness.

277
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
I love you.

278
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
I have lived my life and everything.

279
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
I don't need to take Linglong Shao with me.

280
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
From now on,

281
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
you will never have a smile.

282
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
My heart

283
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
has already died with your heart.

284
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
No.

285
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
No.

286
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
One side is Xiaojiao,

287
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
the other side is Hu Zong.

288
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
I will beg for your help

289
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
whatever you want.

290
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
No matter what you do.

291
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Aqian.

292
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Aqian.

293
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Aqian.

294
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
No.

295
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,220
No.

296
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
No.

297
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Linglong Shao.

298
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
No.

299
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
No.

300
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
No.

301
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,220
I have lived my life and everything.

302
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,220
I have lived my life and everything.

303
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,220
I have lived my life and everything.

304
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Look at me.

305
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
So the one who is born

306
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
is dead for the master of the mountain.

307
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Why is he so far away?

308
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Why is he so young

309
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
and so young and so young?

310
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
That is a cruel fate.

311
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
It is not Aqian's wish.

312
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
It is A'wu's.

313
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
If I am not wrong,

314
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Aqian left A'wu's only guilt

315
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
after he died.

316
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
You have killed Aqian

317
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,220
with all your heart.

318
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
You think he hates you.

319
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
He should not leave this place.

320
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
With this guilt,

321
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
you come to Aqian

322
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
and tell him your thoughts.

323
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
Your heart is shaped into a wish.

324
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
This wish is not in the love book.

325
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
It will be a book of people

326
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
after it is born.

327
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
I didn't expect that

328
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
it is the wish of the guilty person

329
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
in Changmei's heart.

330
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
If he is not guilty,

331
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
maybe this book will not be eaten.

332
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Young lady.

333
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
It stinks.

334
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Come to me.

335
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Is it fun?

336
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
This suit looks good.

337
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I think this skirt is also good.

338
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
Yes, it looks good.

339
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
Hurry up.

340
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Hurry up.

341
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
It is so beautiful.

342
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
You look ugly.

343
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
You look ugly.

344
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Young lady.

345
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Young lady, what's wrong?

346
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Young lady, are you okay?

347
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
It's okay.

348
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I just

349
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I just saw something.

350
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
What did you see?

351
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
It's too fast.

352
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
I didn't see clearly.

353
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
I told you to stay in Lengquan Palace.

354
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Why are you here?

355
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Young lady left me alone in Lengquan Palace.

356
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Chenye's guy always bullied me.

357
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I was worried that Young lady

358
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
would run out of the palace secretly.

359
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,220
Keep the bug.

360
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
There will be danger in the bug trap.

361
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
Let's hurry up.

362
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Young lady.

363
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
Why do you care about the bug trap?

364
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
He said it with his heart.

365
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
He didn't know that you came to help him.

366
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
What business did you do with the princess?

367
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
Stop it.

368
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
I have never lived my life

369
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,220
according to my own heart.

370
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Since I chose it,

371
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
I don't regret it.

372
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
Lady,

373
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
I have been a maid.

374
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
You didn't choose it at all.

375
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
I have never blamed Awu.

376
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
I died

377
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
to make you live better.

378
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
What he wants to do is to fulfill his promise.

379
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
If you let this promise

380
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
become a prison for you,

381
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
you will really be sorry for him.

382
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Just because you are so kind to him,

383
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
you can know

384
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
what he thinks

385
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
by talking to him.

386
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
The love that Ah Qi has for him

387
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
has been wrong to me.

388
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,220
He must hate me.

389
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
He hates me.

390
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
I have never met Ah Qi.

391
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
But I know

392
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
every one of you

393
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,220
who loves each other

394
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
will not hate you

395
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
because of your life.

396
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Love shouldn't be torture.

397
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
It's the old saying.

398
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,220
It's the right thing to do.

399
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Lady,

400
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Miss Bai is right.

401
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
I am doing this for you

402
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
just like you did for Mujiu.

403
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Today,

404
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I am hiding the secret

405
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,220
of the young master's death.

406
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Don't you want to

407
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
use your own death

408
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
to heal your love?

409
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
It's been a thousand years.

410
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
I have been tired.

411
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
When Ling Long was alive,

412
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
I was fine.

413
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
But when he died,

414
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
everything in the mountain changed.

415
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
I still remember

416
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
when I held the wine

417
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
for the first time

418
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
in my life.

419
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
I only wanted to protect him.

420
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
I gave him

421
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
everything that should belong to Ling Long.

422
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
So you want Mujiu

423
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
to be the master

424
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
on Ling Long's birthday

425
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
on the day of the ceremony?

426
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
Yes.

427
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
These are all the wine

428
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
that Hu Zu owed Ling Long.

429
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Hu Zu should return it to Mujiu.

430
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
But I...

431
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
I protected Xiaojiu

432
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
but I was wrong to Ah Qi.

433
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
He didn't want me

434
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
to be the master.

435
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
I shouldn't have been alive.

436
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
But what he wanted

437
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
was to make you alive.

438
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
No,

439
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Ah Cao.

440
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Young master is still young.

441
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
He can't be a heavy person.

442
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
If you die like this,

443
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
have you ever thought

444
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
what he should do?

445
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
All these years of tragedy

446
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
should have ended long ago.

447
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Miss Bai once said

448
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
that death is not scary.

449
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
The scary thing is that

450
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
the last person

451
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
in this world

452
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
will also leave.

453
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
I didn't understand anything before.

454
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Now I don't have the courage

455
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
to spend more time with him.

456
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
I don't want to

457
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
have any more problems.

458
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
Please forgive us

459
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
for our mistakes.

460
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Master Chang Wu, no!

461
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Xiao Bai!

462
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
Xiao Bai,

463
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Xiao Bai,

464
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Xiao Bai,

465
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Xiao Bai has been crying

466
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
for so many years

467
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
and now he is hiding

468
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
the secret of Mu Jiushan

469
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
with his own death.

470
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Love

471
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
is it to make people happy

472
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
or to let people

473
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
get into the silence?

474
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
The two generations of the Hu family

475
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
have such a love.

476
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,220
In the morning,

477
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
in the capital,

478
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
the heart is like a piece of paper

479
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,220
and it's hard to hold it.

480
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
You know,

481
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
if we didn't have

482
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
a love in the past,

483
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
we wouldn't have

484
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,220
a love in the future.

485
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
We would have

486
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
a love in the future.

487
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
We would have a love in the future.

488
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
We would have a love in the future.

489
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
We would have a love in the future.

490
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
If we didn't

491
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
change our destiny in the dream,

492
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
wouldn't these tragedies

493
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
happen?

494
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
If not,

495
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
there won't be

496
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Mu Jiushan in this world.

497
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
The cultivation of the Hu family

498
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
is a battle between the two worlds.

499
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Even if there is only one way out,

500
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
we should try to walk this path.

501
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Now, the love is over.

502
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
But the words

503
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,220
that Master Wu said

504
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,220
didn't happen.

505
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm only worried that

506
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,220
there will be a change tonight.

507
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
It's nothing to worry about.

508
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
No matter what happens,

509
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
I'm here.

510
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Didn't you say that?

511
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
Every true love

512
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
is willing to use

513
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
the life to protect it.

514
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
It won't be

515
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,220
because of sacrifice.

516
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
It shouldn't be a torture.

517
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
It's the saving of each other.

518
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,220
It's a promise.

519
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
What do you mean?

520
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
What do you mean?

521
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
I'm pretending to be silly.

522
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Some things

523
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,220
are too clever.

524
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
I'm afraid I'm too self-centered.

525
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Shuang,

526
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
I...

527
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
I didn't want to hurt you.

528
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Let him go.

529
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
I just want to take you away.

530
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
Fan Yue is just using you.

531
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
You're the only one

532
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
who can put you in danger.

533
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Now, you're the one

534
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
who makes me put myself in danger.

535
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Isn't that you?

536
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
You've already

537
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
mixed up with the people

538
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
in the Cold Palace.

539
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
You might even

540
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220
be the one in the Cold Palace.

541
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
I wouldn't believe you

542
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
but I'm sure

543
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
you're right.

544
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
You're the one who

545
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
mixed up with the enemies

546
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
who killed my father.

547
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
Why did you say that?

548
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
It's for my own good.

549
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,220
Shuang,

550
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
I don't want to ask

551
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
many things.

552
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
I want to keep

553
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
the friendship between you and me.

554
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
I've been waiting for you

555
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
to explain to me

556
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
but you didn't say anything.

557
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
You lied to me once,

558
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
twice.

559
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
It wasn't your fault.

560
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
But if I had trusted you

561
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
for the third time,

562
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
it would be my fault.

563
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Don't come looking for me again.

564
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,220
Let's go.

565
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Shuang,

566
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
listen to me.

567
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Fan Yu,

568
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
I can always win you one day.

569
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
I want to deal with

570
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Fan Yu and Chang Mei

571
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
and two demons at the same time.

572
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
I can only use

573
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
the Qin Shu of Jing You Mountain

574
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
to pick up the people

575
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
who are important to the Hu tribe

576
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
and their opponents.

577
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
The demon I gave you

578
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
just now

579
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
is on the battlefield.

580
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
I can't let Qin Shu

581
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
cry again.

582
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Du video

583
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
There's no escape

584
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
for tonight.

585
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,260
Jing You Mountain

586
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,220
can only give Hao Yue

587
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
weapons.

588
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
If it continues,

589
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
there will be lots of casualties.

590
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
What if it's me who puts the fury

591
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
No.

592
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
Zhang Lang!

593
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,220
Yangquan Palace's Fulin?

594
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Zhang Lang, it's him!

595
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
He hurt our people!

596
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
He's a monster.

597
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
We're both in the same boat.

598
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
It's a monster.

599
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Monster?

600
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Zhang Lang!

601
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Zhang Lang!

602
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
Zhang Lang!

603
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,220
He's dead, but no one's hiding the secret for Chang Wei.

604
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
You're looking for death?

605
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Fulin, what do you want to do in the Cold Spring Palace?

606
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,220
I'm killing someone for you.

607
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
If you get into the hands of your Chang Wei,

608
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
it won't be that easy.

609
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Why don't you go and take a look at that tree?

610
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Look at your Chang Wei,

611
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,220
what good things have you done to the people in their hauyue hall?

612
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Nonsense!

613
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
You're a traitor!

614
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Chang Mei, what's wrong with the Qing Shui?

615
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Chang Sheng is dead, and Chang Wu is dead.

616
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,220
What have you done to the Qing Shui in the hauyue hall?

617
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,220
The Qing Shui has nothing to do with the hauyue hall.

618
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
It has nothing to do with anyone.

619
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
It's because I'm not good at protecting the Jin You Mountain.

620
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
I'm not afraid of dying.

621
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,220
If I were to die, I would have told you a thousand years ago.

622
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,220
You people have been cultivating for so many years,

623
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,220
and you have no one to be proud of.

624
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Today, the foreigners are here to find me a way to speak.

625
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,220
It's like you care about the Hu tribe.

626
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Every time something bad happens,

627
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I'm not the one who needs to be solved.

628
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,220
It was like this when Ling Long was a Saintess.

629
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Now it's like this.

630
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm afraid it'll still be like this.

631
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
That's right, Xiao Ba.

632
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,220
A thousand years.

633
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
We've lived too long.

634
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,220
From the beginning to the end, we've been carrying Ling Long's body.

635
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
I'm the only one.

636
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,220
You hate him and never hate him.

637
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,220
You just want a sinner who can be punished by heaven.

638
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,220
Now, it's my turn.

639
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
A'Qing.

640
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Please wait for me under the tree.

641
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
What?

642
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
The Hu tribe is on the other side.

643
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
The Demon Sect has already ordered the Qin tree.

644
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Isn't Elder Chang Wu just sacrificed himself

645
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
to restore the tree?

646
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Why is he crying so soon?

647
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
I followed that Fulin yesterday and entered the forest.

648
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
But he ran away again.

649
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
I saw Qin Shu nearby and practiced the charging skill.

650
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
He must have done it.

651
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,220
The goal of the Cold Spring Palace is to protect the people.

652
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
I'm the goal of the Cold Spring Palace.

653
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,220
It seems that I've dragged the mountain out.

654
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I'm so worried.

655
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Elder Chang Wu has already lost his life.

656
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
Now, he's going to restore the tree

657
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
to prevent things from getting worse.

658
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,220
He'll be buried in the water and the wood.

659
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
You don't have to blame yourself.

660
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
It has nothing to do with you.

661
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,220
The water and the wood?

662
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,220
The most urgent thing is not my business.

663
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Since the first night we entered the Mount Jin,

664
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
the five-year-old has shown that

665
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Qin Shu is related to the picture.

666
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Do you think that the jade warrior

667
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
can only get a year

668
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
after we help the Hu tribe solve the problem of Qin Shu?

669
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
When is this the time?

670
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
You're still thinking about this for a few years.

671
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Don't you want to die?

672
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
I want your life.

673
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,220
I'll find another way to solve the Seven Stars Fire Soul.

674
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
If there's another way,

675
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
you'll have to suffer for so many years.

676
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
I have my own plan.

677
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Then you'll have to swallow me.

678
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I can't bear this.

679
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
Can you just listen to me?

680
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Don't be so stubborn.

681
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
This jade is still old.

682
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,220
But the color is bright and bright.

683
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
I'm sorry.

684
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I think it's your aunt's love.

685
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
You'd better return it to her.

686
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Aunt, I'm sorry for what happened to you.

687
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,220
I'm sorry for what I said to her.

688
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
No need.

689
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Although I've been here for a long time,

690
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,220
I can still see her concern for you.

691
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,220
I'm also a mother.

692
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
If possible,

693
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
I also hope that someone like her

694
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
will protect me like you.

695
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,220
I think that whatever she does,

696
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
it's all for you.

697
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,220
Aunt, she really has a good time with me.

698
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
She wants me to be the one who can protect Zhou Quan.

699
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Unfortunately,

700
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
I can only let her down this time.

701
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
By the way, A'Huo,

702
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
when I find the food for you,

703
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
I'll leave with you here.

704
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Okay?

705
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Really?

706
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,220
The master wants to be buried?

707
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
Of course it's true.

708
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
The old man in the room

709
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,220
was saying that it was eaten by the Qin tree.

710
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,220
He also said that the master was the one behind it.

711
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
He wanted her to die.

712
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Master?

713
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
What should we do?

714
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Aunt!

715
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
They said they want to be buried.

716
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
What do you mean?

717
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
You came just in time.

718
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Give me your clothes.

719
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
I haven't told you

720
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
many things.

721
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
And I should tell you today.

722
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,220
I'm sorry.

723
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Come.

724
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Master, I don't understand.

725
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
If the water is in the tombstone,

726
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
the old man will just take it out.

727
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
If it's really that simple,

728
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
why do you need to die?

729
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,220
She said that the tombstone

730
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
was buried for 200,000 years.

731
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
It was just a small baby.

732
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,220
If it wasn't for the water,

733
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
it would have been dead long ago.

734
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
But the tombstone is weak.

735
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,220
It needs to absorb the water slowly.

736
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
So, Chang Mei

737
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
sealed it for more than 700 years.

738
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Until 20 years ago,

739
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
the water was completely dissolved

740
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
in the tombstone.

741
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Now, the doctor is dead.

742
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Now, she's dead.

743
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
What if she dies?

744
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
What should we do?

745
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
But...

746
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
What if she doesn't take it out?

747
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
What if the white tree dies?

748
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
What should the owner do?

749
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,220
So, I'm Ling Long's child.

750
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
Rong Xian is my father.

751
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
I've seen them in the city.

752
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
I've seen them in the city, auntie.

753
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I should have told you

754
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
all these years.

755
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
But the secret of the tombstone

756
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
can't be known by anyone.

757
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
When I got the moon,

758
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
I was afraid that

759
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
the sky would be weak

760
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
when I came here.

761
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Xiao Jiu, everything that auntie did

762
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
was just to protect you.

763
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
The tree can't cry.

764
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
I can't die either.

765
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
So, you've been hiding it

766
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
for so many years.

767
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,220
Even now, you're going to give up.

768
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
You're hiding my secret.

769
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
Silly boy.

770
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
I'm just tired.

771
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
People should have

772
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,220
a reason to live.

773
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
I've been thinking about

774
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
the problem

775
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,220
that Ling Long had just left.

776
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,220
Rong Xian

777
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
passed on to her body

778
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
and said that she had the power

779
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
to protect your life.

780
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Why didn't she live on her own?

781
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
She left me

782
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
the hope of living.

783
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Not only that,

784
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,220
I only knew

785
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
that the tower at that time

786
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
was dead.

787
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,220
I was afraid that

788
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
the tower after that

789
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
would be dead.

790
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
My heart was dead.

791
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
Why did I keep my life?

792
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
After Qi died,

793
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
my heart was dead too.

794
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
But I dare not die.

795
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
What if I die?

796
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
I only hope that you can grow up quickly.

797
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
I hope that you can practice magic

798
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
and protect yourself.

799
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
I hope that you're a sensible person.

800
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
I hope that you're strong.

801
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
I hope that you can protect yourself

802
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
after I die.

803
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,220
If I'm wrong,

804
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
I should have listened to you

805
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
and practiced magic.

806
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
I wouldn't have died today.

807
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
No.

808
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
I was wrong.

809
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
I just wanted to make you stronger,

810
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
but I forgot to make you happy.

811
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
If Miss Bai hadn't reminded me,

812
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
I would have forgotten.

813
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Before Ling Long died,

814
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,220
she obviously didn't want me to go back to You Shan.

815
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
She wanted me to live my life

816
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
but I couldn't take you with me.

817
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
It doesn't matter, aunt.

818
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
It doesn't matter.

819
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
When I was young,

820
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,220
I was mocked by others.

821
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
I didn't have a father or a mother.

822
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
I always followed you.

823
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Who was my parents?

824
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
Aunt told me that

825
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
who didn't matter to me.

826
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
Who I am.

827
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
I always remember that.

828
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,220
I was always controlled by you.

829
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
So I wanted freedom.

830
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
I didn't have a father or a mother.

831
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
So I wanted a family.

832
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
But now,

833
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
I have everything.

834
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I've already lived the life I wanted.

835
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
I've lived for Ling Long.

836
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
I've saved Fan Yue.

837
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
But what raised me was my aunt.

838
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
I'm not filial.

839
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,220
I'm just a fool.

840
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
I'm not worthy of being a mother.

841
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Who was my father?

842
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
I've been like this for years.

843
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,220
She deservedには을.

844
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
I have no other way.

845
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,220
There he is.

846
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Hello,�!

847
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,540
Mantian, you're coming back

848
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,880
Chief, she will be your wife

849
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,100
what are you gonna do?

850
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,720
go to Matrix developers

851
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,780
and offer a take on her

852
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,940
where do you come from yourself?

853
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,640
Matrix developers will ascertain

854
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,800
this modern underground palace

855
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,100
but we have enough people

856
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,280
why on your own coming to the city of Ning-an?

857
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Don't you think this Ning'an city is very interesting?

858
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,280
A small town, with a god,

859
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
has been taken to the capital.

860
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
And the people who can enter the city,

861
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,280
and the Demon King himself,

862
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,280
have already heard about the Banquets of the Bujilou.

863
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,280
And after the cold, they naturally came to see it.

864
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
After all, it's very soon.

865
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,280
The new battle is about to begin.

866
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
City Leader! City Leader!

867
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Greetings, City Leader.

868
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
How's your business?

869
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Business is good.

870
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
The capital is in chaos.

871
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Bai Xun is dead.

872
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
It's so soon, there's a new city leader.

873
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Look.

874
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
In a few years, who still remembers who Bai Xun is?

875
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,280
There's never been any long-term experience in this world.

876
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
If you want to save someone's life,

877
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,280
you have to risk your life.

878
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
If you take the new city leader's life,

879
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
and complete the chain of evil,

880
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
you'll die in the end.

881
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
City Leader, there's a gun.

882
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
It's poison.

883
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
It's a clue.

884
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Yes.

885
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
City Leader,

886
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,280
I think it's your first time to make a fire in the city.

887
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
It's you.

888
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
The demon clan of Lengquan Palace.

889
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,280
The Immortal of the Forest is not well in the sect.

890
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Why did you come to this small city?

891
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
If you didn't come,

892
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
you wouldn't have been in the human clan.

893
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Speak.

894
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Did you do the three cities in the West's list?

895
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
You can do it so easily.

896
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Except me,

897
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
there's still something.

898
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
You're crazy!

899
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I'll punish you today.

900
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
You've done a great job.

901
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
You're so good.

902
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
You're so good.

903
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
You've done a great job.

904
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
You're so good.

905
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
This cup is for the unmarried for many years.

906
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I've never been able to drink it.

907
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,280
This cup is for the young and beautiful.

908
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
You've blocked the wind and rain for me

909
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
because of the many troubles.

910
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
This cup is for you.

911
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I've been waiting for this world for 20 years.

912
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
I should have a drink.

913
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
I should have A'Wu.

914
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I've been drinking this all my life.

915
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
A'Wu is dead.

916
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I shouldn't be so helpless.

917
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I shouldn't be the one who should take the blame.

918
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,280
I shouldn't be the one who should take the blame.

919
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm sorry.

920
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Silly girl.

921
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Go.

922
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I should have let you go.

923
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Then you're the only one who should die here.

924
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
And I'm the same as you.

925
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,280
You're living in the kuijiu of the dead.

926
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I don't want to.

927
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I've lost my mother.

928
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,280
I won't let you die this time.

929
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Xiaoxiao.

930
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
This tea...

931
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I'm sorry, aunt.

932
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
I was scared to death.

933
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
I shouldn't have used your trust in me.

934
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
But I want to protect you.

935
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Even if it's just one time.

936
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
No.

937
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Don't.

938
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Don't.

939
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Let me be the one who should protect you.

940
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,280
