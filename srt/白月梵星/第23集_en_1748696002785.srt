The world is here, and we are here.

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,320
What is the flower that never ended?

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,320
What is the flower that never ended?

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,320
What is the flower that never ended?

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
What is the flower that never ended?

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,320
What is the flower that never ended?

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I only want to watch every sunset with the one I love.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I want to be with you forever.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,320
I am the one you love.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
The fairy demon is a loser.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,320
You and her are not the same person.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
The fairy demon is a loser.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
You and her are not the same person.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I only want to watch every sunset with the one I love.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
What is the flower that never ended?

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,320
What is the flower that never ended?

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,320
What is the flower that never ended?

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
The dawn will shine upon you in the night,

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,680

32
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
Is Ayut there?

33
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,660
I should not have told her about some of the past.

34
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,660
A Yue is calm.

35
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,660
She didn't have many friends when she was in Bai Ze.

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,660
Now she can become a friend with you.

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,660
I'm happy for her.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,660
Please help her to solve it.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Actually, it's not her fault.

40
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,660
The past of Bai Ze is the biggest pain and regret in Taixing.

41
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,660
She has been thinking of you all these years.

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Now you can reunite.

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm happy for you too.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,260
A Yue is now a high-ranking

45
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,660
and excellent demon king.

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,660
She can tell you all these past and future.

47
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,660
It seems that she cares about you.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,660
She cares about me too.

49
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,660
You should rest. I'm leaving.

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
You're awake.

51
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,660
I just passed by.

52
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,660
Come in.

53
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Just say what you want to say.

54
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
You suddenly had a headache yesterday.

55
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
How is it now?

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
You care about me?

57
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm not worried about you.

58
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm just worried about you.

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
You're worried about me?

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,660
You said that we're on the same boat in the Cold Spring Palace.

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
Of course you should care about me.

62
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,660
I've been hurt since I broke out of the Shishan Mountain.

63
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
I have a headache.

64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
But it's strange.

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
The name of the headache

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,660
seems to be the third time yesterday.

67
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Do you have any other symptoms besides headache?

68
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,660
I have some pictures in my mind.

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
I can't see clearly.

70
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
There seems to be some sound.

71
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
But I can't remember clearly now.

72
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
Did I say something

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,660
to make you care so much?

74
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,660
You were really confused at that time.

75
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,660
I didn't hear clearly.

76
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
You're hiding something from me.

77
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
What can I hide from you?

78
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
You're so confused.

79
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
You think too much.

80
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,660
If you don't think too much, how can you live today?

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Are you leaving now?

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I have something to do.

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Take the medicine.

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
I'm not sleeping.

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
It tastes good.

86
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
I hope you're really pregnant.

87
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Not pretending to be pregnant.

88
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,660
You know the truth is to face it better.

89
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Not to be in the past.

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Don't forget.

91
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,660
We're here to collect the tea and the medicine.

92
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
We should cure your bad luck.

93
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
You should cure your bad luck.

94
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,660
So you can protect the person around you.

95
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,660
It's good to have you by my side.

96
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,660
This world is full of murder.

97
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,660
After the dark, we'll go to the forest together.

98
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,660
I want to know why these dead people are in the forest.

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
It seems that Miss Bai is a little bit earlier than me.

100
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
You eat first. I'll go out.

101
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Let's eat together.

102
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,660
I remember you used to love the bun with the most damaged filling.

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,660
I asked my aunt. She said the bamboo shoots in the bamboo tree are in the back mountain.

104
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
I went to the back mountain early in the morning to get the bamboo shoots.

105
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Try them.

106
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Don't do this to me.

107
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Qi Feng, you may not know that the bamboo tree is not at your place now.

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Try to avoid the poison.

109
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,660
It's important for you and Fan Yue to be safe.

110
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,660
I'm reckless.

111
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,660
I just want Yue to try my craft.

112
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
I didn't mean to blame you.

113
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Miss Bai is right. I'm in a bad state now.

114
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
If I really encounter danger, I can't find a way out.

115
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Qi Feng, I care about you.

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Don't worry. I'm here.

117
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I'll protect you.

118
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Since Fan Yue loves to eat, I'll try it too.

119
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,660
Thank you, Qi Feng.

120
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660
Miss Bai is a great cook.

121
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,660
I'll be grateful to her.

122
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Auntie, let me help you.

123
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
No need, Miss Bai. I can do it myself.

124
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
You don't have to be so polite.

125
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
We can stay here and help the deceased.

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Thank you.

127
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,660
The fairy told us that the stone is not a secret.

128
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,660
It's impossible for a monk to have a family.

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Without a family,

130
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
it's impossible for a monk to have a family.

131
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Without a family,

132
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
it's impossible for a monk to have a family.

133
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Without a family,

134
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660
it's impossible for a monk to have a family.

135
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Without a family,

136
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
the deceased are killed by torture.

137
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
The aunt went to the Buji House.

138
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
She invited the owner to help.

139
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
But we've been here for two days.

140
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
But you didn't tell us to find Uncle.

141
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Are you worried?

142
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
Or are you waiting for something?

143
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,660
I'm worried about what's the use of it.

144
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
The owner has his own way of finding out the truth.

145
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
The family doesn't know anything.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
They're waiting for the owner to find out the truth.

147
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
But you don't seem to know anything.

148
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Aunt, the stone is a secret.

149
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,660
I hope you don't hide anything.

150
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
I...

151
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Aunt.

152
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
I heard that the wind is blowing.

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
I made another one for you.

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I hope you like it.

155
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
What? You don't like it?

156
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
No, I don't.

157
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm cooking soup.

158
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
I'll check it out.

159
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Aunt.

160
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
The kitchen is over there.

161
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Look at my age.

162
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
I can't even tell the direction.

163
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
Why do you look at me like that?

164
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Nothing.

165
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,660
I just think that your craftsmanship is better than I thought.

166
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Although Shang Tian took my leg away,

167
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
he left a pair of hands that can be used to live.

168
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
It's still a human being.

169
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
If you need anything, you can tell me.

170
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,660
At least that way, I think it's useful.

171
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Be careful.

172
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Don't move.

173
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
If it's so,

174
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
why do you want to live like this?

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Get away from me now.

176
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Oh, Mother...

177
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Please, stop.

178
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Just one more time.

179
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Take this.

180
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Don't worry.

181
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Every kind of Unterstüt sleeping does not refer to review you.

182
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,240
Be careful.

183
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,720
by posing all over your body.

184
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
One digit for more,

185
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,220
one to imagined.

186
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,680
As long as I can remember where I started,

187
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,920
I don't need to be worried about pain anymore,

188
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,360
especially for the last piece please.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,760
Let's take care of this checkста.

190
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
pupae.

191
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,120
Why are you in a hurry?

192
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
It seems the mirror is not in the way

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
is not as useful as I expected.

194
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
You shouldn't have appeared here!

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,320
Princess,

196
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Chongzhuo came to report to you about the late demon.

197
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
He found you weren't in the room.

198
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,960
That's what you said.

199
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,360
To be the best demon soldier around me.

200
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,360
The best way is to enter my room as you please.

201
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
To explore my secret.

202
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,960
Do you realize the finger I use...

203
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,720
is rascally gone?

204
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
Your head was smashed.

205
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Chongzhuo waslafish.

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,160
His words were just 기官 who didn't panic.

207
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,960
Stop it!

208
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Master!

209
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Master!

210
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Chongzhao broke into Master's room.

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
It's for...

212
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
It's for Tu'er.

213
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
For you?

214
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Chongzhao knows that Tu'er was punished.

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
He's worried that he'll be in Master's room

216
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
and seek the antidote.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
He's not the one who offended Master.

218
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Please let Master know.

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Yes.

220
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
What?

223
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Who?

224
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Don't think that

225
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
the Cold Spring Palace can't leave you.

226
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
In this world,

227
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
no one can replace you.

228
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I understand.

229
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Chongzhao understands.

230
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Get out.

231
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Master

232
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Chongzhao

233
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Master

234
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Chongzhao

235
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I said

236
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
the whole Cold Spring Palace is under Master's control.

237
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
How dare you break into Master's room?

238
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I said

239
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
our grudge has been cleared.

240
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
You have to find a way out.

241
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Some ways seem to be ways out.

242
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
But in fact, it's for more people to find the door.

243
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
The rain in Yicheng is still unknown.

244
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
What's the cause of it?

245
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
The world is in a state of emergency.

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Even if I die,

247
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
I have to find out.

248
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
So

249
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
what did you find?

250
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
In order to take the ancient mirror of the Lianwen,

251
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
did you hear him say it before?

252
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
The ancient mirror?

253
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I never heard Master mention it before.

254
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
But why did he let you go so easily today?

255
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
You defied his order

256
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
and saved me from the dark world.

257
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
You lost his secret today.

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
He let you go because of what I said.

259
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
He seems to have found something

260
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
on me.

261
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Did Master see the dark shadow of Chongzhao?

262
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I think I have

263
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
the power to get rid of the demon.

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
The power to get rid of the demon?

265
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Have you ever noticed?

266
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Only I can see it?

267
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Why did I let you go?

268
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Chongzhao,

269
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Master kept your life.

270
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
You are a wretch.

271
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm afraid you can't find any secrets

272
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
in the cold world anymore.

273
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I suggest you to come back.

274
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
The soup of auntie's soup is so fragrant.

275
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Aunt, why are you so nervous?

276
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Isn't it good to perform these two days?

277
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I've already followed your request.

278
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I've brought the Hall of Fame.

279
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
When will you be able to

280
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
perform the ceremony?

281
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm not sure.

282
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm not sure.

283
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm not sure.

284
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm not sure.

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm not sure.

286
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Master, when will you be able to

287
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
let my husband go?

288
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Then let's see if auntie will listen to me.

289
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
So many years have passed.

290
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Aunt still loves to eat bones.

291
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
From the traces of the sand on these stones

292
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
and the traces of the sand that was worn by the past,

293
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
the murderer should have

294
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
a very powerful steel weapon.

295
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
These weapons can obviously

296
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
kill people.

297
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
The murderer chose to crush them

298
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
and crush them to pieces.

299
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
The murderer, besides torturing them,

300
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
has no purpose.

301
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Maybe these people have something in common.

302
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Something in common?

303
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
No.

304
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
They are all different people in the tribe.

305
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I remember now.

306
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I haven't left the tribe for ten years.

307
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
There are many people in the tribe who are sick.

308
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
It seems that they have found the spiritual medicine.

309
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
They have cured the tribe.

310
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Why didn't you say it earlier?

311
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
What illness did the tribe get?

312
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
I don't know.

313
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Ask my mother.

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Go.

315
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
What's this?

316
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Why is the weapon so heavy?

317
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Master, uncle Bai, let's go.

318
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
This is the real place of the tribe.

319
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Master, I'm fine.

320
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
I've seen the black man's shoulder.

321
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
It's so strange.

322
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
The black man deliberately came here to us.

323
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
He also held us in his arms and only hurt the mountain.

324
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
What's his purpose?

325
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Let's talk about it later.

326
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
What's going on with that stone?

327
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I don't know.

328
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't know.

329
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I don't know.

330
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
I don't know.

331
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
What's going on with that stone?

332
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Actually, our tribe used to live here.

333
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Ten years ago, the demons killed four of them.

334
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Many tribes were killed by the tiger tribe.

335
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Our tribe didn't leave.

336
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
In order to avoid the tiger tribe's chase,

337
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
my father took the people to the private place to rest.

338
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
He went to the mountain valley in the south.

339
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
There was a cloud of spirit there.

340
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
It was hidden in the mountain.

341
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
It was a hidden natural land.

342
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
The people wanted to stay there.

343
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
But they found out

344
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
that there was another tribe of the Shanggu tribe.

345
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
What tribe?

346
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't know.

347
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
When we arrived, they were already killed.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Only a young man was still there,

349
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
guarding the tribe's traces.

350
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
The people were wandering for too long.

351
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
They didn't want to leave.

352
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
They wanted to take the mountain valley.

353
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
But that young man was also there.

354
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
What was he willing to do?

355
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
The people were all around.

356
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
There was a lot of evil.

357
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
But there was a lot of evil.

358
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
They didn't know how to deal with it.

359
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
What did you do?

360
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
That young man was hard-working and didn't leave the tribe.

361
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
My father asked me

362
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
to kill him.

363
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
What?

364
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
After that young man died,

365
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
he started to give up his wish.

366
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
He was a ten-year-old man.

367
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
The tribes couldn't continue their life.

368
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
So he came here again.

369
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
But that young man's wish

370
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
followed him all the way.

371
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
My father and the tribes

372
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
were all around the forest.

373
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
He used the real wish.

374
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
That was the stone needle we just went to.

375
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
The one we took.

376
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
We killed the innocent.

377
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
We killed the innocent.

378
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
No wonder that stone needle was a forbidden one.

379
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
You didn't want to go back

380
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
to the tribe

381
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
and you didn't want to go back to the tribe?

382
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
My father and I quarreled a lot.

383
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
After that,

384
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
I left the tribe and never came back.

385
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
That stone needle was not a young man's wish.

386
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
You still have something to hide from me?

387
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I have no secrets.

388
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
My father and I...

389
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
But if the last blood

390
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
of the Shanggu tribe is killed,

391
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
who will come to revenge?

392
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Did you see

393
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
that young man killed himself?

394
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
My father

395
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
touched his leg.

396
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Blood was shed.

397
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
He couldn't survive.

398
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Your father touched his leg?

399
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Qi Feng's leg was also a long time ago.

400
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
He was also a coincidence.

401
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
There are many coincidences in this world.

402
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
There are many people who are in the world.

403
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
It's not a big deal.

404
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I personally experienced

405
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
that Qi Feng's leg was indeed broken.

406
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
We saw that man in the stone needle.

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
His leg was fine.

408
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
It was not Qi Feng.

409
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Fan Yue, don't think too much.

410
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
I don't want to see him.

411
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Fan Yue, don't think too much.

412
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
It's not true.

413
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

414
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Cang Shan.

415
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
When that young man broke his leg,

416
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
how old was he?

417
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
He was almost 14 or 15 years old.

418
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
That means

419
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
he was about the same age as Fan Yue.

420
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Bai Shu, didn't you say

421
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
that Qi Feng was fat?

422
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I didn't mean to suspect him.

423
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I just didn't want to suspect him in front of Fan Yue.

424
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
He lost all his family members

425
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
overnight.

426
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
It was not easy to get revenge.

427
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Now, he wants to suspect Qi Feng as a murderer.

428
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
It's a kind of torture for him.

429
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
There are no evidence for it.

430
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Before we find out the truth,

431
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
it's not necessary to make Fan Yue sad.

432
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I understand.

433
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Darn it.

434
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
This is it, right?

435
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Those three kids…

436
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
...w 有 mountaineering of cavalries can only be destructed.

437
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
We shouldn't destroy them.

438
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
I assume that or die.

439
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
I assume that, I assume that.

440
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,500
But Wonderful

441
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
What is this?

442
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,560
bouquet of returned children

443
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,420
How can u be ill?

444
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Are you sick?

445
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
No, no, no, no.

446
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
The god of the sky is the god of the sky.

447
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
He always says the opposite to me.

448
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
Then go to hell.

449
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it.

450
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,420
What's the solution?

451
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,420
What did you tell me to do?

452
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Don't ask, don't ask. Tell me.

453
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,420
Human race, you dare to be a loser?

454
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
A loser?

455
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Continue.

456
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,420
I really can't figure out the third one.

457
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Then go to hell.

458
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Forget it, don't ask.

459
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,420
That's the rule.

460
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,420
You must have the spirit of the heaven and earth.

461
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Forget it, the two children are already in my spirit.

462
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Even if you kill me today, I can't figure it out.

463
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Then I'll kill you.

464
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Five years, five years, five years, five years, five years.

465
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
After five years, when I have the spirit of the heaven and earth,

466
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
I'll definitely figure out the third child.

467
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
I'll kill you.

468
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,420
Alright, I trust you this time.

469
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
I'll give you five years.

470
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Five years later, I'll come to you again.

471
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Don't try to fool me.

472
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Otherwise, I'll let this east road go.

473
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
And I'll have no rules.

474
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I also, as Xuan Gui said,

475
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,420
will bring back the first two children from the demons and the human race.

476
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,420
The third child will really have to wait for twenty years?

477
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
The third child, Jiang Jiang Sheng, is...

478
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,420
Where?

479
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
The Fairy Clan.

480
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
When?

481
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Twenty years later.

482
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Twenty years later?

483
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Alright, then in these twenty years,

484
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
you'll stay in the Cold Spring Palace with me.

485
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Then you'll come with me to welcome the child's teacher.

486
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,420
The third child, as the saying goes, has not yet been born.

487
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,420
But just now,

488
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,420
that black seal was clearly on Chong Zhao's body.

489
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Could it be that Xuan Gui is lying to me?

490
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Honorable Superior, I've waited for you for sixty thousand years.

491
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Sixty thousand years,

492
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420
people think that the gods are all in the world and that the world is destroyed.

493
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,420
Who would have thought that the hidden power that Honorable Superior has created

494
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,420
was saved by me.

495
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,420
I haven't changed my mind for sixty thousand years.

496
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Although I don't remember Honorable Superior's magic,

497
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
I've never forgotten your kindness.

498
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,420
That black seal won't be wrong.

499
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Honorable Superior,

500
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
is that really you?

501
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
Honorable Superior,

502
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,420
I will surely find the Five-Nin Stone as soon as possible.

503
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,420
And those three children who are destined to be the gods.

504
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,420
I will return you to the world.

505
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Very soon,

506
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,420
I won't have to miss you anymore from the mirror of the Heavens.

507
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Honorable Superior,

508
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
wait for me.

509
00:27:53,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Xiao Yu,

510
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,420
Miss Ning Yu and Miss Bai, are you done with your see-offs?

511
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,080
No, we haven't lost our lives because we lived in an presented

512
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
issue.

513
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,980
When a kindstheless in the assignment of Bai Ze

514
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,920
I almost died.

515
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,420
We only learnt about the pain of離世.

516
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
And we misunderstood it.

517
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
our spirit,

518
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
only witnessed the change between the two of us.

519
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
I know it the best.

520
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
If there's anything I can help,

521
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
don't tell me.

522
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Qi Feng,

523
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,920
when we entered the forest last night,

524
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
where were you?

525
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
I was in the room.

526
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Yuan,

527
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
you suspect me?

528
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,420
I just want to ask you some questions.

529
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,420
Last time I asked you how your legs were broken.

530
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
You didn't answer my question.

531
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Can you tell me now

532
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
who hurt you?

533
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,420
Do you want to know who hurt me

534
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,920
or who hurt me?

535
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Yuan,

536
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,920
don't you believe me?

537
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,920
We are brothers.

538
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
We won't lie to each other.

539
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
That's why I chose to ask you directly.

540
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
You know that when people are about to get married,

541
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,920
what can they live on?

542
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
It's hope.

543
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,920
I hope I can live on.

544
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,420
I hope I can see you.

545
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,920
The White Cicada is gone.

546
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,420
You are my last love.

547
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
If you want to live on,

548
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
I will give you my life.

549
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I will give you my life.

550
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
I will give you my life.

551
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Qingyue,

552
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
if I can't survive in the other place,

553
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
what should I do?

554
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,420
It's hope.

555
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
I hope I can survive.

556
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
But I didn't expect

557
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,420
you suspect me.

558
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Qi Feng,

559
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I...

560
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
What's going on?

561
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
What's going on?

562
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
What's going on?

563
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
What's going on?

564
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Don't look.

565
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
From the sky,

566
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
such a big shadow

567
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,420
fell from the sky.

568
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
If I hadn't been faster,

569
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
I would have been hit by it.

570
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
It's the one who attacked us.

571
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,420
Who attacked us?

572
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Who attacked us?

573
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,420
Who attacked us?

574
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,420
Who attacked us?

575
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
Isn't the leader missing?

576
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
What's going on?

577
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
What's going on?

578
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Leader.

579
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
It's really him.

580
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,420
Leader.

581
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
How can this be the leader?

582
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Leader.

583
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
Leader.

584
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
It's the mountain man.

585
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
It's you.

586
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
It's you.

587
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
Leader,

588
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,420
it's the wound of the mountain man.

589
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Leader.

590
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,420
Leader,

591
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
it's you who killed the leader.

592
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Father.

593
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

594
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Although the mountain man is the weapon of the mountain,

595
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
how can he hurt the leader?

596
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Leader.

597
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Mountain man,

598
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
explain to everyone.

599
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Explain to everyone.

600
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
What's so good about it?

601
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
You bastard.

602
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Before the matter is cleared,

603
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
who dare to move?

604
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Father.

605
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
Father.

606
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
It's me.

607
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
I killed my father.

608
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
I killed my father.

609
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
I killed my father.

610
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I killed my father.

611
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I killed my father.

612
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
I killed my father.

613
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Cang Shan.

614
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
Sang Jinzhen.

615
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
Leave it to me.

616
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
The mountain man is the leader.

617
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
You see?

618
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
This is the enemy of the man.

619
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Enemy.

620
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
Enemy.

621
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Enemy.

622
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Enemy.

623
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Enemy.

624
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Enemy.

625
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
Enemy.

626
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Enemy.

627
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
You are a traitor.

628
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Enemy.

629
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Enemy.

630
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Enemy.

631
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Traitor.

632
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Traitor.

633
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
You saw the mountain man grow up.

634
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
You should know his temperament.

635
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Even if he is angry with his father,

636
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
it's impossible to kill his father.

637
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
If he is sober,

638
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
maybe not.

639
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
But if he is sick,

640
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
you can't control yourself.

641
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Everyone knows that.

642
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Yes.

643
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
We know that.

644
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
What do you mean?

645
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
What's wrong?

646
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Our clan is much bigger than other forces.

647
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
I don't know why.

648
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Cang Shan is so weak.

649
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
I killed my father.

650
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
He couldn't control his power.

651
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
He often got hurt.

652
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
I killed my father.

653
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I have never seen Cang Shan

654
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
get hurt by his forces.

655
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Nor did I see him hurt himself.

656
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
You have never seen him.

657
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
It doesn't mean he won't.

658
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
The clan is in a bad situation.

659
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
The leader is in a bad situation.

660
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
We have to fight for the people.

661
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Before we find out the truth,

662
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,420
who dares to kill Cang Shan?

663
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
The leader is trying to make up for it.

664
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
What's the point?

665
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,420
I have at least a clear idea.

666
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,420
I have done a lot of things

667
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
that I don't know.

668
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
I have to be clear.

669
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,420
I have to be honest with the people.

670
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
What do you mean?

671
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
I mean

672
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
you know it.

673
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
Cang Shan,

674
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
I will take you there.

675
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
If you are not convinced,

676
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
you can come and try.

677
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Cang Shan,

678
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
I have to go.

679
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
I have to go.

680
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
I have to go.

681
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
I have to go.

682
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
I have to go.

683
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
I have to go.

684
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
I have to go.

685
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
I have to go.

686
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
I have to go.

687
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I have to go.

688
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
I have to go.

689
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
I have to go.

690
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
I have to go.

691
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
I have to go.

692
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I have to go.

693
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
For a foreigner,

694
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
when are you making up for it?

695
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,420
You killed that boy

696
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
and still suppressed his spirit?

697
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
How dare you do something to a foreigner?

698
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
I did everything for the sake of the ten tribes.

699
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Cang Shan,

700
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
I am your father in the end.

701
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,220
No!

702
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,020
My father is a great hero.

703
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,820
He protects the people and the people.

704
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,140
He will never force others to marry him.

705
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,180
He will kill innocent young people.

706
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,780
You don't deserve to be my father!

707
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,380
I don't deserve to be your father.

708
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,180
Get out of my sight!

709
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,980
You can't come back.

710
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,460
I'll be your son

711
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,180
until you die!

712
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,540
I will...

713
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,420
Get lost!

714
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:43,520
But you say no

715
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,900
Why every day i hurt you

716
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,920
No no no

717
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,360
inden

718
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,360
I don't want to

719
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,360
I want to wait for this year

720
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,360
I want to see

721
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
The sea is like a mud

722
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
You are like me

723
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
He has been in the room for a long time

724
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
I'm worried that if he goes on like this

725
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
He will hurt himself in the corner

726
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
The day after the disappearance of the manor

727
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
He suddenly had a cold last night

728
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
What's even more strange

729
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
He can't recognize the mountain

730
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
How could he do that

731
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
It's not that simple

732
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
The situation was chaotic

733
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
He still couldn't get the check

734
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
I'm going to the food

735
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
To check the body of the manor

736
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Let's go together

737
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
You promised me

738
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
As long as I follow your words

739
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
You will let him go

740
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Why do you want to kill him

741
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Why

742
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
You told the truth to Uncle Bai yesterday

743
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Isn't it

744
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
I was afraid

745
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
I should pay some price

746
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,360
But I didn't say it

747
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,360
And you violated our agreement

748
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Then I will complete the agreement

749
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Let you and Uncle Zhang unite

750
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Everything is fine

751
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Other than the knife wounds on his body

752
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
There seems to be no other fatal wound

753
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
But after he was injured last night

754
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
He could clearly open the hide and seek

755
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Why did he suddenly die

756
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
What's this

757
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
There is something inside

758
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
I'm afraid it's this evil bug

759
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
That controlled the body of the manor

760
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
And finally killed him with a wail

761
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Control the body

762
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
It sounds like

763
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
It sounds like

764
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Liangquan Palace

765
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
The manor is the clan leader

766
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
And the spiritual power of the demon clan

767
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,360
This evil bug can control his mind

768
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
I'm curious

769
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
How did this evil bug get into the body

770
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,360
Do you know how this evil bug controlled the person

771
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
There are many evil bugs in the world

772
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I also saw this evil bug for the first time

773
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
But even if there are five bugs and purple bugs

774
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
It can be divided into five bugs and purple bugs

775
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
The person who lost the body can control the five bugs

776
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
And control countless purple bugs

777
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,360
If we find the one who destroyed the five bugs

778
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Can we let all the purple bugs disappear

779
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
This is the reason

780
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
But the person who lost the body won't take out the five bugs so easily

781
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
And the one who destroyed the five bugs

782
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
And the one who destroyed the five bugs

783
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
It's not easy to destroy

784
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
This evil bug is very dangerous

785
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Or that word

786
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
As long as I'm here

787
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Who said that only you can protect me

788
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
I can protect you

789
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Cangshan is still locked in the room

790
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Cangfu's death is in his heart

791
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Maybe you need to open this shop

792
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
There is another person besides Cangshan

793
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,360
It's time to tell the secret of the clan of the lost

794
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,360
You mean the wood?

795
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Yes

796
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,360
The black hand behind the wood controls the wood

797
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Who

798
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
First we will lure the clan of the lost

799
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
And deliberately let Cangshan to open Cangshan's house

800
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
And then frame Cangshan's master

801
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Every step is clear

802
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
The clan of the lost can't be no longer in the game

803
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I even think

804
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
This murderer came from Cangshan

805
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
You are the same as I thought

806
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,360
So we must understand the past grudges before the next accident

807
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
You locked yourself in the room

808
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
You are not ashamed, not eating, not drinking

809
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Your mother will be worried

810
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
You don't deserve my father

811
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,360
This is the last word I told her

812
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
She told me to get out of the clan of the lost

813
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
And never come back

814
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,360
I've been in the clan for so many years

815
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
I've never been back

816
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
I've never been back

817
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
I thought I would never forgive her

818
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
But when she died in front of me

819
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
I found I didn't want to lose her

820
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
I know you are very responsible and sad

821
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Why didn't you come back to the clan earlier?

822
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Why didn't you recognize your father?

823
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Why did you cut off that knife?

824
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,360
But I want to tell you

825
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
This is not your fault

826
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Actually your father was already under a bandit

827
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
before attacking you

828
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
He was no longer in the clan

829
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,360
I told him

830
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
On your father's body

831
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I found a bandit

832
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
He controlled her

833
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
And your father was not dead

834
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
He was killed by the bandit

835
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
by the bandit

836
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Don't touch me

837
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,360
You are a murderer

838
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
You are a murderer

839
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Stop it

840
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Who is the murderer who killed my father and my clan?

841
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
I don't know who it is

842
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
So I have to find the truth

843
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
So that the people of the dead can rest assured

844
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
But they will never come back

845
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
I understand

846
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
The family has already been in danger

847
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
There will be a lot of regrets

848
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Regrets are a kind of long-term

849
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
You can't avoid them

850
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
You can't be too cautious

851
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
We will learn to see each other

852
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
We will learn together

853
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Miss Bai is in a hurry

854
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Where are you going?

855
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
I have something to do with aunt

856
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Aunt

857
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
She went to the back mountain to pick vegetables

858
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
She was taking the blue king out just now

859
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
The father just died

860
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
She is like a stranger

861
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
She is starting to do household chores

862
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I am a stranger

863
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,360
The fate of the tribe is now

864
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I have been in this place for a long time

865
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
I have been wondering

866
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Miss Bai

867
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
I can leave now

868
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
If I have a chance

869
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
I will meet with A-Yue

870
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,360
I will have a place to live

871
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360
Please tell A-Yue to give me a place

872
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,360
I will go to the back mountain

873
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360
I will take care of the family

874
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,360
I will take care of the family

875
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,360
I will take care of the family

876
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Please tell A-Yue to give me a place

877
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
I won't say goodbye

878
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,360
You are the one who met Fan Yue

879
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Do you really want to leave?

880
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Do you want me to keep you for a long time

881
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,360
Or do you want Fan Yue to blame me for not keeping you?

882
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Miss Bai, you misunderstood

883
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I am just afraid that I can't bear to say goodbye to Xing Lan and A-Yue

884
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,360
I am also afraid that I will delay your investigation

885
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Be careful

886
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
Qi Feng

887
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
Qi Feng

888
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Qi Feng

889
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
I am sorry

890
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
I am sorry

891
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
I am sorry
