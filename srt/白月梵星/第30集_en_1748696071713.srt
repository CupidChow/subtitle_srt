1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Mistre bonsai

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I only want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The world is here.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I only want to be with you forever.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My life is clear.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
My life is true.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We live together.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We die together.

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All I wanna see is you.

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
All I want is you to hear me out.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,480
No, it's just that the moon and stars tonight

19
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
are like the time I was in the Divine Jade.

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,840
It reminds me of some of the things that happened a long time ago.

21
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Who are they?

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
I...

23
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
You don't have to feel guilty.

24
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
I didn't mean to.

25
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
I just saw you these past two days.

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
You must be missing your old friend.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fan Yue.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's so late. Where is he going?

29
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,360
We're in the Puti Village to find the old ghost.

30
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,480
Now that we've found the old ghost,

31
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
we should leave.

32
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,480
Tomorrow morning,

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,520
Bai Shu and I will go back to the Moon Palace.

34
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you that smart?

35
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm not.

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

38
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
What?

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Can you stay for a few more days?

41
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I understand.

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Fan Yue is a little bit of a fool.

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm guilty of the Goddess,

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
but I'm just going to leave.

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Yes.

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
You're not her.

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
But you have the same eyes as me.

48
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Miss Bai.

49
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Shu.

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm not going to go to the Moon Palace.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Miss Bai, don't go to the Moon Palace.

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You don't have to explain to Fan Yue.

54
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm sure I believe in her since I've been through it.

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
You and the Goddess are in the same mind.

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm jealous of you.

57
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm going back to the Moon Palace.

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Goddess.

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
It's been so many years.

60
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I can't go back.

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Do you want to leave Puti Village

62
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
to see what you've been doing in the past?

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I've done what I have to do 60,000 years ago.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Since there's no end to the world,

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I don't need the Moon anymore.

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I just want to keep it in a quiet place

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
and keep it in peace.

68
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Maybe in my heart,

69
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'll always feel that

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
as long as I don't forget,

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
it will always be in my heart.

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Does it hurt?

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
No.

74
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I know.

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
We've been through so much together.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I won't suspect our relationship.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Even if you have a demon and a magical memory,

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
they may live longer than us

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
and have a strong magical power.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
But our relationship

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
is not as strong as the relationship

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
of any other relationship in the world.

83
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I just think that

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
it's too much for me.

85
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I just think that he's a little pitiful.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
He's a little guilty.

87
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Uncle,

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
even if it's a god,

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
it may not be true.

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Even if it's a guilty person,

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
it should be me who's guilty, not you.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I just want to find the last thing

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
and put you on the seven stars to go back to the Yin Xiao Chu.

94
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Love is cruel and greedy.

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Now there's only him left.

96
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
But there's no way to start a relationship.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Love is him.

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Sin is him.

99
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
If you think about it,

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
you'll get what you want.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
He may exist in any corner of the world.

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
He may also exist in anyone's heart.

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
It's too much for me.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Before the previous four years,

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
there were all kinds of precepts.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I believe that the fifth year

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
will definitely come.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Fengyue,

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
we can definitely be together for a long time.

110
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Yes.

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
The village has been hidden by people's spiritual power.

112
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I've been looking for the hidden power of Chong Zhou.

113
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
It seems that Chong Zhou is in the village.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
The Blue Spirit Realm.

115
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
The power?

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
It's been 60,000 years.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
I didn't expect that there would still be the Yin Clan in the world.

118
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Although you look like a demon,

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
you're still a demon.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I didn't expect that the Blue Spirit Realm

121
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
still exists in the past.

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You can live well even if you're a small child of the Yin Clan.

123
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm blessed by the God of Light.

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Why can't I?

125
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Why are you here?

126
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
He doesn't know the identity of Chong Zhou.

127
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
The Five-Ninetic Stone is the treasure of the God Realm.

128
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
The people who are now in the Five-Ninetic Stone are in the village.

129
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm sure that the people who are now in the Five-Ninetic Stone

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
are all from the God Realm.

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I can't let you do it.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
When I drew the spirit around the Demon God,

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
you didn't even get up.

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You thought you were my opponent.

135
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I saw that there were still some of the elements in the spirit.

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I won't argue with you today.

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Don't think about the people in the village's mind.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
They are all mine.

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Get lost.

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I haven't fully recovered from my injuries.

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I can't be hit.

142
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
It seems that I have to get out of this Blue Spirit Realm.

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I was in a mess last night.

144
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't need to talk about it again.

145
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
It's just that what are you going to do about the Blue Spirit and Chong Zhou?

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Chong Zhou just met his parents.

147
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
He will probably stay in the Pudi for a few more days.

148
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
As for the Blue Spirit...

149
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Miss Bai! Miss Bai!

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Miss Bai, your master is...

151
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
What happened to my master?

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Your master went to pick the medicine early in the morning.

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
He fell asleep and fell down.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
He fell asleep and fell down.

155
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Master!

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Tu Er, you finally came.

157
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
How are you?

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm afraid it's you and me who are in the last place in the Pudi Realm.

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Please forgive me.

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Don't say that.

161
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
You are so tired of this.

162
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Where are you going? I'll help you get the medicine.

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
This is not the Blue Spirit Realm.

164
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
There's no medicine.

165
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I went to pick the medicine only because of this.

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Then I fell down from the mountain.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Fan Yue, please look after my master.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll go pick the medicine.

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll go with you.

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
No, no, no.

171
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
You can't leave me alone.

172
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
You two have to stay alone to accompany me.

173
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
If anything bad happens to you,

174
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll be helpless now.

175
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
You don't have to be so polite.

176
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'll go with you.

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
You stay and take care of master.

178
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I'll go back quickly.

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Be careful, master.

180
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Be careful, master.

181
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Fortunately, you are here, Xie.

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Don't be afraid.

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm here.

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
No matter what happens,

185
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll come to your side first

186
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
to protect you.

187
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
The kind of firecrackers just now

188
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
are very common in the two castles.

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
If you can't keep them for long,

190
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
they will be burned to ashes.

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
You can't just leave them alone.

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
What did you just call me?

193
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Why did you save me?

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I remember you

195
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
asking me this way when you were in the lake.

196
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'll tell you now.

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
This short knife

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
was given to me by my sister Bai Xi.

199
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Your knife is none of my business.

200
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Xi said that

201
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
no matter what happens to me,

202
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
he'll come to me first.

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll take care of him.

204
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I'll go with you.

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I'll go with you.

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll go with you.

207
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I'll go with you.

208
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I'll go with you.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll go with you.

210
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll go with you.

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I'll go with you.

212
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
She said

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
that if she's around me,

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
I don't need to worry about anything.

215
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
What's the point then?

216
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I've already told you

217
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
that Bai Xi is dead.

218
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
You can't believe it.

219
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Then why did you show up?

220
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Why did you save me?

221
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
If you were a ghost,

222
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
you shouldn't have let me die.

223
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I've been passing by for a while.

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Sometimes I feel good.

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I have to ask why.

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
It seems that I should be worse.

227
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'll tell you one last time.

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm not Bai Xi.

229
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I want to be a ghost.

230
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Don't bother me anymore.

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Shuang,

232
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm sorry, father.

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm sorry, too.

234
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
How can I be with you?

235
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
And everything is so simple.

236
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I'll be in the poison room

237
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
for a month.

238
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I've been living for days.

239
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Even if I'm a man,

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
what should I do?

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
How is master?

242
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
He's fine.

243
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
He fell asleep just now.

244
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
What's wrong with you?

245
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
You seem to have something on your mind.

246
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I just took the medicine in the mountain.

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I accidentally met the dead flower.

248
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
The dead flower?

249
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Did you get hurt?

250
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm fine.

251
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Don't worry.

252
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
It's...

253
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Fulin appeared in a hurry.

254
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
He saved me.

255
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Fulin?

256
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
If he wasn't A Xi,

257
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
why would he risk his life?

258
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
But he didn't admit that he was A Xi.

259
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
You've been through a lot.

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
If I were him,

261
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
maybe I wouldn't admit it.

262
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Give him some time.

263
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Give yourself some time.

264
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll go get the medicine for master.

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
If I knew it was so dangerous,

266
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I wouldn't have let you go to the mountain to pick the medicine.

267
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Fulin and you are in the same team.

268
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Why would he save you?

269
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Could it be that he found you a good friend?

270
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Tong Er, what's wrong?

271
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Master.

272
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
People often say that mistakes can change the world.

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
But if someone makes a big mistake,

274
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
can it be the end?

275
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
You ask me such a question.

276
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't know who you are talking about.

277
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
But I think

278
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
everyone in this world can make choices.

279
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,200
And everyone can live according to their own will.

280
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,200
But the hateful people may have their own pitiful place.

281
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Tong Er.

282
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Why are you asking this suddenly?

283
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Did Fan Yuan's boy come to see you?

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
It's not him.

285
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
It's A Xi.

286
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
A Xi?

287
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
You... you sister.

288
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Remember.

289
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Don't touch it.

290
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
With your demon king protecting Shu,

291
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
no one will dare to bully him.

292
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Why are you here?

293
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Just like you.

294
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm here to investigate.

295
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You're suspicious?

296
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
My parents recorded this village in the palm trees.

297
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm curious why they could enter the village

298
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
and hide here for ten years.

299
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
They were so suspicious.

300
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
They didn't even know they could enter.

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
And they hid here for ten years.

302
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Then do you believe in this palm tree

303
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
or do you believe in them now?

304
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I don't know.

305
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm afraid to face the truth.

306
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
No matter which is real or false,

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
it's not a good thing for me.

308
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
You mean your sister is the reason?

309
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I don't understand.

310
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
If she's A Xi,

311
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
why would she do that to her father?

312
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Unless she doesn't know she's A Xi.

313
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Do you want to confirm

314
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
that she's really the real one?

315
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
You have a way.

316
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Even if she's a master.

317
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
But she has a god daughter.

318
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Hua Lingding?

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I heard from my master that she's a good wife.

320
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
She can write a letter of resignation.

321
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
You want to give her a resignation?

322
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I have my own way.

323
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
If the god daughter wants to use this treasure,

324
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
she'll definitely give it to her.

325
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
What kind of gift will you give her?

326
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
As long as I can give her anything she wants,

327
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
she can give it to her.

328
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Miss Bai is a new person in Fan Yue.

329
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
She's my friend.

330
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Even if she's a friend,

331
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
how could I be so stubborn?

332
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
This is Hua Lingding you want.

333
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
As long as I can see your blood

334
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
in the top of my head,

335
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I can see that you're a close friend.

336
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Thank you, Miss Bai.

337
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I owe you a favor.

338
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
No need.

339
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
I hope you can get the result you want.

340
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Come out.

341
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Congratulations, god daughter.

342
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
You're going to get what you want soon.

343
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
It seems that you're still worth it.

344
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
For god's sake, I'm a little injured.

345
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
It's not a big deal.

346
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
But there's something I'm curious about.

347
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Why didn't you kill her directly?

348
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Kill her?

349
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Fan Yue will always remember her.

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Why should I give her my life?

351
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm not going to let her go.

352
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I don't want to remember her.

353
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Why should I give her my life?

354
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
By the way, how's that old man?

355
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
That old man is not going to return now.

356
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Once he's completely dead,

357
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
you can have everything he wants.

358
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Whether it's the body shape,

359
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
the vitality,

360
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
or the number of the chain of the darts.

361
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Thank you, god daughter.

362
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
For so many years,

363
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I've been relying on the spirit of the Xishi Clan

364
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
to maintain the human form.

365
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
This time, I've changed the way to treat Yong Yi.

366
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
But god daughter,

367
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I still don't understand one thing.

368
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Although you and the demon god are old friends,

369
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
but it's still a matter of 60,000 years ago.

370
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
The demon god is no longer the demon god.

371
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Now Fan Yue has forgotten everything.

372
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Why do you insist on talking to him?

373
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You're just a fake who's been made by the Xishi Clan.

374
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
How can you understand?

375
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
He's been using the spirit of the demon god to make me live.

376
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
The one I'm left with is his blood.

377
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Even if it's 60,000 years old,

378
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
even if he forgets everything,

379
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
as long as I'm alive,

380
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I'll be fine.

381
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
The blood of the demon god

382
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
that's moving,

383
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
the blood of the demon god,

384
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm no longer in the heart of this.

385
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm only because of him.

386
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,200
And he must be mine.

387
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Fuling, are you really A-xi?

388
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
I have so many questions in my heart.

389
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
If you're A-xi,

390
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
why would you have a human form

391
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
and why would you force your father to die?

392
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Now, I want a clear answer.

393
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Ah!

394
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
It's you.

395
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
What have you done to me?

396
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
You wrote it yourself.

397
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
What can I do?

398
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
What is this?

399
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I came here just to tell you.

400
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I accidentally remembered it wrong.

401
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
This painting top is not used to write the signature.

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
It's used to marry you.

403
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
What do you mean?

404
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Don't worry. You'll know soon enough.

405
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Don't waste your time.

406
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Your body is already controlled by the blood in the top.

407
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,160
You've been pretending?

408
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
That's right.

409
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
I've been calculating since you entered the Pure Land.

410
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I know why you met the Xiji of the Ten-Hen Flower.

411
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Fulin came to save you by such a coincidence.

412
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I know you've been guessing if Fulin is your sister.

413
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
He doesn't admit it, but he's actually paying attention to it.

414
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll just push it and see if he'll save you.

415
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
He did save you?

416
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Then you'd better know his identity.

417
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
You did it on purpose.

418
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I finally used the painting top to make you use it.

419
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
No.

420
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,160
It was the master who asked me to use the treasure to make you use it.

421
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
He's not my master.

422
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
You're so smart.

423
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
What a pity.

424
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
The master you called out to me these days

425
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,160
was just a fake person I made with my own body.

426
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Where is my real master?

427
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
He's also in the Pure Land.

428
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Don't worry. You'll see him in the future.

429
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Now, let's solve our problem.

430
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
No...

431
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Fulin is mine.

432
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Fanyue is mine, too.

433
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Array.

434
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,760
...it's eventually mine.

435
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,160
How strange.

436
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,720
Whatięs have been happening into the mountains?

437
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
This weapon can't be removed with its spiritual power.

438
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
It doesn't seem to be a normal palm.

439
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
This is the place where the Pudis Village entered and left.

440
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
If we don't get rid of the palm, we won't be able to find the way out.

441
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Let's go ahead and take a look.

442
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Fengyu, Chongzhao.

443
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Aren't you taking care of the old lady? Why are you here?

444
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
The master's medicine is already gone.

445
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I found you missing.

446
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
I'm afraid you'll be out to look for you if you're not safe.

447
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
What are you doing here?

448
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
We think this village is a bit strange.

449
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
We can't get out of the Pudis Village anymore.

450
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
We can't get rid of such a huge Pudis Village for a while.

451
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,160
It's late now. It's more dangerous to enter the night.

452
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Why don't we go back first and wait for tomorrow?

453
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
It's okay.

454
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Let's go.

455
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
The Pudis Village

456
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Why did you suddenly go to the back mountain?

457
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,160
If the Pudis Village attacks you, I'll go and seek revenge for it.

458
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
The Pudis Village is so cruel.

459
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,160
I don't want you to get hurt for me.

460
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
What's wrong?

461
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Nothing.

462
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I thought you'd say I was a little bit too big.

463
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I was going to look for a flower to take revenge on.

464
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
I don't think I care about you.

465
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
You're not happy about it.

466
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I didn't mean that. Sit down.

467
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
I just think that everything in this village is not so good.

468
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
That's why I wanted to figure it out.

469
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Chongzhao's parents suddenly appeared here when he was gone for ten years.

470
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,160
The old man came here and fell off the cliff.

471
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,160
The Pudis Village attacked you and now there's a dense fog.

472
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
This thing is only a matter of one thing.

473
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
It seems like there's nothing to worry about.

474
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
But I still think that the back is definitely not simple.

475
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
It seems like...

476
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,160
It seems like someone deliberately wants to keep us here.

477
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Then who do you think it is?

478
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,160
If the people in the village are deliberately hiding,

479
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
and my waist can't even be separated,

480
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
then there's only one person in this Pudis Village who can do it.

481
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
I'll go and regret it.

482
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
It's getting dark.

483
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Come back soon.

484
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
What did you find?

485
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I've already found a big fog in the mountains.

486
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
It seems that someone deliberately made up the tent.

487
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Big fog?

488
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Do you have other findings?

489
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Are you still being so suspicious about Uncle and Auntie?

490
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm not sure.

491
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm just curious.

492
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm not sure.

493
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
You haven't seen each other for ten years.

494
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
It's normal that you've had some feelings of loss.

495
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
It's been too long.

496
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
I should have treasured every moment of the group.

497
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,160
But I always feel that I don't have that kind of emotional sense of belonging.

498
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Do you think it's my problem or are they really having problems?

499
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Miss Zhuang, Miss Fulin, you're here for dinner.

500
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Coming.

501
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Come on, Miss Fulin. Thank you.

502
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Come, eat, Zhou'er.

503
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Zhou'er, why don't you eat?

504
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Is it because I made the dishes that don't suit your appetite?

505
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
No.

506
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I found that a big fog was rising in the mountains.

507
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I was so worried that I couldn't eat.

508
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
I was so worried that I couldn't eat.

509
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I was so worried that I couldn't eat.

510
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
No.

511
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
I found that a big fog was rising in the mountains.

512
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
I was so worried that I couldn't eat.

513
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Do you know what's going on?

514
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
A big fog?

515
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Maybe it's because the weather is bad.

516
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
What? You're leaving?

517
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Chongzhao just joined your group.

518
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
How could he leave?

519
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
It's good that you're not leaving.

520
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Let's go.

521
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Do you really want us to stay?

522
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
What are you talking about?

523
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Your mother and I haven't seen you for ten years.

524
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
We finally meet again.

525
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
We hope to spend more time with you.

526
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Let's go together.

527
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
We can go back to Nian'an City or Lanlin.

528
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
We can live a normal life.

529
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Zhou'er, we've been living here for ten years.

530
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
We're used to living here.

531
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
We don't want to suffer anymore.

532
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
You can stay here for a hundred years.

533
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
You've been living here for ten years.

534
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Or are you afraid of something?

535
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Mother, you met Bai Xi when you were hunting for the sand, right?

536
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
You told him to tell me not to go back to Lanlin again.

537
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Who is the one who is chasing after you?

538
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Hemen, He-Pai, He-Ren.

539
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,160
You won't forget the enemy who is going to take your life, right?

540
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Father, you and master are good friends.

541
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you know what you're hiding in the Pu Ti Village?

542
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Chongzhao.

543
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
So what do you mean now?

544
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Do you know what you're doing?

545
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
You're forcing your parents to do it.

546
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
You're doubting your master.

547
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I just want to know the truth.

548
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
How did your mother and I teach you?

549
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
It's been ten years.

550
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Do you even remember the most funny thing?

551
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
You're so mad at me.

552
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Why are you angry with the child?

553
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Enough. Stop it.

554
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
She's already suspicious. What should we do now?

555
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Don't be nervous.

556
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
The Goddess said that their business is very normal.

557
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
As long as the Goddess is not angry, everything will be fine.

558
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Then I hope that the Goddess will get what she wants soon.

559
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Only she is happy.

560
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Our lives will be better.

561
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
I know you have a lot of doubts.

562
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
But you were too excited just now.

563
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I don't want to be excited.

564
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
But I can't control myself.

565
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I really hope that everything will be back to the way it was.

566
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
But why is it getting worse and worse?

567
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,160
My father taught me to be a good wife.

568
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Not to rely on the sound and the location.

569
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
But he just laughed at me.

570
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
He was trying to avoid it.

571
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Maybe he had a sense of duty before.

572
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,160
But I think they are not my parents.

573
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
But if they were fake, why did they do that?

574
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,160
And why did they look the same as your parents?

575
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
If I observe these two days,

576
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
they are not a pair of two-headed men.

577
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
They are not the same.

578
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
You heard the story of Shangguan's period.

579
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
It's a secret.

580
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:14,380
The

581
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
God's Kitchen

582
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
You must not enter.

583
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Who are you?

584
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I am the only female Qin Jiang in Puti Village.

585
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
God's Kitchen is closed for now.

586
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Please go back.

587
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Closed?

588
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
That's good.

589
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
The hall is full of herbs.

590
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I will see what kind of disease God's Kitchen is.

591
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
It's better to treat the herbs.

592
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
The God's Kitchen just went to bed.

593
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Please go out.

594
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Feiyun!

595
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Feiyun!

596
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
What's wrong with her?

597
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
There is a God's Kitchen in Puti Village.

598
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,160
All the herbs in the village are made by God's Kitchen.

599
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
God's Kitchen is too much for the spirit power.

600
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
It takes a few days to get up.

601
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,160
So, the mystery of the village is also what she said?

602
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
God knows that he will get up

603
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,160
and he will be in trouble if there is no other place to hide.

604
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
That's why the mystery is so important.

605
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,160
God knows that he will get up and he will be in trouble if he wakes up.

606
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
But now, he still wants to leave you.

607
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
He doesn't want to disturb the God's Kitchen.

608
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Feiyun!

609
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Don't be upset!

610
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Feiyun!

611
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Feiyun!

612
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
You have been possessed by the God's Kitchen.

613
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
You are so evil.

614
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Even if you shout, he won't listen.

615
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Just lie down like this.

616
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
How is it going?

617
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
I've been sleeping all night.

618
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
I'll wake up in a few days.

619
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Do you believe it?

620
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
No.

621
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Then, with your personality,

622
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
you won't be a god to him.

623
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Why are you back like this?

624
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Don't tell me you still have the old love you had for him 60,000 years ago.

625
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I didn't.

626
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I know.

627
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I'm just kidding.

628
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
It's late.

629
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
You should rest early.

630
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Tomorrow is the day.

631
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
You can solve it tomorrow.

632
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
This is your first time to be more suspicious.

633
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Is it bad?

634
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
It's okay.

635
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I can do it myself.

636
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
He's here.

637
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
I suddenly remembered that

638
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Master hasn't taken the medicine yet.

639
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
I'll go and check on him.

640
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
You should rest.

641
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
I'll be back soon.

642
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Master, you're going to kill us?

643
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
I'm so energetic.

644
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
How is it going?

645
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Goddess?

646
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
You've gained the body of Bai Shu.

647
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Did you find out about the Moon?

648
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
What?

649
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
You're questioning my ability?

650
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
I don't think so.

651
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I can't do anything about it.

652
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I'm just curious about the Moon.

653
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm not sure.

654
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm just curious about the Moon.

655
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm just curious about how you can change your body

656
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
from the one you don't know.

657
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Don't ask too much.

658
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Why did you come here so suddenly?

659
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I've gained a lot of spiritual power

660
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
with this change of the白.

661
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I need to make up for it.

662
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
I'll send some new ancestors in.

663
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
You don't want to?

664
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
When the Moon came to my house

665
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
and I left the house,

666
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I stopped it on purpose.

667
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,160
I just wanted to use it to find the person who can gather the Five Names.

668
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Now Bai Shu has been gathering the Four Names

669
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
and is only a step away from success.

670
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
When the Goddess takes her body away from this time,

671
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
the Five Names cannot gather.

672
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
If the Five Names are not gathered,

673
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
it cannot open the power of the God.

674
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I only want the Moon.

675
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,160
As for whether the Five Names can be opened,

676
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I don't care.

677
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Jin Yao,

678
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
these years I've sent you the new magic secret

679
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
to help you practice.

680
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
I've sent you the position of the first-hand.

681
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
You've gained a lot.

682
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
You're not satisfied.

683
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
You still want the power of the Five Names.

684
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,160
The people who are greedy will never be good at fighting.

685
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
You have the best skills.

686
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Don't forget that I gave you everything you have today.

687
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
I can take it back anytime.

688
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Ten.

689
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Do you really want to die?

690
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Who?

691
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
You can hear my voice?

692
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,160
You are the first one in so many years.

693
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Don't look for it.

694
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I'm right in front of you.

695
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Don't worry, Demon King.

696
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Demon King?

697
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Do you really want to die?

698
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,160
If you want, I'll help you.

699
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Why don't you answer?

700
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
You don't want to answer, or dare not answer?

701
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,160
You dare not die, and dare not die.

702
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Who are you?

703
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm not a demon, nor a fairy.

704
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
You should know that there was a god in the world.

705
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
A god? You are...

706
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Demon King

707
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Jin Yao, I know everything about you.

708
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Your parents died early, and your family fell apart.

709
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
It was not easy for you to leave the Pure Land.

710
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
You entered the Lanling Palace,

711
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
but you were suppressed by the gate,

712
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
and you were crushed by the enemy.

713
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
You are in pain, aren't you?

714
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Why?

715
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Why do people have everything when they were born?

716
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,160
I can't even get a chance to be fair!

717
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,160
There is no fair in the world.

718
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
If you want to be a human, I can help you.

719
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I can give you great power.

720
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,160
I wish you to be a fairy in the Lanling Palace.

721
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I wish you to be a blessing to the people who have invaded you.

722
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Whether it's the brother who is a despicable and despicable,

723
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
or the master who is a heartless and ungrateful person,

724
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
as long as you think about it,

725
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,160
they will all disappear from this world.

726
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Don't you want such a good chance?

727
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
If you don't want it, then you can...

728
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Wait!

729
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
What condition?

730
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
What do you want me to do?

731
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
60,000 years ago, the Great War of the Divine Yard was destroyed by my spirit.

732
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
I was awakened by the crystal of the water.

733
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I need to absorb the spirit of the Fairy Clan to keep the human form.

734
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,160
You just need to give me some of the Fairy Clan at the right time.

735
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
A little bit of a busyness.

736
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
You don't need to sacrifice anything.

737
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,160
You just need to forget your conscience.

738
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
That's all.

739
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
The Great War of the Divine Yard

740
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I, the Goddess, will do my best to save the world.

741
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I will never give up my power.

742
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
But there is one more thing.

743
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Please help me.

744
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
What is it?

745
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,160
When I was in the arrest of the Grand Master Meng Ning,

746
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,160
I accidentally met the sister of Bai Shu.

747
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Bai Xi.

748
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Father!

749
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Come and save me, Father!

750
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
Back then, Bai Xi was just a child of the human clan.

751
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
She was taken by my parents.

752
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
She didn't die.

753
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
She even became the current Fulin.

754
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
It's interesting that she didn't die even after being taken by her parents.

755
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,160
I'm not sure if she saw my face at that time.

756
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Please punish Fulin and Chong Zhao for not being respectful.

757
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
It's not strange to kill Fulin.

758
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
But Chong Zhao is your disciple.

759
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,160
You are also very careful about your disciple.

760
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
She already suspected me.

761
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
She should kill her.

762
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
Sometimes, I'm quite curious.

763
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,160
If the world's ancestors knew their newbie,

764
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
they would be so heartless and heartless.

765
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,160
What would the most evil person look like?

766
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
I have things to do.

767
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
You can go back first.

768
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,160
I will consider the matter in the Bodhi Village.

769
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,160
You don't need to ask for your hand.

770
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Yes, I will follow your instructions.

771
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,160
You are different from the past.

772
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,160
The person who is far away, don't be afraid.

773
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,160
The stars will only smile at you.

774
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Come, come.

775
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,160
My heart is so excited.

776
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Wait for me.

777
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,160
The stars will only smile at you.

778
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,160
You are the light I want to see.

779
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,160
You are the only way.

780
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,160
Let this moment be with you.

781
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Let this moment be with you.

782
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,160
The stars will only smile at you.

783
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,160
You are the only way.

784
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Let this moment be with you.

785
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Let this moment be with you.

786
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Let this moment be with you.

787
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,160
I love you.
