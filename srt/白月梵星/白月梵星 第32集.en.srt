1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,580
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimesâ€¦

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 32]

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,740
She actually broke out of my sea of consciousness.

20
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,790
Impossible!

21
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,920
You're of the Divine Race, but so what?

22
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,740
Didn't you still

23
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,180
lose to my disciple?

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,170
You're dead!

25
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,680
Master, are you alright?

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm good.

27
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,320
I knew there was nothing

28
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,620
that could trap you.

29
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,400
Since you're all here,

30
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,490
none of you are leaving!

31
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,600
Chong Zhao,

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,530
take Master and Fu Ling away first.

33
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,860
Be careful!

34
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,700
Let's go!

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
How did you break out of the sea of consciousness?

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,270
I have to thank you for the reminder.

37
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,820
A seal created by divine power

38
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,480
can only be broken by divine power.

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,640
Don't forget,

40
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
I have the Contemplation Stone in me.

41
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,850
With your power, you could have easily killed me.

42
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,910
Why did you choose to trap me in the sea of consciousness

43
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,370
and trick Chong Zhao into killing me instead?

44
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,610
I told you,

45
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,950
as long as you gave up Bai Shuo,

46
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,160
I'd tell you where the last Contemplation is.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
Then you wouldn't have to die,

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,540
and we could be together forever.

49
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,380
Why did you still choose her?

50
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,720
Jing Yuan,

51
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,370
I once stayed by your side day and night.

52
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,580
Have you truly forgotten everything?

53
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,850
I'm not Jing Yuan.

54
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,210
I don't care who you are either.

55
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,310
To me,

56
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,530
you've committed too many sins,

57
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,040
and you deserve death.

58
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,740
I deserve death?

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
I've waited for you for 60,000 years

60
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,659
only to hear this?

61
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,990
You say you're not Jing Yuan,

62
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,409
but what you've always loved

63
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,490
is just Xing Yue's outward appearance!

64
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,670
You've been bewitched by her,

65
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,650
unable to distinguish true love from fake feelings.

66
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,530
You really think you have true love

67
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,670
that will last forever?

68
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,790
What a joke!

69
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,550
The world reveres, worships, and admires her.

70
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,960
But do you know

71
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,990
Xing Yue's everlasting reputation

72
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,420
was built, bit by bit,

73
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,290
on your dead body?

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,010
What do you mean?

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,190
Bai Shuo once asked me

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,180
why I have so much hostility toward her.

77
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,740
I'll tell you now.

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,250
Because during the Divine War 60,000 years ago,

79
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,020
it was Xing Yue who killed you.

80
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,350
And Bai Shuo

81
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,100
carries Xing Yue's Divine Mantle!

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,540
The past is the past.

83
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,360
The grudges and entanglements from 60,000 years ago

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,520
were between Jing Yuan and Xing Yue.

85
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,850
They have nothing to do with me!

86
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,790
You are not him

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
after all.

88
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,340
Since you're heartless,

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,720
I don't have to hold back anymore.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,560
The divine power of those puppets

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,880
has all been absorbed back into her body.

92
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,770
Since you love each other so much,

93
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,350
I'll grant your wish

94
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,410
and let you live and die together!

95
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,320
Reclaiming the divine power is her backup plan.

96
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
We have one too.

97
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,230
Do you remember?

98
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,830
My blood can make demons stronger.

99
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,080
The tides of the Lunar Hidden Sea have ebbed and flowed for tens of thousands of years,

100
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,480
creating some crystals.

101
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,960
I found them interesting and collected them.

102
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,850
You don't like jewelry,

103
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,490
but this is made of stone.

104
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,090
Lunar Lord, you won't refuse it, will you?

105
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,180
In scattered flowers and flying petals,

106
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,790
my once youthful face has changed.

107
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,720
It turns out that

108
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,210
what is truly eternal

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,290
has never been you and me.

110
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,660
My master.

111
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,010
Lanling isn't a place you can come and go as you please.

112
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,190
But, Sect Leader,

113
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,100
didn't you still let me in?

114
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,540
If you come uninvited again,

115
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,840
I'll have to deal with you according to the laws of Lanling.

116
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,030
The laws?

117
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,080
Will Lanling still need laws in the future?

118
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,490
Won't you, Sect Leader,

119
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,580
be the law of Lanling?

120
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,550
I've been killing demons according to the map you gave me,

121
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,980
and I've given all the demon cores to you.

122
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,290
What else do you want?

123
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,510
Here,

124
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,020
a new map of the demon clans.

125
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,420
I need more demon cores

126
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,930
to restore my vitality.

127
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,820
I hope

128
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,830
you can keep up the good work.

129
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,560
This battle was won too easily.

130
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,160
If things continue to go so smoothly,

131
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,360
it'll surely arouse suspicion among other High Eternals.

132
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,590
If anyone suspects anything,

133
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,860
just send them

134
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
to Bodhi Village

135
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,720
and be done with it.

136
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,620
Don't worry, Sect Leader.

137
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,760
In the demon-slaying battles,

138
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,380
the fame and glory

139
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,630
will all be yours.

140
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,740
You'll become

141
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,300
the undisputed head

142
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,250
of the Eternals.

143
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,840
Why is there suddenly a disturbance in my spiritual power?

144
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,670
Has something

145
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,080
happened to Luan Zhu?

146
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,280
No!

147
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,740
The powers of Eternals and demons are incompatible.

148
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,500
Both Fan Yue and I are demons,

149
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,200
and you also carry demonic power within you.

150
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,270
Right now, only Bai Shuo can help him.

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,170
Master.

152
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,990
You're finally awake.

153
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,570
I've lived for over 1,000 years.

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,430
I've experienced everything.

155
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,850
I won't die.

156
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,700
Master,

157
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,320
how did you end up in Bodhi Village?

158
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,130
It was Jin Yao.

159
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,620
I accidentally discovered that he's

160
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,440
secretly adopted ancient mental cultivation methods.

161
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
So, he captured me and brought me to Bodhi Village

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,530
as an offering to Luan Zhu.

163
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,790
The corpses in that cave

164
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,220
were all Eternals sent here by Jin Yao.

165
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,770
Every time Luan Zhu drains an Eternal,

166
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,120
she creates a puppet

167
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,060
identical to them.

168
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
All of this

169
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,770
was actually done by Sect Leader.

170
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,990
Then what about my parents?

171
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,490
Did my parents really die in Bodhi Village?

172
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,580
Well...

173
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,860
I don't know.

174
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,970
At least, their remains were not in the cave.

175
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,710
Luan Zhu has drained countless Eternals

176
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,680
over the centuries.

177
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,890
Perhaps

178
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,050
they've been hidden somewhere else.

179
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,440
There's something

180
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,050
I've been keeping inside for a very long time.

181
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,890
Now that everyone is here,

182
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,320
it's time for me to face it.

183
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,310
You've always

184
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,080
wanted to know

185
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,720
why I've been hiding in Lanling, haven't you?

186
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,820
I've been hiding from someoneâ€”

187
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,390
Zhen Yu.

188
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Zhen Yu?

189
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,580
Zhen Yu has been searching for

190
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,900
three children with special fates.

191
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,860
10 years ago, he captured me

192
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,530
and forced me to find those three children by divination.

193
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,520
To stay alive,

194
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,780
I told him about two of them.

195
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,210
One was

196
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,420
in the Bai family

197
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,550
in Ning'an City,

198
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,880
and the other was

199
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,050
in the Bai Ze Clan.

200
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,260
So it was you

201
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,640
who brought Zhen Yu there.

202
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,460
I know I'm deeply sinful.

203
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,250
I've wronged the Bai family,

204
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,210
and I've wronged the Bai Ze Clan.

205
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,420
I've been racked with guilt.

206
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
But the guiltier I felt,

207
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,170
the harder it was to tell you the truth.

208
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,100
When Zhen Yu forced you to do the reading,

209
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,940
did you know what would happen afterward?

210
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,520
If I had known

211
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,400
that my divination

212
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,880
would bring so much bloodshed and suffering,

213
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,280
I would never have done it, even if it cost me my life.

214
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,050
But there are no "ifs" in this world.

215
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,790
What's done is done.

216
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,690
What's wrong is wrong.

217
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,300
It's all my fault.

218
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,960
Did you tell Zhen Yu

219
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,610
the whereabouts of the third child?

220
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,390
I didn't know why Zhen Yu was searching for

221
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,750
those three children,

222
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,720
but fearing he might succeed in his schemes,

223
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,290
I didn't continue the divination.

224
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,570
I lied to him and said that

225
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,090
the third child hadn't been born yet.

226
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,140
Zhen Yu,

227
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,040
that darn culprit.

228
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,790
It's him again.

229
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,200
Master.

230
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,250
How did this happen?

231
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,430
Weren't you just fine?

232
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,700
I'll give more spiritual power to you.

233
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,610
No, it's useless.

234
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,300
Luan Zhu injured my very foundation.

235
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,870
There's no saving me.

236
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,130
Take this.

237
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,560
It's my...

238
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,170
my turtle shell.

239
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Why are you giving this to me?

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,570
I don't want it.

241
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,530
I said take it, so take it!

242
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,600
You keep your own turtle shell!

243
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,630
This is the shell of a 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle.

244
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,480
Use it in medicine.

245
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,480
It might help you make the first-grade elixir.

246
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,700
Take it

247
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,160
and save the person you want to save.

248
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,140
Consider it a small act

249
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,340
of atonement from me.

250
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,090
Master.

251
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,340
I want you to live.

252
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,120
I don't allow you to die.

253
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,590
You're still willing to call me "Master."

254
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,070
Then even in death,

255
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,380
I'll have no regrets.

256
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,210
Do you remember,

257
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,960
when you were training with me in Lanling,

258
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,369
what I told you life was about?

259
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,119
Life is the journey

260
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,710
you start off with nothing

261
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,160
and end up with nothing.

262
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,619
In growing up,

263
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,010
you must learn to accept gains and losses.

264
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,710
I've always loved freedom.

265
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,819
Now,

266
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm finally free.

267
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,010
â™«The flowers flew awayâ™«

268
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,340
â™«My tears are streaming down like rainâ™«

269
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,400
Master.

270
00:17:52,750 --> 00:18:00,090
â™«Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the worldâ™«

271
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,230
Master!

272
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,850
â™«On the vast sea, you and Iâ™«

273
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,160
Master!

274
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,960
Master!

275
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,980
Let me borrow your turtle shell for a bit.

276
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,610
The shell of a 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle

277
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,780
can make divination more accurate.

278
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,500
After I die,

279
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,160
my shell

280
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,960
will be yours.

281
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,290
And when will that be?

282
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,460
Are you that eager for me to die?

283
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,930
Of course not!

284
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,630
I just think that a turtle like you

285
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,000
will probably live longer than me.

286
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,270
I can't really count on getting your shell.

287
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,770
Good that you know.

288
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,980
In the end, I still couldn't save Master.

289
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,910
You did your best.

290
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,440
I used to think

291
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,140
since Master was a Mystery Turtle of the Eternal Race,

292
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,340
he would live for a very, very long time.

293
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,650
I never thought he would leave me,

294
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,290
let alone so suddenly.

295
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,550
I used to pester him,

296
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,430
bicker with him,

297
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,820
and even steal his wine.

298
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,670
Back then, I thought

299
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,920
there was plenty of time ahead,

300
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,020
and I could make it up to him later.

301
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,720
But now that the unexpected happened,

302
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,780
I realized that the "plenty of time" I counted on

303
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,150
was never real.

304
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
So do whatever you want to do.

305
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,160
Don't wait.

306
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,160
Although Luan Zhu is dead,

307
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,270
many unanswered mysteries remain.

308
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,470
My parents' bodies still haven't been found.

309
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,730
You'll have to stay here a bit longer.

310
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,300
They're your parents,

311
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,170
trapped here by Luan Zhu for 10 years.

312
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,020
Of course, you must find them.

313
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,720
I'll be

314
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,850
wherever you are.

315
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,770
Shuo used to love looking at the starry sky.

316
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,390
I often looked at it with her.

317
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,070
You're so close to her now.

318
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,440
Unfortunately,

319
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,000
we can't go back to the past.

320
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,990
No matter what has happened,

321
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,300
you are still Bai Xi.

322
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,290
You have to face what you should.

323
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,410
Don't leave yourself with regrets.

324
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,380
Mother used to say

325
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,730
that after people die,

326
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,790
they become stars in the sky.

327
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,030
After Father and Mother passed away,

328
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,360
I often looked up at the stars,

329
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,960
trying to find where they were.

330
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,720
But I never looked for Xi's star...

331
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,350
â™«Don't linger, don't regretâ™«

332
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,920
because I always believed

333
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,740
â™«The last moonlightâ™«

334
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,710
she wasn't dead.

335
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,390
â™«The water from my hometown flows gentlyâ™«

336
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,190
â™«Sending me to the distant placeâ™«

337
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,890
â™«In this life, at this timeâ™«

338
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,120
Stop running away.

339
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,600
â™«I dare not look backâ™«

340
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,710
When we were little,

341
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,160
you always stood in front of me to protect me.

342
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,700
â™«Is there the same moonlightâ™«

343
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,680
I thought my sister was the bravest person

344
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,030
in the world, second only to Father.

345
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,930
â™«On your path?â™«

346
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,440
But why doesn't she

347
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,240
even have the courage to face me now?

348
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,800
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

349
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,470
â™«In the vast world, how can I get there?â™«

350
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,310
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

351
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,150
It's my fault that he died.

352
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,940
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

353
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,390
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

354
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,730
My hands are covered with blood, and I've done all the bad things.

355
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,550
I'm not worthy to be your sister.

356
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,900
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

357
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,450
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

358
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,590
I'm even less soâ€¦

359
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,310
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

360
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,160
to be his daughter.

361
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,460
â™«Time after timeâ™«

362
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
If Father were still here,

363
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,050
â™«Oh, melancholyâ™«

364
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,660
he'd just be happy that you're alive,

365
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,210
that you're safe and sound.

366
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,310
He would never blame you.

367
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,290
â™«Don't linger, don't regretâ™«

368
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,930
â™«The last moonlightâ™«

369
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,550
I promised Father

370
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,400
â™«The water from my hometown flows gentlyâ™«

371
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,540
that I'd find you.

372
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,200
Xi.

373
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,340
I've grown up.

374
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,210
â™«Sending me to the distant placeâ™«

375
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,420
I can protect you now.

376
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,960
â™«In this life, at this timeâ™«

377
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,530
Let me take you back and cure you of the poison.

378
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,090
Come home with me,

379
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,830
â™«I dare not look backâ™«

380
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,100
okay?

381
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,810
â™«Is there the same moonlightâ™«

382
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,030
Outside Ning'an City,

383
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,160
the hibiscus flowers you loved

384
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,030
â™«On your path?â™«

385
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,130
have bloomed season after season.

386
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,890
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

387
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,900
In the Governor's Mansion,

388
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,430
the cherry tree you planted

389
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,850
â™«In the vast world, how can I get there?â™«

390
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,200
has grown its rings year after year.

391
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,980
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

392
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,750
It's been 10 years.

393
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,230
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

394
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,880
It's time for you to come back.

395
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,890
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

396
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,810
Xi,

397
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,990
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

398
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,090
it's time to come home.

399
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,140
Let's go home,

400
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,760
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

401
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,260
okay?

402
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,620
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

403
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,060
â™«Time after timeâ™«

404
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,590
Shuo.

405
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,100
Shuo.

406
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,030
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

407
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,180
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

408
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,770
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

409
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,990
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

410
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,800
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

411
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,640
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

412
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,420
â™«Time after timeâ™«

413
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:47,190
â™«Oh, melancholyâ™«

414
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,930
Mystery Turtle said that Zhen Yu

415
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,030
was looking for three children with special fates.

416
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,310
Now it seems,

417
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,690
one is Fan Yue,

418
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,800
and one is Shuo.

419
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
Who is the third child?

420
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,020
Grand Master never mentioned it before.

421
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,280
Why did he

422
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,770
let you go so easily today?

423
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,060
You already went against his order

424
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,950
and saved me from the secret chamber.

425
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,780
Today, you pried into his secret,

426
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,810
yet he just accepted the excuse I made up and let you go.

427
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,610
I think he found something

428
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,840
in me.

429
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,220
And I've also felt

430
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,170
he has something

431
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,910
other than demonic power in him.

432
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,970
Something other than demonic power?

433
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,160
Zhen Yu injected demonic power into my body.

434
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,020
He wants me to completely become a demon!

435
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,860
The magics of Eternals and demons are incompatible.

436
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,580
Doing this

437
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,810
will only damage your foundation and make you die.

438
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,140
What exactly does Grand Master want to do?

439
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,480
Chong Zhao repeatedly defied Zhen Yu,

440
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,830
yet Zhen Yu didn't kill him.

441
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,430
But he injected demonic power into him.

442
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,600
Why was that?

443
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,850
Is Chong Zhao...

444
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,650
No, impossible.

445
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,130
I must be mistaken.

446
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,280
You're sitting here all alone.

447
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,880
What are you thinking about?

448
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,300
Nothing.

449
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,650
What's wrong?

450
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,990
Nothing.

451
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,420
Should we

452
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,640
go look for your parents' remains?

453
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,780
I was about to go.

454
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,750
I'll go with you.

455
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,740
Are you feeling better?

456
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,640
Don't worry. I'm not that fragile.

457
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,290
Let's go.

458
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,060
You haven't fully recovered yet.

459
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,120
Don't catch a cold.

460
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,720
I've imagined countless times

461
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,920
what it would be like to reunite with Xi.

462
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,770
But I never thought

463
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,390
it would happen right after Master's passing.

464
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,890
Life is truly

465
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,200
a mix of joy and sorrow,

466
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,160
full of unexpected changes.

467
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,260
No matter how much the world around you changes,

468
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,390
I'll always stay the same by your side.

469
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,820
To be honest,

470
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,770
I've had suspicions.

471
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,520
About what?

472
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520
Why did the Contemplation Stone enter my body?

473
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,280
Why am I the only one who can activate it and gather Contemplations?

474
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,270
And why does my blood have miraculous effects?

475
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,210
â™«The person standing far awayâ™«

476
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,370
I wondered if I might be special.

477
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,390
â™«Don't be afraidâ™«

478
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,280
Now, I finally have the answer.

479
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,280
â™«The stars will guide you to meâ™«

480
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,220
But the words "Xing Yue's Divine Mantle"

481
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,160
feel both so light

482
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,200
and so heavy.

483
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,730
â™«Walk towards meâ™«

484
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,420
What's worrying you, Shuo?

485
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,300
Xing Yue was a deity who saved the world,

486
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
but I'm just an ordinary human.

487
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,390
â™«My heart feels so...â™«

488
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
I don't know

489
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
what this Divine Mantle truly means.

490
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,790
â™«It's pounding as I wait for youâ™«

491
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,490
And

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,060
the story between Xing Yue and Jing Yuan

493
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,270
doesn't seem to have a happy ending.

494
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,510
You mean the part where Xing Yue killed Jing Yuan?

495
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,410
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

496
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,090
Don't take what Luan Zhu said to heart.

497
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,330
It's not because of what Luan Zhu said.

498
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,510
â™«You are my distant callâ™«

499
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
I saw it.

500
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,180
When I was in the sea of consciousness,

501
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,380
â™«You are my first and lastâ™«

502
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,270
some images flashed through my mind.

503
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,310
Xing Yue and Jing Yuan

504
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,740
weren't just lovers.

505
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,290
â™«My heart is trembling for youâ™«

506
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,520
Unfortunately, I couldn't see more.

507
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,560
â™«In this moment where we embrace each otherâ™«

508
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,490
That's all in the past.

509
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,460
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

510
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,840
This time, we've met again,

511
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,470
not as Xing Yue and Jing Yuan,

512
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,400
but as Bai Shuo and Fan Yue.

513
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,820
To me,

514
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,810
you're the best Bai Shuo,

515
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,250
the only one in this world,

516
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,840
irreplaceable.

517
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,730
There's one more thing.

518
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,760
The Contemplation Stone showed a prophetic vision,

519
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,070
which means the fifth Contemplation is in Bodhi Village.

520
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,420
Now that Luan Zhu is dead

521
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,220
and the villagers are gone,

522
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,120
it seems like everything has settled.

523
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,340
But why hasn't the fifth Contemplation appeared yet?

524
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,800
Let's just let it play out.

525
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,590
What's meant to happen will happen.

526
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,410
I didn't find anything.

527
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,490
Neither did I.

528
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,300
Mystery Turtle said the bodies in the cave weren't all of them,

529
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,470
but we've searched the entire village and found nothing.

530
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,580
Could it be

531
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,060
Luan Zhu destroyed them to cover her tracks?

532
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Luan Zhu cooperated with Jin Yao,

533
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,270
but it was purely for mutual benefit.

534
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,900
They must have had their own agendas.

535
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,750
Luan Zhu must have

536
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,570
kept something as leverage over Jin Yao,

537
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,630
and it might be related

538
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,250
to the Eternals who were killed.

539
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,200
You have a point.

540
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,120
In that case,

541
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,410
let's go search Luan Zhu's room.

542
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,810
There might be new clues.

543
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,270
Chong Zhao.

544
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,470
These

545
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,720
are tokens carried by Eternal disciples

546
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,320
as a form of identification.

547
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,870
[Chen Xuan] [Pei Yue]

548
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,430
[Meng Ning]

549
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,170
[Meng Ning] [Chong Tai]

550
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,330
Father.

551
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,110
[Meng Ning] [Chong Tai]

552
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,490
Mother.

553
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,150
The truth you've been looking for for 10 years

554
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,250
has finally

555
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,040
been uncovered today.

556
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,770
[Meng Ning] [Chong Tai]

557
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,920
Each of these tokens

558
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,340
represents a fallen Eternal.

559
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,380
These

560
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,770
are the evidence of Luan Zhu and Jin Yao's crimes.

561
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,770
My four uncles must still be kept in the dark by Jin Yao.

562
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,980
I need to return to Lanling

563
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,570
and tell them everything.

564
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,120
I'll go with you.

565
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,410
You haven't been cured of your poison yet,

566
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,160
and they don't know

567
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,420
you've already left Cold Spring Palace.

568
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,410
You've just reunited with Shuo.

569
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,340
Go back with them to Bright Moon Palace and wait for me there.

570
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,140
But...

571
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,040
Don't worry.

572
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,850
I'm Lanling's head disciple.

573
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,980
They'll believe me.

574
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,640
So Luan Zhu hid the Eternals' tokens here.

575
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,280
I really need to thank you two for helping me find them.

576
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,720
Where did Xi and Chong Zhao go?

577
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,270
They might have gone to look for

578
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,660
the remains of Chong Tai and Meng Ning.

579
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,750
Old Turtle said

580
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,830
that many Eternals' bodies

581
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,200
are still in Bodhi Village.

582
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,530
They're all evidence of Jin Yao's crimes.

583
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,990
Let's go help them.

584
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,380
I'll give these pills to Xi.

585
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,710
Once we're back at Bright Moon Palace,

586
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,840
I can definitely create the antidote.

587
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,300
Let's go.

588
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,090
What?

589
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,590
After just a few days apart,

590
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,150
you don't even want to call me Master anymore?

591
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,710
Did you really send them to Bodhi Village?

592
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,030
Yes.

593
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,260
Every Eternal on this wall

594
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,130
was personally sent here by me.

595
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,210
My parents were your closest friends.

596
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,500
Why did you kill them?

597
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,000
I gave them many chances.

598
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,260
Back then, Chong Tai and Meng Ning

599
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,910
accidentally noticed

600
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,430
the disappearances of some Eternals

601
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,450
and pursued the matter relentlessly.

602
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,450
I tried to stop them multiple times,

603
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,170
but they refused to give up.

604
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,870
Later,

605
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,780
they discovered my secret with Luan Zhu.

606
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,370
I never intended to take their lives,

607
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,750
but they were stubborn

608
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
and determined to stand against me.

609
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,590
Standing against me

610
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,920
can only lead to death.

611
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,990
My parents were loyal and kind their entire lives,

612
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,639
devoted to Lanling and caring for the people.

613
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,060
You were their most trusted senior.

614
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,460
How could you bring yourself to do it?

615
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,270
It was indeed difficult,

616
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,540
but your parents didn't know when to quit.

617
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,600
You really can't blame me.

618
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,330
Chong Zhao,

619
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,679
your parents' remains were destroyed back then.

620
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,699
You won't find them.

621
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,909
If you can forget everything that happened in Bodhi Village,

622
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,949
I'll spare your life.

623
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,480
Consider it my way of honoring

624
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,010
our master-disciple bond.

625
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,110
Whatever choice my parents made back then,

626
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,190
I'll make the same one now.

627
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,699
I won't compromise.

628
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,990
Jin Yao,

629
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,780
you conspired with Luan Zhu to kill your own kind.

630
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,900
What right do you have to call yourself Chong Zhao's master?

631
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,500
It's time to show the world

632
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,840
what a hypocrite you are.

633
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,990
There are precedents of humans turning into demons,

634
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,610
but you, when you were a mere human,

635
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,960
survived two of my strikes without dying.

636
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,550
That's something I still don't understand to this day.

637
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,640
Then, today,

638
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,360
take that question with you

639
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,990
and think about it on your way to hell.

640
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,990
You think you two alone can kill me?

641
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,370
What if they have my help?

642
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,110
Since you worked with Luan Zhu,

643
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,110
you should know that I'm here. How dare you still come?

644
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,000
After the fight with Luan Zhu,

645
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,260
you guys are either weakened or injured.

646
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,510
If I don't strike now, when else should I?

647
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,380
You caused my master's death?

648
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,070
Your master was really unlucky.

649
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,830
He discovered the secret between Luan Zhu and me.

650
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,960
He had lived for over 1,000 years.

651
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,030
That's long enough.

652
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,250
Chong Zhao has looked up to you as a father since he was a child,

653
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,780
revering and admiring you.

654
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,650
Yet you deceived him, betrayed him,

655
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,620
and made him mistake a foe for family for so many years.

656
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,500
Jin Yao,

657
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,710
you claim to uphold the duty of protecting all beings

658
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,440
and honor the responsibilities of the Eternals.

659
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,370
But in the shadows, you've slaughtered your own kind for selfish gain!

660
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Bai Shuo,

661
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,630
think back to

662
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,850
when you were weak

663
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,580
and had to watch helplessly

664
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,540
as Cold Spring Palace wreaked havoc on Ning'an City.

665
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,860
That feeling of powerlessnessâ€”

666
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,970
I've felt it too.

667
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,100
I once had a righteous heart.

668
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,340
But back then, in Lanling,

669
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,720
hierarchy was strict;

670
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,810
status was clearly defined.

671
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,290
I couldn't change it.

672
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,070
When the Demon Race invaded, killing at will,

673
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,840
I couldn't stop it either.

674
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,890
The only way out

675
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,840
was to become stronger.

676
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,810
Only by becoming stronger could I do what I wanted to do

677
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,690
and protect who I wanted to protect.

678
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,950
But in the process of becoming stronger,

679
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,310
my heart

680
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,940
has changed.

681
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,090
That's something you'll never understand.

682
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,820
Today, Lanling is the head

683
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,440
of all Eternal Sects.

684
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,110
To its disciples,

685
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,520
there is no longer oppression of rank or status.

686
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,230
To outsiders,

687
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,580
it's impenetrable, unmatched by any.

688
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,140
Isn't that all thanks to me?

689
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,160
Did I do wrong?

690
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,360
You did.

691
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,880
True strength

692
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,680
should come from one's own efforts,

693
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,310
not from achieving selfish goals

694
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,040
at the cost of countless lives.

695
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,390
Today, we'll seek justice for Chong Zhao's parents,

696
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,450
for my master,

697
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,540
and for the countless innocent souls in Bodhi Village.

698
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,310
Justice

699
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,730
has never been in words.

700
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,870
It lies only

701
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,670
in power.

702
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,720
How do you possess such strong spiritual power?

703
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,630
Did you really think the head of the Eternals

704
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,970
was only capable of this much?

705
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,840
During all these years of working with Luan Zhu,

706
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,160
I've learned many ancient mental cultivation methods of the Divine Race.

707
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,530
A century of cultivation

708
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,140
has made me who I am today.

709
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,900
Hiding my spiritual power

710
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,360
has been quite exhausting.

711
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,150
If you had such power,

712
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,840
why did you let me steal the Contemplation Stone back then?

713
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,700
As expected of the Master of Bright Moon,

714
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,570
you hit the nail on the head.

715
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,000
All these years, I couldn't figure out

716
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,330
how to activate the Contemplation Stone.

717
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,580
So I decided to play along,

718
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,190
deliberately letting you steal the Contemplation Stone.

719
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,340
I planned to wait until you gathered all Five Contemplations

720
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,020
before taking it back.

721
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,230
I didn't expect you to find Bai Shuo

722
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,960
who was capable of activating the Contemplation Stone so quickly.

723
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,900
But now, it seems

724
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,460
you'll never gather all the Contemplations.

725
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,880
Then,

726
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,710
return the Contemplation Stone

727
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,220
to me.

728
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,960
I underestimated you.

729
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,440
Take Bai Shuo and leave.

730
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,210
Don't burn your Star!

731
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,930
Burn his Star?

732
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,500
My dear disciple Chong Zhao

733
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,390
told me about the Seal

734
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,090
in a letter a long time ago.

735
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,370
Do you think I wouldn't be prepared?

736
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,080
Chong Zhao trusted you so deeply,

737
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,540
yet he's only a tool to you.

738
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,750
How despicable!

739
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,580
Luan Zhu once told me

740
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,180
that the Seven Stars Seal comes from practicing ancient demonic techniques.

741
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,630
And my spiritual power

742
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,240
comes from the ancient Heart Sutra.

743
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,520
Well, then,

744
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,340
let's see

745
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,070
if I can burn the last Star of yours.

746
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,220
No!

747
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,680
From this moment on,

748
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,840
the Master of Bright Moon no longer exists in this world.

749
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,540
Fan Yue!

750
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,450
Fan Yue!

751
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,840
â™«A lifetime of guarding everything with youâ™«

752
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,530
â™«Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vowâ™«

753
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,180
â™«I'll leap without a thought for tomorrowâ™«

754
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,220
â™«This moment feels like foreverâ™«

755
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,310
â™«I've missed too much time in my lifeâ™«

756
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,430
â™«I'll throw myself into this flame for youâ™«

757
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,620
â™«Even if I'll perishâ™«

758
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,400
â™«At least I can still kiss your faceâ™«

759
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,390
â™«Burn out my waning moonâ™«

760
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,340
It's your turn now.

761
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:41,110
â™«In exchange for a lifetime of passionâ™«

762
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,150
-No!
-Jin Yao!

763
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,010
The Hidden power?

764
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,370
You can actually control the Hidden power?

765
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,090
Who exactly are you?

766
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,030
Chong Zhao.

767
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,300
Chong Zhao!

768
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,900
Fan Yue.

769
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,910
Fan Yue.

770
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,560
Fan Yue!

771
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,190
Fan Yue!
