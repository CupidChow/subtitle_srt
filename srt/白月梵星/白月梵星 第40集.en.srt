1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimesâ€¦

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 40]

19
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
I just want to complete

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,980
what was left unfinished 60,000 years ago.

21
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,980
So, whether you are Xing Yue or not,

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
just for that face of yours,

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
I must marry you.

24
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,300
You have no choice.

25
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
Before I say yes,

26
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,570
I want a promise from you.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,590
Go ahead.

28
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,090
You must never harm any living being in this world again.

29
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,850
Since killing them is so easy for you,

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,890
why bother with such boring acts?

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,600
If you're negotiating with me as the wife

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,880
of the Hidden Lord,

33
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,100
I will comply with your terms.

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,820
Alright.

35
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,450
I promise you.

36
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,140
Tomorrow,

37
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,910
the Lunar Hidden Sea

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,290
will be our wedding venue.

39
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,180
The Lunar Hidden Sea has long disappeared.

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,940
60,000 years ago,

41
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,000
Jing Yuan could replicate Xing Yue Pavilion

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
for Xing Yue in the Demon Race's territory.

43
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,420
Likewise, here in the Eastern Continent,

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,880
I can replicate the Lunar Hidden Sea for you.

45
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,180
I want everything

46
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,490
to be exactly as it was 60,000 years ago.

47
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,390
Master,

48
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,579
Bai Shuo was right.

49
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,390
Everyone has their own responsibilities to fulfil.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,070
For the future of the Fox Clan,

51
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,990
Mu Jiu sacrificed himself;

52
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,170
To settle old grudges,

53
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,590
Cang Shan gave his life;

54
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,659
To protect the Polar Region,

55
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,530
you hurt yourself.

56
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,480
To protect the world, Bai Shuo bravely went

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,480
to face the danger.

58
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,010
And I...

59
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,240
have my own things to do.

60
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,510
This wedding gown

61
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,360
is exactly the same as the one from 60,000 years ago.

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,540
Try it on.

63
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,380
You'll wear it eventually.

64
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,700
Whether it's marrying you or taking control of the world,

65
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,210
I will reclaim everything I've lost.

66
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,940
Stop it.

67
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,960
What's the meaning of all this?

68
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,520
The meaning?

69
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,130
I'm the meaning of this world, aren't I?

70
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,840
If you keep being so arrogant,

71
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,840
you will never understand the true love and sincerity of this world.

72
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,080
Even if you possess 10,000 years of divine power,

73
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,590
it's all just emptiness.

74
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,750
Only the weak

75
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,159
chase after those meaningless meanings.

76
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,570
My Divine Mirror reflects all things.

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,090
It can also see all the evil thoughts in the world.

78
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,580
Whether it's Eternals,

79
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,050
demons, humans, or the Outlanders,

80
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,090
all beings

81
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,050
have their selfish and ugly sides.

82
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,220
It was like this 60,000 years ago,

83
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,580
and it will be the same 60,000 years later.

84
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,900
Time will not make it

85
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,240
any better.

86
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,070
Is this the meaning you want?

87
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,010
In this world, both good and evil exist.

88
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,060
Good has meaning

89
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,390
only in the face of evil.

90
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,640
I won't waste words with you.

91
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,510
After tomorrow's wedding,

92
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,730
you will be my Divine Queen.

93
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,910
All the good and evil in this world

94
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,330
will no longer have anything to do with you.

95
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,220
Don't struggle in vain.

96
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,800
You have lost all your five Contemplations and divine power,

97
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,980
leaving you weak.

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,170
You can't stir up any more trouble.

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,770
Tian Huo?

100
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,380
Master, you're awake.

101
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,410
Where is Bai Shuo?

102
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,810
Xing Yue Divine Arrow has been repaired.

103
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,610
How?

104
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,690
This time,

105
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,050
I didn't report to you in advance.

106
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,400
Will you blame me?

107
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,410
Tian Huo!

108
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,820
Tian Huo,

109
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,110
what's wrong with you?

110
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,320
Why do you have no spiritual power at all?

111
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,750
Back then,

112
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,390
when the first King of Outlanders

113
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,960
saw the remnants of the Divine Arrow,

114
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,160
he forged the Outlander King's Sword with his own blood.

115
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,720
For a thousand years,

116
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,400
only the Hua bloodline

117
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,780
could pull out the Outlander King's Sword

118
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,270
and infuse it with life.

119
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,990
Now that the Outlander King's Sword is broken,

120
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,230
I think

121
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,230
only the spiritual blood of the Hua bloodline

122
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,240
can restore the broken sword.

123
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,260
It's okay.

124
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,160
I... I'll save you.

125
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,990
Master,

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,710
don't waste your power.

127
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,280
This is my own choice.

128
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,510
I can save you.

129
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,620
Master,

130
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
it won't work.

131
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,000
It'll work! I can save you!

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,890
Master.

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,410
I also have my own mission.

134
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,920
As the Outlanders' princess,

135
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,920
I've been enjoying respect and honor since I was young,

136
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,890
but not once have I

137
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,780
shouldered the responsibilities that come with it.

138
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,480
This time,

139
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,690
I finally...

140
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,740
I finally did the right thing.

141
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,580
Bai Shuo...

142
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,720
She went to the Cold Spring Palace.

143
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,750
She didn't want me to tell you,

144
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,240
but I know that

145
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,450
if something were to happen to her,

146
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,960
it would be a regret

147
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,560
you would carry forever.

148
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,300
Master,

149
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,960
this journey

150
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,670
has been so difficult.

151
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,170
So many have already left us.

152
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,650
Take the Divine Arrow and save her now.

153
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,040
Don't leave any regrets.

154
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll leave these two

155
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,260
to you for safekeeping.

156
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,370
Don't be sad.

157
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,280
I am just...

158
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,850
going to find them.

159
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,960
In this life,

160
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,260
being able to follow you...

161
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,420
leaves me...

162
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,780
with no regrets.

163
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,510
â™«That year, that yearâ™«

164

â™«The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomedâ™«

165
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,390
â™«I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memoriesâ™«

â™«That year, that yearâ™«

168
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,230
â™«The flowers flew under the moon, filling the skyâ™«

169
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,000
â™«Falling to the mud, burying the memoriesâ™«

00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,830
â™«Layer after layerâ™«

â™«Another year passedâ™«

173
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,150
When the Heavenly Bell stops,

174
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,780
a grand ceremony should be held.

175
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,950
I've been waiting

176
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,590
for this couple's bow for 60,000 years.

177
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,980
The Purple Moon?

178
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,870
You have lost all your five Contemplations and divine power.

179
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,120
With such a mortal body,

180
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,410
why can you wield the Purple Lunar Power of Jing Yuan?

181
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,390
Because I have reestablished the divine pact with Fan Yue.

182
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,190
Of course, we can wield what belongs to each other.

183
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,230
Fan Yue,

184
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,280
forgive me for leaving alone.

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,720
But before I leave,

186
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,660
I need to borrow something from you.

187
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,730
You will support me,

188
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,520
right?

189
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,300
You should know

190
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,090
you're just a mortal now,

191
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,510
not a deity.

192
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,240
What you've been cultivating all along is Eternal magic.

193
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,470
Now, you've forcibly channeled demonic power into your body.

194
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,360
Even a deity

195
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,270
cannot merge Eternal power with demonic power.

196
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,930
From now on,

197
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,750
you will be tortured by the evil aura every day.

198
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,230
For those ants,

199
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,550
for killing me,

200
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,270
you've turned yourself into a creature

201
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,690
that is neither human, nor Eternal, nor demon.

202
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,210
Is it worth it?

203
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,010
I am not Xing Yue,

204
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,610
nor have I ever thought of becoming a deity.

205
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,000
I am not like her,

206
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,110
born to bring peace to the world.

207
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,580
What I've always wanted

208
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,930
was simply to protect

209
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,350
the people I love and cherish.

210
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,750
But now, the people I love and cherish

211
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,440
have all died or been hurt because of you.

212
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,270
If I don't kill you,

213
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,030
what meaning will my life have,

214
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,400
even if I live on in peace?

215
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,750
I will let you know

216
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,470
that the love and cherishing

217
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,070
you think you have

218
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,510
are all false!

219
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,010
I am the strongest in the world.

220
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,140
Even if I betray the world and kill everyone,

221
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,520
I still love you!

222
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,460
But why?

223
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,760
It has been 60,000 years,

224
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,270
and you've always treated my feelings like worthless trash

225
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,530
and never treasured it even for a moment!

226
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,560
Love is not just about receiving.

227
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,890
Love is also about sacrifice.

228
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,470
It's about giving.

229
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,570
But everything you do is murder and possession.

230
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,600
What you do is only to satisfy your own selfish desires.

231
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Mo Li,

232
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,440
you don't have a true heart,

233
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,290
and you don't know love.

234
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,600
If I can drag you and Hidden Heart to death with me,

235
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,790
then today,

236
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,450
even if I die here,

237
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,750
it would be worth it.

238
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,750
I did nothing wrong.

239
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,140
It's the world that is foolish.

240
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,319
Fan Yue?

241
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,890
You fixed the arrow?

242
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,190
Tian Huo did it.

243
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,510
She sacrificed herself to the arrow

244
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,870
and recasted it.

245
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,400
The Xing Yue Divine Bow has long been destroyed.

246
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,880
How did you find it?

247
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,680
The Divine Bow reappeared in the world

248
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
because of you.

249
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,320
Fu Ling is the bow spirit of the Divine Bow.

250
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,210
When she died,

251
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,250
the Divine Bow appeared.

252
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,440
No wonder she could hurt me.

253
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,870
Heaven,

254
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,860
you really are cunning.

255
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,670
You actually made the bow spirit of the Divine Bow fall in love with Chong Zhao.

256
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,300
You think that with such a bond,

257
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,850
you can stop me?

258
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,430
Dream on.

259
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,270
You keep saying

260
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,480
that I don't know love

261
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,650
and I deserve to die.

262
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,950
Today, I will let you see with your own eyes

263
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,420
how foolish so-called true love

264
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,920
and sacrifice are?

265
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,750
How could it be?

266
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,110
60,000 years ago,

267
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,740
I fell beneath the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

268
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,310
Do you think that after 60,000 years,

269
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,510
I still don't have a way

270
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,790
to deal with this one and only divine weapon

271
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,510
that could threaten me?

272
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,070
My Hidden power is even stronger than before.

273
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,920
And you are just a mortal.

274
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,770
The mere Xing Yue Divine Bow

275
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,670
can no longer hurt me.

276
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,610
Chong Zhao!

277
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,880
What are you doing?

278
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,340
Chong Zhao,

279
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,410
you actually managed to stop me from entering my sea of consciousness?

280
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,990
Shuo! Fan Yue!

281
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,660
It's Zhao.

282
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,030
Zhao, wake up!

283
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,310
You've always been arrogant and conceited,

284
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,380
which is why you forgot a saying in this world:

285
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,880
"Lie in wait to deceive the enemy,

286
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
store up strength to wait for the right moment."

287
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,080
I indeed can't kill you

288
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,680
and can't leave the sea of consciousness.

289
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,160
But if I exhaust my Eternal power,

290
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,570
I can still hold you off for a while.

291
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,650
Chong Zhao!

292
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,280
What are you doing?

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,810
Shuo,

294
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,510
I've survived this long

295
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,690
because Xi was still alive at that time.

296
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,720
I once had an unrealistic hope,

297
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,050
wanting to reclaim my body and be with her.

298
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,560
I know my death can only severely wound Mo Li

299
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,070
and can't kill him.

300
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,380
So after Xi died, I've been waiting.

301
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,400
â™«No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless onceâ™«

302
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
I've been waiting for a chance to give him a fatal blow.

303
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
Now, I've got it.

304
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,980
â™«Because love is thrillingâ™«

305
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,910
My death will be worth it.

306
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,120
â™«If you tear open my heartâ™«

307
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,050
Shuo,

308
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,070
Fan Yue,

309
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,990
don't show any mercy.

310
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,230
â™«I can hold you a little tighterâ™«

311
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,030
Remember,

312
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,710
kill Mo Li,

313
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,220
â™«This pain will gradually fadeâ™«

314
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,710
and save the world!

315
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,430
â™«Time withers the moonlightâ™«

316
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,390
â™«All that's left is pitch darknessâ™«

317
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,550
â™«I want to tear apartâ™«

318
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,230
â™«This sky for youâ™«

319
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,320
â™«A lifetime of guarding everything with youâ™«

320
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,340
â™«Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vowâ™«

321
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,450
Zhao!

322
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,130
â™«I'll leap without a thought for tomorrowâ™«

323
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,230
â™«This moment feels like foreverâ™«

324
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,510
â™«I've missed too much time in my lifeâ™«

325
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,370
â™«I'll throw myself into this flame for youâ™«

326
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,910
â™«Even if I'll perishâ™«

327
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,510
â™«At least I can still kiss your faceâ™«

328
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,220
â™«Burn out my waning moonâ™«

329
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,720
â™«In exchange for a lifetime of passionâ™«

330
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,310
Zhao.

331
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,720
Mo Li,

332
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,980
you've lost.

333
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,730
In the end,

334
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,300
sacrifice defeated your evil.

335
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,040
Do you think

336
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,030
I would die so easily?

337
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,590
Back then, even Xing Yue and Jing Yuan

338
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,650
couldn't destroy my Hidden Heart with the Xing Yue Bow.

339
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,070
Do you think you can do it?

340
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,270
Now, I've grown even stronger.

341
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,480
Chong Zhao is dead,

342
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,720
and this body is about to vanish.

343
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,840
Then I will use the power of the entire world

344
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,100
to rebuild my divine body!

345
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,810
The Hidden Heart?

346
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,050
Fan Yue!

347
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,920
Even if you use yourself as the vessel,

348
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,930
you still can't trap me!

349
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,300
For me,

350
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,590
nothing is impossible.

351
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,690
It's just

352
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,850
a matter of destroying both you and me!

353
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,230
Fan Yue!

354
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,430
What are you doing?

355
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,910
Stop it!

356
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,170
Shuo,

357
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,880
do you still remember

358
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,140
the promise you made to me

359
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
on the cliff in the Polar Region?

360
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,950
I'll take care of Bright Moon Palace for you.

361
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,860
I'll accompany Tian Huo.

362
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,690
I'll go and see

363
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,240
every mountain and river on the Eastern Continent,

364
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,280
guarding every star, sun, and moon.

365
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,450
I promise you.

366
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,860
You said

367
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,960
you'd never leave me alone again.

368
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,340
Let the calamity from 60,000 years ago

369
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,230
end today!

370
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,130
Don't leave this pain to future generations!

371
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,610
Fan Yue,

372
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,440
you can't trap me!

373
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,220
Do it, Shuo!

374
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,310
Release the true Xing Yue Arrow.

375
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,600
Let's put an end to all of this together!

376
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,770
You're asking me to send you to your death with my own hands.

377
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,270
I bear the Divine Mantle of the Demon Lord

378
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,690
and the responsibility for all living beings.

379
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,330
I'm willing to die.

380
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,660
It's not for the mission bestowed upon me by the Heaven,

381
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,210
but for you,

382
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,820
and for the countless living beings in this world!

383
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,970
I don't know what a deity should do.

384
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,850
But I know this is what I,

385
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,460
Fan Yue, the Demon King of the Polar Region, must do.

386
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:11,370
â™«If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowersâ™«

387
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,000
If the Hidden Heart reappears,

388
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,340
the Eastern Continent will definitely be destroyed!

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,820
â™«The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into placeâ™«

390
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,700
You know it.

391
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,070
It's the only way.

392
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,060
Draw your bow, Shuo!

393
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,020
â™«As the wind stirs, the clouds gatherâ™«

394
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,530
â™«As the clouds shift, the moon becomes fullâ™«

395
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:33,250
â™«Love is the hardest thing to understandâ™«

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,660
â™«I'm finally back to where it all startedâ™«

397
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,840
â™«All the answers are already explainedâ™«

398
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,490
â™«I'll owe you all of my lifeâ™«

399
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,610
â™«But we're destined to partâ™«

400
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,430
â™«How can I downplay this?â™«

401
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,970
â™«When you engrave your love into my heartâ™«

402
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,780
â™«When my star falls only for youâ™«

403
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,000
â™«When the heavens fallâ™«

404
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,340
â™«I can still connect with you through the waning moonâ™«

405
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,640
â™«When my pain blurs my eyesâ™«

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm willing to exchange my life

407
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,420
â™«Out of the countless stars, I see only youâ™«

408
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,400
for the peace...

409
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,830
of a city!

410
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,540
â™«As you turn into a falling starâ™«

411
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,480
The world is vast.

412
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,960
The journey ahead is long.

413
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,200
Promise me,

414
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,630
no matter what happens in the future,

415
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,220
you must continue

416
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,260
to live freely like now.

417
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,750
I hope Master lives a long life without worries,

418
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,300
that the Bright Moon Palace

419
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,820
is the best in the Demon Race,

420
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,780
that Cang Shan eats a lot every day,

421
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,330
and that Tian Huo lives with me happily.

422
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,350
Life is the process of going from having nothing

423
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,580
to having nothing again.

424
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,930
I've always loved freedom.

425
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,230
Now,

426
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,270
I'm finally free.

427
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,940
I'm like the morning light,

428
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,250
while you are like the stars.

429
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,860
The stars shine brightly

430
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
as the moon emerges from the clouds.

431
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,690
You must forever,

432
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,840
always...

433
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,660
be that unbreakable Bai Shuo.

434
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,340
I am just...

435
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,490
going to find them.

436
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,800
In this life,

437
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,560
being able to follow you...

438
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,250
leaves me...

439
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,090
with no regrets.

440
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,460
The sixth Contemplation,

441
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,590
the Contemplation of great love.

442
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,060
It's been 60,000 years,

443
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,040
Shuo.

444
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,160
So many deaths were the price

445
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,140
for this one chance to give him a fatal blow!

446
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,850
Don't waste their sacrifice!

447
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,920
Do it!

448
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,440
â™«Across thousands of milesâ™«

449
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,030
â™«The pain of parting lingersâ™«

450
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,780
â™« I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my daysâ™«

451
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,070
â™«Flowers in the wind, sand in the waterâ™«

452
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,160
Fan Yue.

453
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,260
â™«What kind of tree never takes root?â™«

454
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:31,320
â™«What kind of roots never turn into trees?â™«

455
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,490
It doesn't hurt.

456
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:41,290
â™«To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heartâ™«

457
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,070
How could you

458
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,180
make me make such a decision?

459
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,730
â™«I'm your wandererâ™«

460
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,600
The Shuo I know

461
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,700
â™«The flowers flew awayâ™«

462
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,400
is the bravest person in the world.

463
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980
In the future,

464
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,910
you'll live well, right?

465
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:03,590
â™«My tears are streaming down like rainâ™«

466
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:13,460
â™«Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the worldâ™«

467
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:20,260
â™«On the vast sea, you and Iâ™«

468
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,390
Are you leaving?

469
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,430
Shuo,

470
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,860
the wind is rising.

471
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,620
â™«The flowers flew awayâ™«

472
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,590
Shuo.

473
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,410
â™«My tears are streaming down like rainâ™«

474
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,220
I will always be with you.

475
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,860
I'll turn into stars,

476
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,510
into the sun and moon,

477
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:26,000
â™«Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the worldâ™«

478
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,870
into every breeze

479
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,670
that passes by your side,

480
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,050
â™«On the vast sea, you and Iâ™«

481
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,840
always staying with you.

482
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,790
Shuo.

483
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,270
I love you.

484
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,800
â™«May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?â™«

485
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,100
â™«Sadness from infatuation, anger, and partingâ™«

486
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,950
â™«My love brought tearsâ™«

487
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,920
â™«Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completenessâ™«

488
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,170
â™«I was never a flower, but I withered on my ownâ™«

489
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,800
â™«I fell between your brows and became a good fruitâ™«

490
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,690
â™«The grand dream of life is hard to let goâ™«

491
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,980
â™«Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothingâ™«

492
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,920
â™«With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessionsâ™«

493
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,820
â™«I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moonâ™«

494
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,200
â™«The daylight burns through, and the stars shine brightâ™«

495
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,090
â™«Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the skyâ™«

496
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,080
I used to think

497
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,670
that Jing Lei was impulsive

498
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,460
and always making noise in my ears.

499
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,430
Now that he's gone,

500
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,170
I find it a bit lonely.

501
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,570
I'm not used to it.

502
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,300
I'm still here.

503
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,350
Before, with Jing Lei around,

504
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,970
there was no chance for me to show myself.

505
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,960
As long as you like,

506
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,710
I can

507
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,440
chatter in your ear all day,

508
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,960
making it so noisy that you can't enjoy your food

509
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,880
or sleep at night.

510
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,160
Alright.

511
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,310
You two are now the two Sect Leaders

512
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,680
jointly in charge of Lanling.

513
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,940
It's inappropriate to bicker all day.

514
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,480
No, no.

515
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,400
From now on, there will be no Sect Leader in Lanling.

516
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,590
The three of us will supervise each other

517
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,910
and jointly protect the world.

518
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,370
That's true.

519
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,620
The key responsibility of the Eternals

520
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,810
lies in establishing the right way,

521
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,360
not in seeking power.

522
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,480
The Eternals finally found peace.

523
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,760
It's just a pity

524
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,880
that Chong Zhao will never come back.

525
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,230
Perhaps this is just how things are in the worldâ€”

526
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,630
rarely perfect.

527
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,540
In this turmoil of the Hidden Lord,

528
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,420
all the races worked together.

529
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:22,110
In fact, whether they are Eternals, demons, humans,

530
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,310
or Outlanders,

531
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,210
as long as they have a heart to protect all living beings,

532
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,810
they are our kindred spirits

533
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,540
and should be respected by Lanling.

534
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,380
But if you ask me,

535
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,760
the one who deserves respect the most

536
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,300
is Bai Shuo.

537
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,670
Over the past 60,000 years,

538
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,880
who would have thought that

539
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,020
a mortal could become a deity?

540
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,800
A deity

541
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,080
is not defined by how high one's spiritual power is

542
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,550
or by bloodlines,

543
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,070
but by

544
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,280
having a great heart full of love.

545
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,090
Although Bai Shuo inherited the Divine Mantle of Supreme Deity Xing Yue,

546
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,420
she did not become Supreme Deity Xing Yue.

547
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,280
Instead, with her own strength, she became Supreme Deity Bai Shuo

548
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,250
and forged

549
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,240
her own path.

550
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,050
[Tomb of My Father, Bai Xun]

551
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,860
[Tomb of My Father, Bai Xun]

552
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,410
Father,

553
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,810
I've come to see you.

554
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,700
This is a 50-year-old wine.

555
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,180
I took it from the wine cellar of the Unbridled Pavilion.

556
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,530
[Tomb of My Father, Bai Xun]

557
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
Let's try it together.

558
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,490
Father,

559
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,260
I miss you.

560
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,390
Good wine!

561
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,010
Little brat,

562
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,680
I'll drink with you.

563
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,440
Father.

564
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,010
I'm here.

565
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,400
I found Xi.

566
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,470
I know.

567
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,370
But I failed to protect her.

568
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,140
That was Xi's choice.

569
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,600
â™«Don't linger, don't regretâ™«

570
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
It's not your fault.

571
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,860
By the way,

572
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,890
â™«The last moonlightâ™«

573
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,780
you've been away from home for so long.

574
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,930
How is it?

575
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,430
â™«The water from my hometown flows gentlyâ™«

576
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,490
Have you become an Eternal?

577
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,870
You still remember that?

578
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,410
â™«Sending me to the distant placeâ™«

579
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,100
I was...

580
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,930
â™«In this life, at this timeâ™«

581
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,160
insincere and fell into demonic ways,

582
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,740
â™«I dare not look backâ™«

583
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
so I couldn't become an Eternal.

584
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,440
So be it.

585
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,890
â™«Is there the same moonlightâ™«

586
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,850
It's not a big deal.

587
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,690
Being a happy mortal

588
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,980
is also a good thing.

589
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,090
â™«On your path?â™«

590
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,650
Father,

591
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,090
I've seen the world

592
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,960
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

593
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,860
I once yearned for.

594
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,780
â™«In the vast world, how can I get there?â™«

595
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,140
Along the way,

596
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,770
I've loved,

597
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,540
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

598
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,520
and been loved.

599
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,830
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

600
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,200
But now they are all gone.

601
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,440
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

602
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,520
I've reached the pinnacle of this world,

603
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,420
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

604
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,640
becoming the strongest person in it.

605
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,930
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

606
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,250
But the price was too high.

607
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,640
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

608
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,000
If I could choose,

609
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,230
I would rather have never left

610
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,700
â™«Time after timeâ™«

611
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
this little Ning'an City.

612
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,650
â™«Oh, melancholyâ™«

613
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,190
I would rather just be Bai Shuo.

614
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,530
I've seen everything

615
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,300
you've been through.

616
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,410
Shuo,

617
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,880
you've done really well.

618
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,710
You must believe

619
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,850
that those who once stood by your side,

620
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,530
even though they've left,

621
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,190
will always stay in your heart.

622
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,130
Just like me,

623
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,240
though I've gone,

624
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,840
no matter when or where,

625
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,460
I'll always be with you.

626
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,520
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

627
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,190
â™«In the vast world, how can I get there?â™«

628
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,580
â™«In the chaotic night wind, the melody stoppedâ™«

629
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,580
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

630
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,430
â™«All the feelings turned into nothing but a dreamâ™«

631
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,450
Father,

632
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,140
don't worry.

633
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,580
â™«Reminiscing about the good old daysâ™«

634
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,700
I will walk

635
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,230
this path well.

636
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,150
â™«Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lostâ™«

637
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,870
â™«Forget all about the past and leave it behindâ™«

638
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,050
Have you understood?

639
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,290
Today, I am touched by your sincerity, as true as that

640
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,280
which can be witnessed by the sun and moon.

641
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,720
I can confidently tell you

642
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,020
the true identity of the guide.

643
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,350
Master Sun?

644
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,770
You are not a mortal.

645
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,400
Even I cannot see through your power.

646
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,650
Who exactly are you?

647
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,110
Who am I?

648
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,930
60,000 years ago,

649
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,440
on the Lunar Hidden Sea,

650
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
didn't you ask me the same question?

651
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,370
You are...

652
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,580
I am neither a being of this world

653
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,750
nor a deity of this world.

654
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,680
I have had many names,

655
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,930
but perhaps the one you're most familiar with

656
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,850
is Heaven.

657
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,380
Back when we were in Ning'an City,

658
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,010
you knew who I was?

659
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,320
That's right.

660
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,210
I knew that the Hidden Lord would return to the world,

661
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,030
and I knew you possessed the Divine Mantle of Supreme Deity Xing Yue.

662
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,060
So,

663
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,130
I guided you to meet the Demon Lord once again.

664
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,520
Since you've been here all along,

665
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,350
why didn't you kill Mo Li?

666
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,760
Why did you stand by and watch

667
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,820
so many sacrifices and departures happen?

668
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,530
Heaven is the law of this world

669
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,060
and cannot directly interfere in worldly matters.

670
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Even though I knew Mo Li's evil,

671
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,340
I couldn't completely erase him.

672
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,170
So I awakened you

673
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,820
to protect this world.

674
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,770
And in the end, you did it.

675
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,750
Bai Shuo,

676
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,450
you didn't become Xing Yue.

677
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,600
Instead, you became a deity with the body of a mortal,

678
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,020
the only exception in the world over the past ten thousand years.

679
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,090
You also proved to me

680
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,430
that Heaven

681
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,660
can be wrong too.

682
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,780
I once believed

683
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,670
that by forcing Xing Yue to have no love,

684
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,630
she would become the strongest

685
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
and could prevent the catastrophe.

686
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,590
But I failed.

687
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,320
Now, I see

688
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,640
a stronger power in you.

689
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,720
This power

690
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,930
is love,

691
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,560
sacrifice, and protection.

692
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,910
What's the point of telling me that Heaven

693
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,330
has made a mistake now?

694
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,250
Can you undo everything that has happened,

695
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,410
or bring back those who have already passed?

696
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,710
In this world, cause and effect,

697
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,440
good and evil, all have their due.

698
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,610
For love, one can die, but can also be reborn.

699
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,610
Those who died for the great cause

700
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,240
will eventually return

701
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,220
in another way.

702
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,010
Consider it Heaven's way

703
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,080
of compensating for the world.

704
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,310
Remember,

705
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,090
the essence of a deity

706
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,610
is in protection.

707
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,890
Only true and great love

708
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,140
can form an undying power,

709
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,130
crossing all boundaries,

710
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,160
overcoming all evil,

711
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,870
and forever existing with the world.

712
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,860
Shuo!

713
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,110
I'm back, Shuo.

714
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,130
â™«The person standing far awayâ™«

715
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,920
â™«Don't be afraidâ™«

716
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,220
â™«The stars will guide you to meâ™«

717
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:05,390
â™«Walk towards meâ™«

718
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,000
These days,

719
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,980
I have been to many places

720
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,000
to see

721
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,050
the magnificent sights you mentioned.

722
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,250
â™«My heart feels so...â™«

723
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,000
The sun, moon, stars,

724
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,530
â™«It's pounding as I wait for youâ™«

725
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,160
drifting clouds, and gentle breeze.

726
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,580
I saw everything as traces of you,

727
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,140
as if you were right by my side.

728
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,400
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

729
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,990
But you always came with the wind

730
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,000
and faded away with it.

731
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,390
â™«You are my distant callâ™«

732
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,340
I know

733
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,170
those were never truly you.

734
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,120
â™«You are my first and lastâ™«

735
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,300
Is the you

736
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,720
before me now real?

737
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:41,000
â™«My heart is trembling for youâ™«

738
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,400
Shuo,

739
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,900
this time, I'll give you the answer with my whole life.

740
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,400
â™«In this moment where we embrace each otherâ™«

741
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,040
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

742
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,760
Fan Yue,

743
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,210
the wind is rising.

744
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,170
It's not the wind.

745
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,970
It's my heartbeat.

746
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,410
â™«When you engrave your love into my heartâ™«

747
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,250
â™«When my star falls only for youâ™«

748
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,510
â™«When the heavens fallâ™«

749
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,810
â™«I can still connect with you through the waning moonâ™«

750
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,450
â™«When my pain blurs my eyesâ™«

751
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,230
â™«Out of the countless stars, I see only youâ™«

752
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:45,040
â™«As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heartâ™«

753
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,180
Fan Yue,

754
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,890
thank you for coming back.

755
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,510
[The End]
