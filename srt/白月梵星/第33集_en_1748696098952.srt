1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How old have you been living here?

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Consider yourselves all hardworking eons.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish I was as good as the stars and the moon.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only wish to see every star and moon with the one I love.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You are a traitor.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You have feelings for doesn't you?

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:51,860
You are so

13
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,100
forever

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,900
Nothing can uncomfortable

15
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,260
never become ruin

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,480
Yes

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,860
Ready

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,420

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,000

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Right

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:50,360

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
There's a war.

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
What's the matter?

27
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
The Soul Light!

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Let's go to the Soul Light room.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay, let's go.

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Impossible!

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Impossible!

32
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
The Soul Light of the Sect is gone!

33
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Impossible!

34
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
How could the Sect be like this?

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Who could kill the Sect Leader?

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
No, no, no, no, no!

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
It's just the Soul Light!

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
It must be the wrong one!

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
I don't believe it!

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I don't believe it!

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
The Soul Light is not fake.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
It's true.

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
If something really happened to Sect Leader,

44
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
he would be dead.

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
He would be dead.

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Nonsense!

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't believe it!

48
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Impossible!

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
The Soul Light of the Sect

50
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Why is it like this?

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
The Soul Light is gone.

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Why can't I save you?

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Fan Yuan, hold on.

54
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I will save you.

55
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
How is the Hall Leader?

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Prepare the Lian Dan Lu for me.

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Why can't I save him?

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Prepare the Lian Dan Lu for me.

59
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
If you don't go, I will go by myself.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Bai Shuang!

61
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
You said before you left,

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I would trust you with the Hall Leader's life.

63
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Then you must tell me what happened.

64
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Why is it like this?

65
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
You must bear the pain and ask for the blame.

66
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Let me go.

67
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Prepare the Lian Dan Lu.

68
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
I want to save him.

69
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Fan Yuan can't die.

70
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I will never let him die.

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Master,

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
you must protect me and make a list.

73
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
The Lian Dan Lu

74
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
The barrier is broken.

75
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
It seems that there is no one in Chong Zhao's body.

76
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
What happened?

77
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
The Shadow Power?

78
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Chong Zhao killed you.

79
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
It seems that your secret is not a secret anymore.

80
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
But you are dead.

81
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
You are dead.

82
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
You are dead.

83
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
But you are dead.

84
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
At least you proved your death.

85
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
The God will come back.

86
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Xinyi,

87
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,360
you can control the Night Mirror.

88
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Who are you?

89
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Chong Zhao.

90
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Chong Zhao, how are you?

91
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Master, you killed my master.

92
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Master, you killed my master.

93
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
It's okay. Don't panic.

94
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
We are no longer in the Bodhi Village.

95
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
We are in the Hall of Fame.

96
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
And Jin Yao is not your master.

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
She is your enemy.

98
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
She is the murderer of the Immortal Clan.

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
You killed her to save people.

100
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
You did not do anything wrong.

101
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
I called her Master of the Ten Years.

102
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I killed her personally.

103
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I know.

104
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
I killed her personally.

105
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I understand.

106
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I also called her Master of the Ten Years of Zhenyu.

107
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I saw the truth.

108
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Although it was painful,

109
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
it was not a good thing.

110
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
But in my opinion,

111
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
how could I kill Jin Yao?

112
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
I remember she mentioned the Immortal Power.

113
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
You once said that

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Zhenyu has the power to control the demon.

115
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
If I am not mistaken,

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
that is the Immortal Power.

117
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
She is not only the demon in your body,

118
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
but also the Immortal Power.

119
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
The Immortal Power was the power of the Sixth Year of the Sixth Year of the Immortal Clan.

120
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
She has already disappeared with the Immortal Power.

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Could it be that the Immortal Power

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
of Zhenyu Clan was the reason

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
why she used the Immortal Power to control me?

124
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Maybe.

125
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Oh, no.

126
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Jin Yao is dead.

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
She will die in the Soul Land.

128
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Lan Ling will be in the name of the Immortal Power.

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I must send Lan Ling

130
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
to destroy all of the Hong Kong.

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Otherwise, when the sect is established,

132
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Lan Ling will be in big trouble.

133
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Cheng Zhao,

134
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
I hope you are not the third child

135
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
that Zhenyu wants to find.

136
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I hope you have no relationship with Yin Zun.

137
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
ðŸ˜´

138
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Somehow I knew that you will fight for Lan Ling?

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Did you...

140
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
expected Sweet stove for the righteous man?

141
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Can they fight just like me?

142
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,040
MAMIRU

143
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,240
You thought you could be boleh de retire at the backyard of your house?

144
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,220
Is it worth your life and continue to persecut?

145
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Nobody can go yet?

146
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Why?

147
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Why still can't do it?

148
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Why still can't learn it?

149
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Ah Shuang, have a rest.

150
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
From now on, in Ning'en City,

151
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm a little old friend of mine.

152
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm doing my father's business,

153
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
doing my little smart things.

154
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I thought I was helpless,

155
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I thought I was the best person in the world.

156
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
But it turns out I'm not.

157
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Master gave me the turtle shell.

158
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I still can't learn a single bullet.

159
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
I can't save Fan Yuan and you.

160
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I really feel that I'm useless.

161
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
You, don't be too anxious,

162
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
and don't force yourself too much.

163
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
This single bullet has already been lost,

164
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
and you want to learn how to play it easily.

165
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Even if you fail, it's not your fault, okay?

166
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
No.

167
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I can't give up.

168
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Ah Xi, if I don't do my best,

169
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I won't save you and Fan Yuan.

170
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I'll hate myself for my whole life.

171
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
How is it?

172
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Did you find any news from the gate?

173
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I also sent my disciples to the place to investigate.

174
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
I didn't find any trace of the gate.

175
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I didn't find any news from the gate either.

176
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Why?

177
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Why did the gate of Tangtang Forest disappear without a trace?

178
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I never thought the gate would be like this.

179
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Someone must have secretly gone.

180
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
If I know who this person is,

181
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I'll definitely kill him.

182
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I remember that I went to find Chongzhao alone before the gate.

183
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I didn't know if he was there.

184
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I brought him back.

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I didn't even mention Chongzhao.

186
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Did something happen in the middle?

187
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
After Chongzhao left the Cold Palace,

188
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
he still contacted our senior brother.

189
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
We've never seen Chongzhao.

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
There was such a big thing in Lanling this time.

191
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
No matter what, we must get Chongzhao back.

192
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
At least, we must let him know that he's in trouble.

193
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Stop talking nonsense!

194
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Go find Chongzhao!

195
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Go!

196
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Go!

197
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Chongzhao!

198
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Chongzhao!

199
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
He's not here.

200
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
He's not in a good mood.

201
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
It means that Chongzhao has lived here for a long time.

202
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Come and see!

203
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,360
The Demon Flower Monk is from the Cold Palace.

204
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
There's a woman in this cabinet with a marital fragrance.

205
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Did he say that he lived here?

206
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Chongzhao is a stinky brat.

207
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
What's the situation with Chongzhao?

208
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
No matter what, we must find Chongzhao!

209
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I understand!

210
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,360
He came to the gate to hide the account of Chongzhao.

211
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Did he find Chongzhao?

212
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Why didn't he mention it?

213
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I always think that he's hiding something.

214
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
It seems that only after we find Chongzhao,

215
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
can we know what happened.

216
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
A-xi! A-xi!

217
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
How are you, A-xi?

218
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
It's okay.

219
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
It's okay. A-xi will surely show a form of weakness.

220
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
A-xi will surely save you.

221
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
No!

222
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
No! No!

223
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
It's a lotus-leaf-pickle.

224
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I've made it!

225
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
A flat-head!

226
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I've made it!

227
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
A-xi!

228
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
A-xi!

229
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
A-xi!

230
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
What I just spit out was poison.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I can't feel the pain in my body.

232
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
It's gone.

233
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Uncle,

234
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Chongzhao,

235
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
the poison in my heart

236
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
has been removed.

237
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
A-xi!

238
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
The Seven Stars of the Moon.

239
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It's a spell that's been practiced.

240
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
It's different from the Poison of the Heart.

241
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
If,

242
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
if this medicine pill can't be saved,

243
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
what should we do?

244
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I won't ask if,

245
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I just want to do my best to do what I can.

246
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I believe that it will wake up.

247
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
He said that

248
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
he would never be able to do anything.

249
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
He said that

250
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
he would never leave me.

251
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Maybe it's just a bottle of medicine pill.

252
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I'll keep practicing.

253
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,360
I believe that

254
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
the prayers of aggression

255
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,060
finally return all sanoAb

256
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,060
When all the answers are suffice

257
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,920
I heard from the demons

258
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,740
The arched demon in the east

259
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,920
Had changed the mystifying to shaman

260
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,000
So I decided to set mercy

261
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,020
The ventures

262
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,180
And Carnage

263
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,220
Theæ›¸ in the bottom road

264
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I was locked in jail.

265
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
I was always in the sea.

266
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Look.

267
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
There are still so many things waiting for you to deal with.

268
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,360
How can you be lazy?

269
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
The other monsters are waiting for you.

270
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm also waiting for you.

271
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I thought

272
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,360
as long as I remember the five years,

273
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I can save you.

274
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
But I thought

275
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
I could only be

276
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,360
for the sake of you.

277
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I hope

278
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
you can come back to me.

279
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Okay?

280
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Sanyue.

283
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
I've dreamed of you again.

284
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
When will you wake up?

285
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
What other way to wake you up?

286
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Uncle.

287
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Sanyue.

288
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
It's not me.

289
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Sanyue.

290
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Is it really you?

291
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
You're awake?

292
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
It's me, Uncle.

293
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm back.

294
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm back.

295
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
I thought you couldn't wake up.

296
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
It's all my fault.

297
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Don't cry.

298
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
So

299
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
you were cured by a single bullet.

300
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
I thought I was going to leave this time.

301
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
But you suddenly pulled me out of the valley.

302
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
You said so many things.

303
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
I can't bear to leave you.

304
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
I'm back.

305
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Since you're back,

306
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
since you can't bear to leave me,

307
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
then promise me

308
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
never to leave me, okay?

309
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Okay.

310
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I promise you.

311
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
I'll never leave you.

312
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Now,

313
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I should call you Bai Xi or Fulin.

314
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
The name is just a nickname.

315
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
You're the one.

316
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I wanted to kill you

317
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
when I met you.

318
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
But I never thought

319
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
I'd have a peaceful chat with you.

320
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
I thought

321
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
I'd only have one situation.

322
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
That's the Moon Palace.

323
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
What a coincidence.

324
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I thought

325
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
it was a peaceful chat.

326
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Tian Hong.

327
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm sorry

329
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
for Yicheng's matter,

330
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
and for the Hu tribe's matter.

331
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
I killed your beloved

332
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
before I killed you.

333
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
I'm sorry.

334
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
I killed your beloved.

335
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
It's better if you make a mistake.

336
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
So you're looking for me today

337
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
to beg for death?

338
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Not begging for death.

339
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
It's a punishment.

340
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
You think I won't kill you?

341
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I didn't tell anyone

342
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I'd ask you to meet here.

343
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
No one would know

344
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
you're a murderer.

345
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I didn't just want to kill you

346
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
on my own.

347
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
But now you're

348
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
trying to save Baishuo.

349
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Baishuo saved the Palace Master.

350
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
I'm her lover.

351
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I don't want her to be in trouble.

352
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
I don't want the Palace Master to be in trouble.

353
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Don't mention it again

354
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
if you don't want to.

355
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Why are you still standing there?

356
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Take back the dagger.

357
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Take back the dagger.

358
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Go away.

359
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
Go away.

360
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Go away.

361
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Go away.

362
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Go away.

363
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
No one would know

364
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
you're a murderer.

365
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
I didn't tell anyone

366
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
I'd ask you to meet here.

367
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
No one would know

368
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
you're a murderer.

369
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I didn't tell anyone

370
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
I gave it to you.

371
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Have you heard

372
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
about the way to remove the hidden power?

373
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
About the hidden power

374
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
I have to chase after the ancient god.

375
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
I know it's not more than you.

376
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Back then, Yin Zun tried to kill the world

377
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
to remove the hidden power

378
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
to save the world.

379
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Until today

380
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
all the tribes are still

381
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
trying to remove the hidden power.

382
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
So

383
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
the thing that caused the hidden power

384
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
is to keep it secret.

385
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Hang in there.

386
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Are you going to be like

387
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
the one who I've just met

388
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,160
That's a great achievement.

389
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
Where else would you go?

390
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
The unwavering King of the Demon Realm.

391
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,760
It's the first time we meet.

392
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,360
You still want to bite me?

393
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,160
At that time, the mountain was still there.

394
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,560
Later, we really met many people.

395
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,160
We went through many things.

396
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,360
There were the Dragon, the Fairy, the Wood-foot, and the Master.

397
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,760
Sometimes I wonder if I didn't want to be the Fairy,

398
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,360
and didn't want to go to the Five-Thousand-Thousand.

399
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,160
Then, will all of this not happen?

400
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,360
They won't either.

401
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,360
Uncle, we all have our own destiny.

402
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,760
Even if we don't meet you, some things will happen.

403
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
You have to believe in the people who left.

404
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,160
As long as we don't forget, they are not the real reason.

405
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Thank goodness you're still here.

406
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,360
Ashi and Chongzhao are also in the Hall of the Moon Palace.

407
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,760
Although Chongzhao has a shadow,

408
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,360
I believe that we can find a way to solve it.

409
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,960
Everything will develop in a good way.

410
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,360
Right?

411
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
It will.

412
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,560
You are now in the Five-Thousand-Thousand.

413
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,560
The Five-Thousand is also gradually opening up.

414
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
You will continue to become stronger and stronger.

415
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,760
After you become stronger, you may face new challenges.

416
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,960
But no matter what, you must always be the one who is willing to do anything.

417
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay.

418
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,760
It will be the anniversary of me and the Fire and the Sky Mountain

419
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,960
holding the Hall of the Moon Palace.

420
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,560
Every year, the anniversary will be clear and clear.

421
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,760
I will go and arrange it.

422
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,760
You are just in a good health. You should rest well.

423
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
This time, I will prepare.

424
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,760
You will be married and have a child. I will find Ashi.

425
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,160
I will bring everyone together to make a peaceful future.

426
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Do you know how to prepare the Demon Clan's Hall?

427
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,360
We will be together.

428
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,960
Anyway, you just wait. I will definitely give you the most unforgettable Hall.

429
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
I'm a little bit worried.

430
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,960
From the past, you are a fairy and the Demon Clan couldn't be two-handed.

431
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I am the Young Lord of the Cold Spring Palace and Fan Yue.

432
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,560
There is only one possibility. That is to make me die.

433
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,960
I didn't expect that the Hall of Moon Palace

434
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
is the only place that can protect us.

435
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,960
We will become one with Fan Yue.

436
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,960
From the past, my parents had a lot of friends and family.

437
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,560
I was very excited to see them.

438
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,960
We will become one with Fan Yue.

439
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,960
My parents taught me that

440
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,560
the Fairy Demon is not as powerful as fire.

441
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
But actually, you are the Demon.

442
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,760
I am the Fairy, but I have the Demon and the Silver.

443
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,360
Fan Yue is the Demon. She is the one who can protect us.

444
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Ashi is the one who can also fight against the Fairy Demon.

445
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,160
Actually, the Fairy Demon is not important.

446
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,760
The important thing is...

447
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,360
what we will choose to be.

448
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
It seems that you already have a point.

449
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,960
I know that you are worried about me.

450
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,160
But the thing that I am worried about is that I am afraid that I will be controlled by the power.

451
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,560
Don't worry. I will not be controlled by the power.

452
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,960
I don't know who I am going to do.

453
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,960
I know how to make Ziyang's path.

454
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,160
I won't let you down.

455
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Of course, I believe in you.

456
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,160
The red color that I know is righteous and righteous.

457
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,560
It is kind and not bad.

458
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,760
How could it be affected by your power?

459
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,360
Guess what I am thinking.

460
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,160
Mantou Poo.

461
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,360
I often think of when I was young, you taught me to be Mantou.

462
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,560
Cheng Zhang, I am a little miss the days when you were safe.

463
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,560
When everything is settled, I will take you home.

464
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,960
But Mantou Poo seems to be too annoying to us.

465
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,560
How many children do you think we have?

466
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,960
Two, right? One is like you.

467
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,560
Who is going to have a baby with you?

468
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Yes.

469
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
One is like you, one is like me.

470
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
You taught them to practice sword.

471
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
I...

472
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
I taught them to fight Mantou.

473
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Okay. I will teach them to practice sword.

474
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,960
You teach them to fight Mantou.

475
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Mantou Poo.

476
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Mantou Poo.

477
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Mantou Poo.

478
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Mantou Poo.

479
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,560
The flower of the Liao Yu in the 90's is in danger.

480
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,560
You are the god of the world.

481
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,560
You can use me to help you.

482
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,560
But you are not a living god.

483
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Master, your spirit is too strong.

484
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I didn't expect that even with the 90's talisman,

485
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,560
you can't repair it.

486
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,560
The way you talk is so good.

487
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I am not good at it.

488
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I am not good at it.

489
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
I am not good at it.

490
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
I am not good at it.

491
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I am not good at it.

492
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
I am not good at it.

493
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Turn left a little bit.

494
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Yes.

495
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Okay?

496
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,560
A little bit more to the right.

497
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Okay?

498
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
What are you looking at?

499
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I think it is almost the same.

500
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
It is not a flower.

501
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
But it is not loud enough.

502
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Go and move all the flowers in the back mountain.

503
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Go.

504
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Yes.

505
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,560
The god of the world is very good with me.

506
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
You are not good at it.

507
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
I am not good at it.

508
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
I have to do it myself.

509
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
I will do it myself.

510
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,560
I am willing to listen to you.

511
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Actually, I am the one who is willing to do it.

512
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Don't be so mean.

513
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
If you mess up the ceremony,

514
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
I will teach you.

515
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
You are right.

516
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Miss Bai,

517
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
you have to do the rose cake.

518
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Thank you.

519
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Stop working.

520
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I asked the chef to make the rose cake.

521
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Have a taste.

522
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
This morning,

523
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
the whole shop is full of your noise.

524
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
How big are you going to do it?

525
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
This is the first ceremony we have had together.

526
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Of course, it is very lively.

527
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
It is lively.

528
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
The first one?

529
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
You mean,

530
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
you want to celebrate the second and third time with me?

531
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
After this?

532
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Or else,

533
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
who else do you want to celebrate with?

534
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
No one.

535
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Only you.

536
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
It is almost the same.

537
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
I don't waste time with you.

538
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
I have to go to the village.

539
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
You have to rest well.

540
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Don't run around.

541
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
I know.

542
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Be careful.

543
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Be careful.

544
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Be careful.

545
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Be careful.

546
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Go ahead.

547
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
This way.

548
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Okay.

549
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
Almost.

550
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
It is so cold.

551
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
This is the first time

552
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
I have seen you like this.

553
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
It is the first time I have participated in the demon clan's engagement.

554
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Lengquan Palace has always been a good place.

555
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
There is no love.

556
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
And there is no love.

557
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I don't know how to explain it.

558
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Then let's have a good look at

559
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
the wedding ceremony tonight.

560
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
The wedding ceremony in the palace

561
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
in front of the palace

562
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
is taking place at the palace.

563
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
The wedding ceremony is taking place at the palace

564
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
and there is no love.

565
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
I am afraid tomorrow will be more difficult.

566
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
The wedding ceremony will be taken

567
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
by the young lady.

568
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Don't be afraid.

569
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
The wedding ceremony will be taken

570
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
by the young lady.

571
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
It is hot outside.

572
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Let's go together.

573
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
You just go out like this?

574
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Otherwise...

575
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Today is the big wedding in the store.

576
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
The queen of the demon king is the owner of the contract.

577
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Of course, it needs to be different.

578
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
How is it different?

579
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Look at me.

580
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
The new dress you're wearing

581
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
is more beautiful than mine.

582
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
I'm doing it on purpose.

583
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
I just want them to see

584
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
how beautiful my demon king is.

585
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Thank you.

586
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Znya.

587
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Znya

588
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
We will succeed.

589
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
We will succeed.

590
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
We will succeed!

591
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:47,880
the

592
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
What's going on?

593
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I'm dying.

594
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
I can't get this one.

595
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
No way.

596
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
I'll train you.

597
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Even without master's permission,

598
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
I can still train you.

599
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
My waist...

600
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
is crying.

601
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Where's your waist?

602
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
How could this happen?

603
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm willing to give god the chance to take us away.

604
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,880
I thought I could walk with you forever.

605
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm fine.

606
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I still can't change the ending.

607
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Don't say that.

608
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I don't want to hear it.

609
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
You promised me.

610
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
I've been by my side.

611
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
I told uncle.

612
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
I've been by your side.

613
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
Do you remember what I told you?

614
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,880
We all have our own destiny.

615
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
But what happened

616
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
will never be meaningless.

617
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I hope that if you were my destiny,

618
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
I wouldn't be destined

619
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,880
to meet someone like you.

620
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Because

621
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,880
I hope that I can meet uncle Pan.

622
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Uncle Pan is the happiest thing in my life.

623
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Promise me.

624
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Don't be sad.

625
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm sorry.

626
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,880
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

627
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

628
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Don't worry.

629
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'll be happy

630
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,880
to exchange this day with you.

631
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm your flower.

632
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,880
The one standing far away

633
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,880
Don't be afraid.

634
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,880
My heart will only smile at you.

635
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,880
Come on.

636
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Come on.

637
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,880
My heart is so excited.

638
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,880
I'm excited

639
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Wait for me

640
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,880
I'm sorry for your eyes

641
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,880
You are the light I want to forget

642
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
It's a lonely journey

643
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Let this moment be with you

644
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I want to be with you

645
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,880
I'm excited

646
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
Wait for me

647
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,880
You are the light I want to forget

648
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,880
It's a lonely journey

649
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Let this moment be with you

650
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:00,880
I want to be with you

651
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,880
I want to be with you
