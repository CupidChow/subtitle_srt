1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here is your cruel and crying tough world and you want to begin one day face to face!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:27,540
See you soon!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There is no going away from my heart.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No готов.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A любable star.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you, highly瀧雾.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,700
Then, let's, together

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,220
begin life in vain.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
De delegations party

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
來請 cups

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,260
應搞 Anne

19
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,140
May the world respect his wishes

20
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,560
All my people together

21
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,000
我也想告知何事

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,060
一個真相

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,940
你們一直想知道的

24
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,560
你們一直想知道的

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,940
子童少年的真相

26
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,180
the truth that you wereivercient

27
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,160
分享 musi

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:24,800
especially

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,420
you will倒

31

To theивалappand好好

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,260
since that�

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
I understood

34
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,720
my Sun

35
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,540
is no longer mine

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
The initial troubled 40 years

37
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,460
asidei Zitong

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,420
Kenn Gavin and others

39
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,920
have no fever

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,320
I told myself that I might have guessed it wrong.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,920
Maybe A Yue just accidentally gave birth to twins.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Later, A Yue and Qi Feng exchanged the same color.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,320
I was worried that something would happen, but I didn't do much.

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
A Yue! A Yue!

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
It's been another year.

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
A Yue went to the mountains to pick herbs.

47
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
He fell down the cliff.

48
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,320
A Yue! A Yue!

49
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
A Yue! A Yue!

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
A Yue! A Yue! I am A Yue!

51
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,320
It's time for the next one.

52
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Purple and dark? What is that?

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,120
That's the mark of the Demon God.

54
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,120
After the cliff, A Yue finally reached the Demon God.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
You mean, Fan Yue is the Demon God?

56
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
The God Clan has already disappeared.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
Why is the Demon God still in the Fan Yue body?

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,720
The God Clan has no other choice but to know.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,320
No matter what the reason behind it,

60
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,520
the Demon God is very grateful to the Bai Ze Clan.

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,120
My mission is to protect the Demon God.

62
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,520
The Hall Leader is going into the White Beast's consciousness.

63
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,120
I have been thinking these past few days.

64
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Why did he miss the time?

65
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
This time, he is still unconscious.

66
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,720
I want to talk to the spirit of the Bai Ze Clan.

67
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
The spirit of the Bai Ze Clan?

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,320
When the ancient times came, the ancestors of the Bai Ze Clan

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
were forced to be the Demon God.

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,920
They were also given the Demon God's power.

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Although the spirit of the Bai Ze Clan was already gone for thousands of years,

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,920
the spirit and the spirit of the Demon God are still stronger than the normal demons.

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,320
Otherwise, they will not be able to be destroyed for decades.

74
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,520
They will have to rely on the formation of the Ten Clan.

75
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,920
The Hall Leader meant that the spirit of the Bai Ze Clan

76
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,520
is now in the White Beast's consciousness

77
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
and has suppressed its will.

78
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
That's why it can't wake up.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
That's why I have to enter its consciousness

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,520
to change it.

81
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
No, Hall Leader. This is too dangerous.

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,720
The spirit of the Ten Clan is the weakest thing in the world.

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
Once the spirit is destroyed, it will be dead.

84
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
Even if the spirit of the Hall Leader is forced to enter the consciousness of others,

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
it will not be safe.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
It's not that. Your spirit is being swallowed.

87
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
It can't wake up anymore.

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
That's why you can't wait any longer.

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,120
But...

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
The Bai Ze Clan is my foundation.

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,320
I have to go to the place where I love.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,320
I know that I can't stop you.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,120
The spirit of the Demon God is in danger.

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,720
I will guard outside the room for you.

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,920
The Demon God

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Uncle Yang.

97
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Wait for me.

98
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
The Demon God

99
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
That's why when the Tiger Clan took the Purple-Tong Master,

100
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,720
you sacrificed Qi Feng to protect the Demon God.

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm sorry, Qi Feng.

102
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,520
But if I do it again,

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I will still make the same choice.

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,720
This is Qi Feng's mission.

105
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Bai Ze's mission.

106
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
When I entered the valley,

107
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
I felt a little strange.

108
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,920
The Bai Ze Clan is already a lady.

109
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Why is there still a strong fog in the valley?

110
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,120
It's been a long time since the day.

111
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,320
Now it seems that the fog is probably because of you.

112
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,920
It's because you still can't let go of your feelings.

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,320
That's why you have this long-awaited grudge.

114
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,920
I didn't regret what happened that year.

115
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
But I have a fault.

116
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,720
The two brothers who have taken this step today

117
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,320
were created by me.

118
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
That day,

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,920
it was my choice to change their original fate.

120
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,920
They have gone through different paths.

121
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,520
As the Bai Ze Clan leader, I can't regret.

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,520
But as their father,

123
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,920
I have two children.

124
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Especially Qi Feng.

125
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
The child who was born on the same day,

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,320
because he didn't have the God of Demon God,

127
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,520
he was destined to be sacrificed.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,920
If I were him,

129
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I would be very scared.

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,320
But Yue didn't make a mistake.

131
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
At that moment in Jiangsheng,

132
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,720
he was given the same choice

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,520
of the God of Demon God.

134
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,120
I hope that they hate me

135
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,920
and don't hate each other.

136
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,320
If Qi Feng can also hear what father said,

137
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Fan Yue.

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,920
Yue.

139
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,320
My inducement is over,

140
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,360
I've helpful,

141
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,960
I can do nothing.

142
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,500
He said he would return my promotion

143
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,500
I'll say it again! Give that child to Zitong!

144
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Qi Feng, you must remember that A Yue is not a man of your life.

145
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:44,500
He is not only your brother, but also the one you must protect with your life.

146
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I can help you, but I don't like the weak.

147
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:58,500
If you must use blood to remove the hatred in your heart and return to the Qi Feng of that year,

148
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I'll return my life to you when I'm done with what I have to do.

149
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I saw the mysterious face, but I saw a black snake-eared seal on his arm.

150
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,500
He was so selfish. He was so lucky to have a face like that.

151
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I know I can't beat you, but I know I might die here.

152
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
But the hatred of the Nian Clan is the enemy of the Sha Fu.

153
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The hatred of the Nian Clan is the enemy of the Nian Clan.

154
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
My father is not a good person, but he is a good father.

155
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
As a daughter, I can only do this.

156
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Since you are so painful, why do you still want to live?

157
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Forget it. Someone doesn't want me to kill them.

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I'll keep you alive today.

159
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
It's all my fault.

160
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
If I hadn't left the Bai Ze Clan,

161
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
the Qi Feng I met might have been the one who broke into the tribe.

162
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Qi Feng wouldn't have been so cruel and the Nian Clan wouldn't have been so willing.

163
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Don't put anything in your head.

164
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You've been tired for all these years.

165
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,500
You really think I'm a demon god? But I don't have any relationship.

166
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Sometimes, life is like this. It happens in a different way.

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,500
When it comes to the time, if there's no need, you have to be frank.

168
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You seem to know that.

169
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
That's why I have to establish a relationship with you.

170
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,500
The Bai Ze Clan is a god of the ancient god.

171
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Every tribe has the ability to predict the future.

172
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
The future?

173
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Not long ago, I predicted a message.

174
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
The world will be a better place for you to be.

175
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Replace you?

176
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Like you, I have a life.

177
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,500
But I don't know who he is and where he is.

178
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,500
The only thing I can confirm is that once I'm in the world,

179
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
the East Road will be destroyed.

180
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
What happened?

181
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Don't panic.

182
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Nothing happened.

183
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
It's just that time has come.

184
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
The Bai Ze Clan is a demon god.

185
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
The environment will be destroyed.

186
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,500
My tribe and I will leave.

187
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,500
A Yan, where are you going?

188
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
The Bai Ze Clan is from the world.

189
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
It's time to return to the world.

190
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,500
A Yan, don't be afraid.

191
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Don't be obsessed.

192
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You have your way.

193
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Don't be trapped in the past.

194
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Bai Ze Clan has one last gift for Shuo.

195
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
The blessing and the final gift of the Bai Ze Clan

196
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
will be given to you.

197
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

198
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I wish you a good fortune and good luck.

199
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

200
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I wish you a good fortune and good luck.

202
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

203
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

204
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

205
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
A Yan, you have to remember.

206
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Don't be trapped in the past.

207
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

208
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

209
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I wish you good luck and good luck.

210
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Let's go, Shuo.

211
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
We are going back.

212
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
We are going back.

213
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
We are going back.

214
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
We are going back.

215
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
We are going back.

216
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
We are going back.

217
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
We are going back.

218
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
We are going back.

219
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
We are going back.

220
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
We are going back.

221
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
We are going back.

222
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
We are going back.

223
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
We are going back.

224
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
We are going back.

225
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
We are going back.

226
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
We are going back.

227
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
What's wrong?

228
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Nothing.

229
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I just want to hug you and hug you.

230
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm afraid that I won't be able to hug you for the next life.

231
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I've never heard you say anything.

232
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,500
How about you say it again?

233
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm not joking with you.

234
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm not joking with you either.

235
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
You're a demon.

236
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Sometimes, you don't care about anything.

237
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
You're just like your eyes and ears.

238
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,500
You're just like your eyes and ears.

239
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
The demon is a god.

240
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
But who are you?

241
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
You're the one who changed.

242
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
What's wrong?

243
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
You want to drink with me?

244
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I just hope that you won't be forced to be a demon.

245
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
If the world is peaceful,

246
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
why not drink with me?

247
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
But if you're like what you said,

248
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
drinking and rich,

249
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
the world is a mess.

250
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Where can we hide?

251
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
San Yu, promise me.

252
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I promise you.

253
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
San Yu, promise me.

254
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
No matter what happens in the future,

255
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
we must face it together.

256
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Okay?

257
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Master.

258
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Come in.

259
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
What's the matter?

260
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm not seeing you.

261
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Greetings, master.

262
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
I'm Wu You.

263
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Master, I'm sorry.

264
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I was too careless.

265
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I didn't mean to kill you.

266
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm sorry for bringing you back to Bailu Lake.

267
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm sorry for your punishment.

268
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
You've been injured,

269
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
why are you back today?

270
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I was taken back to the good moon.

271
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I got a chance today.

272
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I escaped from the good moon.

273
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm free now.

274
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'll come back to see you.

275
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
He didn't kill you.

276
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
He just made you angry.

277
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
He wanted to use my body to get your power.

278
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
He didn't know the power of the Cold Spring Palace.

279
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I didn't betray him.

280
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I could have killed Fan Yue,

281
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
but I killed Cang Shan.

282
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
The wound on my body

283
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
is the two of Fan Yue's blood.

284
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
You killed Cang Shan?

285
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes.

286
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Good.

287
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
But you don't have to be so rude.

288
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You killed Cang Shan,

289
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
and you've broken Fan Yue's arm for me.

290
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
You've got the power.

291
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Get up.

292
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I'll get you back

293
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
for your injury.

294
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Thank you, master.

295
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
You're stupid.

296
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
You can't see me.

297
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You didn't get hurt.

298
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I just wanted to see

299
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
what you wanted to do.

300
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
But Chen Ye

301
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
saved your life.

302
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
You've grown up and got your waist.

303
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm curious

304
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
why you killed me.

305
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
You're a man.

306
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
You're a man.

307
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
You're a man.

308
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Why did you kill me?

309
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
You killed Hu Zun.

310
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
You're the one who killed the young man.

311
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
How did you know?

312
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You killed Hu Wangxia Ling

313
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
and killed him.

314
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
It seems that

315
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Hu Zun has a secret.

316
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Yes.

317
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I killed Hu Bai Ze.

318
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
What do you think?

319
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm not the one.

320
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
How can you have the success today?

321
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
It's not good to be a man

322
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
in the Cold Spring Palace.

323
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
The people of Bai Ze

324
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
deserve your sacrifice.

325
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
They're not the people.

326
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
You took me back to Bai Ze.

327
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You're so stupid.

328
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
You didn't save me.

329
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
It means you can't kill me.

330
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
But there's always a time

331
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
when I can kill you.

332
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I gave you everything.

333
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
You wanted to kill me, too.

334
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You're so good.

335
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
You've actually

336
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
put your poison

337
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
in my poison.

338
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
This is a great

339
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
gift from me.

340
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
But don't forget that

341
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm your master.

342
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Your poison won't hurt me.

343
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Kill me?

344
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Kill you?

345
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
That's too cheap.

346
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
I want to make it clear.

347
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Since you know

348
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I killed Bai Ze,

349
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
why didn't you

350
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,500
come with Fan Yue to kill me?

351
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
You came back to kill yourself.

352
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
You killed Cang Shan

353
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
with Fan Yue's letter.

354
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
How could he

355
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
keep you alive?

356
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
A'nuo,

357
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
why are you in the secret room?

358
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Where's Chen Ye?

359
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
You opened the secret room.

360
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
You wanted to kill him, didn't you?

361
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
He killed my father and my family.

362
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Your father and family

363
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
have other blood.

364
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
They killed them, too.

365
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
If you knew you'd kill them,

366
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
what's the point of your father

367
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
saving you?

368
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Chen Ye escaped from the prison

369
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
and seems to be in the Cold Palace.

370
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
He's still unwilling to go back.

371
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
He still chose to be loyal to me.

372
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
This is his own way of choosing.

373
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
You've done a good job.

374
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
What's wrong?

375
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
He forced your consciousness into the sea.

376
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I'm afraid it's a wound.

377
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
The White-Haired Team

378
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
The Purple-Haired Team

379
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
The White-Haired Team

380
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
The Purple-Haired Team

381
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
The White-Haired Team

382
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,500
The White-Haired Team

383
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Back then, the old man

384
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
was a child in the White-Haired Team

385
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
and a child in the White-Haired Team.

386
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
So I brought Qi Feng and Bai Xi back.

387
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
They were born to be children.

388
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
They were born to have a spirit.

389
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
When I was in the West,

390
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
I was taken to the King's Sword.

391
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I was looking for that child.

392
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Since Fulin found out,

393
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Chen Ye

394
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
had never felt a single thought

395
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
in my body for so many years.

396
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I was also looking for the wrong child.

397
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
But he was so pregnant.

398
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
What was Fan Yue and Chen Ye's relationship?

399
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Why did he let Chen Ye go?

400
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Is Fan Yue and Bai Ze

401
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
having any grudge?

402
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Could it be him?

403
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
The God of Light, stop it.

404
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Don't be so nervous.

405
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I just lost some spirit.

406
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll just pick some.

407
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I shouldn't have been worried

408
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
about the God of Demon, God of Power, Wu Bin and Heaven.

409
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Are you mad?

410
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
You know that the spirit will be damaged

411
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
if you break the bed.

412
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Why are you still doing this?

413
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
It's like you're worried about me.

414
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
I can't just watch you get hurt.

415
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Don't say it's a loss of spirit.

416
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Even if...

417
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Don't say it's a loss of spirit.

418
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Are you worried about something?

419
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Because of my God of Demon, God of Power?

420
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Uncle, I'm still Fan Yue.

421
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
There won't be any change.

422
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,500
But I'm really far away from the God of Power.

423
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I'm afraid that one day,

424
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
whether you're willing to or not,

425
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
you'll be the God of Demon again.

426
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I'm Fan Yue.

427
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
No one can change me,

428
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
including myself.

429
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Don't be afraid.

430
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
No matter what happens,

431
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm here.

432
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Can you stop being angry?

433
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Who said I'm not angry?

434
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Take the medicine.

435
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
The spirit hasn't recovered for a day.

436
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
The moon won't appear.

437
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
How is the owner?

438
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
He's fine.

439
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
I just gave him the medicine.

440
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
No matter who has the God of Demon,

441
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
he's Fan Yue in my heart.

442
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
He's the only one I can trust.

443
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
You've heard what I said to Fan Yue.

444
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
By the way,

445
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
I couldn't tell you when I came back.

446
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
The owner asked me to find out about Bai Xi's whereabouts.

447
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I found out that he was a Taoist who took Bai Jia away 10 years ago.

448
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
He might come from Lengquan Palace.

449
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I saw him in Chenye's memory.

450
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Zhenyu took Chenye away from Bai Zezu.

451
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
He thought he had the God of Demon.

452
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
But Bai Xi is just a human.

453
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Why did he take him away?

454
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Don't be impulsive.

455
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
We just know that

456
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Bai Xi has appeared in Lengquan Palace.

457
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
But I've never heard of such a good person

458
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
in Lengquan Palace for so many years.

459
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Zhenyu must have hidden him.

460
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
He couldn't find him in the past.

461
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Let's wait and see what happens.

462
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I didn't expect that

463
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Chenye Demon Lord, who is so unimaginable,

464
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
would have such a great time.

465
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I didn't expect that

466
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
the only person in Lengquan Palace who came to see me was you.

467
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
What?

468
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I didn't expect that

469
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
you would come to see me.

470
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
What?

471
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I didn't expect that

472
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
you would come to see me.

473
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
I didn't expect that

474
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
you would come to see me.

475
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
What?

476
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Why are you laughing at me?

477
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I can't say that.

478
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
After all, I've never been to this place.

479
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm just curious.

480
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
You always try to avoid

481
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
and kill him in the middle.

482
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
You think you can kill him?

483
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Don't you want him to die?

484
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
You just don't dare to do it.

485
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
What do you want?

486
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
My life is in his hands.

487
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I don't want to be judged.

488
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
What's the difference between me and him?

489
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,500
There are always things that are more important than life.

490
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
The person who was the one who killed Bai Ze

491
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
was Zhen Yu.

492
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
You killed Shizun to avenge you.

493
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Why did he do that?

494
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I don't know.

495
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I just know that he brought me back

496
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
because I had a child.

497
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Child?

498
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Why didn't I see him before?

499
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Because he used magic

500
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
to pull me out of the car.

501
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Only Zhen Yu could see me.

502
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Why did you remember Ah Xi?

503
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Why did he take Leng Quan to the palace?

504
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
What Ah Xi?

505
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Your Zhen Yu's private life

506
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
and the young girl in the palace.

507
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Where is she?

508
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Fulin, do you still remember your body?

509
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
What do you want to say?

510
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Zhen Yu is so annoying.

511
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
He's so angry.

512
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Since he's my disciple,

513
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I'm the one who's left behind.

514
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
What about you?

515
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
You're not the most talented

516
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,500
and the strongest in the world.

517
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Why did he keep you by his side?

518
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Don't you want to know

519
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
who you are

520
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
before you become Fulin?

521
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm not as good as you.

522
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Sometimes, the more people know,

523
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
the faster they die.

524
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Like you.

525
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
You're right.

526
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
You came here

527
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
not just to ask me

528
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
why I wanted to kill Zhen Yu.

529
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Is there any solution to the news?

530
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
No.

531
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
But I know where the solution is.

532
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
There's a secret

533
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
in the secret room.

534
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
The solution is in the basement.

535
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
You really want to tell me?

536
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
I think you're the same as me.

537
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
The same pit,

538
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
the same smile,

539
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
the same hate,

540
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
the same sadness.

541
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
The same love,

542
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
the same sorrow,

543
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
the same sorrow.

544
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
You and I are fighting in the cold spring palace.

545
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
We're rivals.

546
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
But we're also

547
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
the only companions.

548
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Whether you believe it or not,

549
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I've never thought about

550
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
marrying you.

551
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Fulin,

552
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
just live

553
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
if you can.

554
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Fulin!

555
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Fulin!

556
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
This is worth matching.

557
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
This isn't nothing.

558
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
It's just...

559
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,500
But my heart is suddenly a little bit broken.

560
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,500
You are now four years old and have the power of Bai Ze.

561
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
These powers can help you to become stronger.

562
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
But you also need to find a way to use them as a practice.

563
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Practice?

564
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
What is this place?

565
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
I was injured from leaving the Bai Ze Clan.

566
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I was practicing the Demon Clan's attack everywhere.

567
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I was thinking of revenge.

568
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Maybe it's the Heaven Realm.

569
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
I came to this cave accidentally.

570
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
There are many secrets in the cave.

571
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I practiced the Demon Power and the Demon Zeng.

572
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I practiced the Demon Zeng for three years and then I became the East.

573
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
There is nothing in this cave.

574
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Where are the secrets?

575
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,500
It's the secret that can make you become stronger and stronger in a short time.

576
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
The Demon Zeng

577
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Why did I touch the cave without any reaction?

578
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Is it only you who can make these patterns appear and disappear?

579
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
I also don't understand this.

580
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Maybe...

581
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Maybe the only explanation is that I have the Demon God's power.

582
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
This cave might be related to the Shen Clan.

583
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Shen Clan?

584
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
I was in a mess of practice and accidentally practiced the Seven Star Soul Shadow.

585
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
But I couldn't find the way to break it.

586
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Later, I saved my husband and got his supplement.

587
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Only the power of the Five-Ninus Stone can remove the Seven Star Soul Shadow.

588
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
But the Five-Ninus Stone is the God's.

589
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
No one knows its specific use in the world.

590
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I also got the Five-Ninus Stone's information in this mural.

591
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
What are you thinking about?

592
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Nothing.

593
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I just think that it seems that someone is signing the document secretly.

594
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Who asked you to come to this cave to get the Seven Star Soul Shadow?

595
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Then I arranged you to find the Five-Ninus Stone.

596
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:42,800
What kind of mission is the Demon God's

597
00:37:42,800 --> 00:38:02,600
meaning?

598
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm very confused.

599
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
You just met me, didn't you?

600
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
You are a pure white tree.

601
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Confused, arrogant, and bold.

602
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Everyone says that God is powerful.

603
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
But I have to make you a great god.

604
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm travelling through an endless journey,

605
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,840
inte sharpsho pretty calm

606
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,520
什么津波再次都不云不漫

607
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:49,160
Fuh

608
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
I won't let anyone disturb you.

609
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:31,600
The Demon Lord's Sword

610
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
The Demon Lord's Sword is ten thousand thousand.

611
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
You're not the highest of the gods,

612
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
nor the strongest.

613
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Why did he keep you by his side?

614
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
You're not curious.

615
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
You're becoming the most powerful.

616
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Who are you?

617
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
The Demon Lord is still in the city.

618
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
What is the Demon Lord's demon now?

619
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Master.

620
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
What?

621
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
You want to betray me?

622
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
I don't have the secret treasure.

623
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I just...

624
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I just want to see the Poison of the Heart.

625
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
When did you start to be the person

626
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
who gave me the Thunder and Thunder?

627
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
You're also the one who made me fall in love with you.

628
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I dare not.

629
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
You dare not?

630
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Didn't you go to see Chen Ye last night?

631
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I want to ask you.

632
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Do you still have family in this world?

633
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Who am I before I become the Poison of the Heart?

634
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
You want to know who you are?

635
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Poison Master,

636
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I've brought you back to the Cold Spring Palace

637
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
for ten years.

638
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,600
We have been trying for ten years.

639
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,600
I taught you before.

640
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
People should look forward.

641
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
The sooner they think about it, the sooner they die.

642
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
My Lady!

643
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Xixi!

644
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
My Lady!

645
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
My Lady, run!

646
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Let her go!

647
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Master, please!

648
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I beg you!

649
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I beg you to let Xixi go!

650
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
My Lady!

651
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Xixi!

652
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
My Lady!

653
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
No!

654
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Xixi!

655
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Come to me!

656
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
This suit is so nice.

657
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
I think this one is also very nice.

658
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Yes, it's very nice.

659
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Hurry up!

660
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Hurry up!

661
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Okay!

662
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
You are so ugly!

663
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
You are ugly too!

664
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Didn't you say you didn't want to come back with me?

665
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
We still have to wait for Xixi.

666
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
You can't do that!

667
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Father!

668
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
I am...

669
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
I am...

670
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I am not...

671
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I am not...

672
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
No, you are...

673
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
I am not...

674
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I am not...

675
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Since you already remember it,

676
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
why do you need to deny it?

677
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Am I right?

678
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
My good disciple,

679
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Bai Xixi.

680
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Back then, I sent people to take you away from Ning'an City.

681
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
And I erased your memory,

682
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
and turned you into a demon.

683
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Bai Xun was killed by you.

684
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
To tell you the truth,

685
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,600
all the hardships are in your hands.

686
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I am not Bai Xixi!

687
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
I can't!

688
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Since you are so painful,

689
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
why don't I help you to resolve this?

690
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Anyway,

691
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,600
the person I really want to find is never you.

692
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,600
The End

693
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,600
The End

694
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,600
The End

695
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,600
The End

696
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,600
The End
