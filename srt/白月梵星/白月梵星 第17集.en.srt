1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 17]

19
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
If we are going to talk, then let's set things straight.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,610
What's the point of leaving it unclear?

21
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,260
Fine.

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,840
Let's talk about

23
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,200
that Lanling Eternal of yours.

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,290
He went missing after

25
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,410
that fight in Outlanders' City.

26
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,350
And now, he suddenly appeared in the Fox Clan.

27
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,530
Where's your brain, Bai Shuo?

28
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,050
Don't you think there's something wrong with him?

29
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,950
What could be wrong with Chong Zhao?

30
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,710
He treats me

31
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,600
the same way you treat Tian Huo and Cang Shan.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
He has no intention to hurt anyone.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,110
But I won't go hugging Cang Shan.

34
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,490
You wouldn't turn a blind eye if Cang Shang was ever in trouble.

35
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,090
Now that something's up with Chong Zhao,

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,350
I was just comforting him.

37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,180
What's wrong with that?

38
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,810
Yes.

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,560
You did nothing wrong.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,470
Then why are you...

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,210
You two are childhood sweethearts.

42
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,150
If it weren't for the Contemplation Stone,

43
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,350
we wouldn't even stand a chance to meet.

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,380
So when I get the Weak Water Stone,

45
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
I'll give it to you

46
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,510
and we shall be considered even.

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,970
What did you say?

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,610
Since you want to call it even,

49
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,780
fine.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,630
The Weak Water Stone is meant to save my life.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,730
I am responsible for my own life,

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,300
so I’ll find it myself.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,610

Why are you wandering around here?

Auntie has agreed to our marriage.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,590
Come back with me.

60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,650
You came at the right time.

61
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,550
Mu Jiu,

62
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,310
you grew up in the Fox Clan.

63
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,180
Have you ever seen...

64
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,409
a tall, towering tree that eats humans?

65
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,630
A tree that eats humans?

66
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,070
How could there be such an evil thing in Jingyou Mountain?

67
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,370
But...

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,020
a tall, towering tree?

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,540
I actually do know one.

70
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,900
Is this the giant tree

71
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,120
you were talking about?

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,750
Yes.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,740
It's called the Emotion Tree.

74
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,290
You know that we Fox Clan practice curses, right?

75
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,970
The source of cursed power is from

76
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,100
the emotional vein within our bodies.

77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,230
When a newborn fox

78
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,880
receives blessings from the Emotion Tree,

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,290
the emotional vein will grow inside its body.

80
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,210
So this tree

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,050
is the foundation of our Fox Clan.

82
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,450
It's definitely not the man-eating tree you're looking for.

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Look at me.

84
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,740
Why?

85
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,520
Because the Emotion Tree can feel love.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,860
If love fills your heart as you look at me,

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,659
a single touch of the Emotion Tree

88
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,460
will make it bloom with flowers.

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Try it again.

90
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,000
That's lame.

91
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm not interested.

92
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,870
Let me try it then.

93
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,930
What's going on?

94
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,510
Why is there no response?

95
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,970
My aunt told me that when I was little.

96
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,310
There's no need to try.

97
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,780
Whether you like me or not

98
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,180
has nothing to do with me.

99
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,830
I need to find the tree that eats humans.

100
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,590
Goodbye.

101
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,690
No.

102
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,280
Wait!

103
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,030
Trust me.

104
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,210
I really like you.

105
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,040
This tree is old and useless.

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,690
Huo.

107
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,680
You can't believe that.

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,750
Huo!

109
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,500
The Emotion Tree of the Fox Clan?

110
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,120
That's just ridiculous.

111
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
Fu Ling.

112
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,390
Come here.

113
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,610
Mu Jiu was here with Tian Huo just now.

114
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,690
The Emotion Tree did not bewitch or attack them,

115
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,970
but it's attacking me.

116
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,070
Why?

117
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,790
Is it because...

118
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,950
I'm not from the Fox Clan?

119
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,870
Greetings, Master.

120
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,490
Are you...

121
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,630
Looking for Tian Huo?

122
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,260
According to the rules of the Fox Clan,

123
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,650
it's inauspicious for anyone

124
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,909
but the bride to touch the wedding dress.

125
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,549
This wedding dress

126
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,040
looks quite dated.

127
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,000
Was this what you wore when you got married back then?

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,850
Marriage is not in my destiny.

129
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,480
This was left behind by my sister.

130
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,030
It's the most important thing to me.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,970
Is your sister...

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
the legendary Saintess Ling Long?

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
How do you know Ling Long?

134
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,140
Because I know

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,130
you're Wu.

136
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,380
Ms. Bai, you actually know my childhood name?

137
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,930
Didn't Mu Jiu tell you?

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,020
When we were in Outlanders' City,

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,610
our group happened to find ourselves

140
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,880
in the realm of illusion that formed from the lingering resentment of

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,080
Kunlun's Mr. Rong Xian after his death.

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
We witnessed what happened between Saintess Ling Long

143
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,790
and Mr. Rong Xian,

144
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,950
as well as the tragedy back then.

145
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,330
In the realm of resentment,

146
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,610
the role I played

147
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,040
happened to be you, Wu.

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,610
I've seen

149
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,980
this earring before.

150
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,870
It's been a thousand years.

151
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,800
I didn't expect someone to mention

152
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,800
that scoundrel Rong Xian.

153
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,850
He even has the nerve to remember my sister?

154
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,050
My entire clan here at Jingyou Mountain was almost destroyed by him.

155
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,720
My sister's passionate love

156
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,030
ended in hatred.

157
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,360
In the end, she ended up dead with her soul completely obliterated.

158
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,180
But yet, there's still a wisp of his memory that continues to exist in this world.

159
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,680
How ridiculous!

160
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,830
Please calm down.

161
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,090
There's actually another truth behind what happened back then.

162
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,590
Mr. Rong Xian was also victimized by someone from Kunlun.

163
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,750
That’s why he made that big mistake.

164
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,120
He was truly wholehearted

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,150
towards Saintess Ling Long.

166
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,030
Ms. Bai.

167
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,120
Ultimately, this matter is a family affair of Jingyou Mountain.

168
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,340
What do you mean by meddling

169
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,950
and commenting so much?

170
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,780
I didn’t mean to.

172
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,700
It was simply that, by chance,

173
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,770
I learned some of the truth.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,390
I know it's one of your personal grudges.

175
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,720
That's why...

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,600
No need.

177
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,260
The deceased has passed away for a thousand years.

178
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,790
Why bring up the past again?

179
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,210
Could I trouble you to take this back to Tian Huo?

180
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,510
Consider it as a wedding gift to them

181
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,030
from me as their aunt.

182
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,020
Please.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,070
Master.

184
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,130
Master.

185
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,280
I need to talk to you.

186
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,550
Master.

187
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,120
Didn't you see that we have a guest?

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,900
Get out of here now!

189
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm here to report something to you.

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,050
That matter has been taken care of.

191
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,640
No one is discussing it anymore.

192
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,310
But I don't know for how long more

193
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,370
can we suppress it.

194
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,130
So please, Master,

195
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,120
make a decision quickly.

196
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,360
I’ll tell you one last time.

197
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,150
I will take care of that matter myself.

198
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,840
Get out!

199
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,340
Elder Chang Sheng!

200
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,440
Please wait.

201
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,490
I have something to ask.

202
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,740
You are just a brat from the Human Race.

203
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,280
If you have any questions, go and ask Master of Bright Moon.

204
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
I don’t have time for you.

205
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,390
I see that you are a man of character,

206
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,320
and is straightforward

207
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,470
and bold.

208
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,200
I wonder if you were the guard Ba,

209
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
who served beside the Master a thousand years ago?

210
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,930
You're not Ba?

211
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,530
Then, are you Qi?

212
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,770
I don't know who

213
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,790
these people are.

214
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm only 300 years old.

215
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,150
How could I know what happened a thousand years ago?

216
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,570
Only 300 years old?

217
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,030
So you wouldn't have experienced

218
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,590
what happened to Rong Xian and Ling Long a thousand years ago.

219
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,110
Then how did you become an Elder of the Fox Clan?

220
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,620
That scoundrel Rong Xian

221
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,980
almost wiped out

222
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,260
the entire Fox Clan a thousand years ago.

223
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,340
Those who fought

224
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,290
have almost all died in that battle.

225
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,100
If there was anyone else in the clan,

226
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,480
do you think I'd want to be stuck with

227
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,190
this unlucky position as an Elder?

228
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,290
Shoo, go away.

229
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,450
Don't get in the way of my work.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,450
In that realm of resentment,

231
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,880
Ling Long once said that

232
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,970
the guard, Ba, was easily irritable.

233
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,490
If it isn't Chang Sheng,

234
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,690
who else could it be?

235
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,940
Bai Shuo.

236
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,260
What does this person, Ba,

237
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,900
have anything to do with

238
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,190
what we're doing here?

239
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,490
Today, I noticed a scar on the back of Chang Mei's hand

240
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,320
that looks just like the ones you had.

241
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,360
That means,

242
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,080
if she wasn't the one who attacked you,

243
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,920
she would at least know who it was.

244
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,270
Does that make Chang Mei a bad person?

245
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,610
No, I must tell Master about this.

246
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,300
Stop!

247
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,370
Sit down.

248
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,880
Didn't I tell you?

249
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,790
The scene from the Contemplation Stone

250
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,440
suggests that Fan Yue will be in danger.

251
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,830
What we need to do now is to

252
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,850
find the Weak Water Stone with Fan Yue first.

253
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,580
We shouldn't get him involved.

254
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,140
Since when was I on your side?

255
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,280
Our common purpose

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,550
is to protect Fan Yue.

257
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,870
So why are we not on the same side?

258
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,100
Are you going to watch him get eaten up by that

259
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,960
strange tree, just like you were?

260
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,920
That kind of makes sense.

261
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,010
The Weak Water Stone is now in Chang Mei's hands.

262
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,440
If we want her to take it out,

263
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,100
we must fully understand her.

264
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,840
I thought resolving her grudge

265
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,100
regarding Ling Long's death would help.

266
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,900
I didn't expect her to react that strongly today.

267
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,580
Chang Mei also said

268
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,270
she isn't destined to be married.

269
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,550
But back then, the guard Qi

270
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,270
was clearly in love with Wu.

271
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,850
What happened

272
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,730
in the last thousand years?

273
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,150
Only by finding Ba can we uncover the truth.

274
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,510
What is this?

275
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,720
This is the wedding gift from Chang Mei

276
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,550
for Tian Huo and Mu Jiu.

277
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,050
I'd like you to take it to them for me.

278
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,770
What?

279
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,260
Tian Huo is going to marry Mu Jiu?

280
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,940
We've searched the entire Fox Clan today.

281
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,320
There's only one giant tree that matches Bai Shuo's description.

282
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,140
There must be something wrong with that Emotion Tree.

283
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,200
But when I was there with Mu Jiu today,

284
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,430
the tree was very quiet.

285
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,810
Nothing seemed strange.

286
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,410
We have no other clues now.

287
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,460
I'll go check it out again at night.

288
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,590
But Master,

289
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,090
your injuries...

290
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,780
How come you're starting to doubt me too?

291
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,650
Master.

292
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,390
I'm just worried.

293
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,610
I'm not doubting you.

294
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,120
I still have two stars out of my Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

295
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,050
It’s far from the end of the world.

296
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,140
Even if I'm injured,

297
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,770
no one can take my life.

298
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,910
Even if you don't die,

299
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,620
it doesn't mean you won't get hurt.

300
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,270
That's what Bai Shuo said.

301
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,310
What?

302
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,340
Why do I feel that

303
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,290
ever since Bai Shuo came to Bright Moon Palace,

304
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,170
both of you have become strange?

305
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,630
You wouldn't have said such things back in the Demon Race.

306
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,890
And there's Cang Shan.

307
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,510
As a demon, he couldn't even take a human away.

308
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,700
How ridiculous!

309
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,850
Not only we have changed,

310
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,690
you have changed too.

311
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,900
I’ve changed?

312
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,290
Previously, you were

313
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,620
only interested in investigating

314
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,290
the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

315
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,840
You stayed steadfast to your goal

316
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,410
no matter how hard things got.

317
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,860
But now, you would even

318
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,280
consider giving up collecting the Contemplations.

319
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,400
Isn't that change?

320
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,120
That's because...

321
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,780
Because you like Bai Shuo.

322
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,400
Because you like her,

323
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,050
her life is more important than yours

324
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,140
in your heart.

325
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,140
But Master,

326
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,930
I'm afraid that's what Bai Shuo thinks too.

327
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,460
Since you both care about each other,

328
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,950
you should take good care of yourselves.

329
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,690
Don't let her worry about you.

330
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,660
I understand.

331
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,490
When I get the Weak Water Stone,

332
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,880
I'll speak to her properly.

333
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,870
Do you like Mu Jiu?

334
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,200
That's how people are.

335
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,940
It's easy to perceive others,

336
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,970
but we remain blind when

337
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,570
reflecting upon ourselves.

338
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,400
The three of us have been together for years.

339
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,510
I also hope

340
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,530
you can let go of your grudges

341
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,400
and find someone you want to spend your life with.

342
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,320
Elder Chang Sheng has given orders to

343
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,160
search carefully as there have been signs of intruders

344
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,280
within the clan today.

345
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
Don't let anyone suspicious get away.

346
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,450
Yes.

347
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,310
You brought this on.

348
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,850
I happened to visit the forbidden area of the Fox Clan

349
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,400
and had accidentally made some moves.

350
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,930
That's what left the trail.

351
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,250
Jingyou Mountain is not a place for recklessness.

352
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,770
Please be careful.

353
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,820
If we fail the mission, we won't be able to answer to our master.

354
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,490
Don’t worry.

355
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,820
I've come up with a wonderful plan for you.

356
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,660
What do you want?

357
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm warning you.

358
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,480
Capturing Bai Shuo is my mission.

359
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,230
Don't worry.

360
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
I won't take your first credit from you.

361
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,260
The Emotion Tree of the Fox Clan will attack any foreign race.

362
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,609
Tonight, I'll lure Fan Yue to the Emotion Tree.

363
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,810
You take the chance to capture Bai Shuo.

364
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,569
Wait!

365
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,480
Who are you?

366
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,849
Catch her!

367
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,960
Hurry!

368
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,090
Catch her!

369
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,410
Stop!

370
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,590
Stop!

371
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,680
Auntie.

372
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,370
I've been busy since I came back,

373
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,960
and it slipped my mind to tell you.

374
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,460
Don't be mad at me.

375
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,180
I'll tell you everything

376
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,750
you want to know.

377
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,130
Forget it.

378
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,960
There's no point talking about the past.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
Let me just ask you one thing.

380
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,930
In the realm of resentment,

381
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,530
did you notice Ling Long and Rong Xian’s child?

382
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

383
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,530
Fan Yue changed the child's fate in the realm of resentment

384
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,440
by saving the foetus in Saintess Ling Long’s womb.

385
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,600
He was severely injured because of that.

386
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,610
But Auntie,

387
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,210
given that the realm of resentment

388
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,490
is not real,

389
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,300
will changing someone's fate inside

390
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,950
actually change reality?

391
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,060
I see.

392
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,650
It was Fan Yue.

393
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,690
Auntie?

394
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,130
Auntie!

395
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,890
I'm fine.

396
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,140
Jiu.

397
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,450
Did Tian Huo and the rest

398
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,620
ask you about the Weak Water Stone?

399
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,690
Yes.

400
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,360
But I don't know what that is.

401
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,860
I even asked around within the clan,

402
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,390
but no one seems to know of it.

403
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,280
Auntie.

404
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,480
Do you know what the Weak Water Stone is?

405
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,330
Jiu.

406
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,730
Listen to me.

407
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,540
You're going to marry Tian Huo tomorrow.

408
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,070
According to our clan's rules,

409
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,890
you shouldn't see each other before that.

410
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,960
Not just Tian Huo,

411
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,030
but also don't meet anyone from Bright Moon Palace either.

412
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,920
Why?

413
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,630
There's no such thing as why.

414
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,680
Anyway, if you want to leave the Fox Clan,

415
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,220
you must listen to me.

416
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,310
Auntie,

417
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,540
are you sick?

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,750
Tell me

419
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,770
if there's anything I can do for you.

420
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,210
I just have too much going on these days.

421
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,780
I'm tired.

422
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,340
You can leave now.

423
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,040
By the way,

424
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,850
ask Elder Chang Wu to come over.

425
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,460
Why is Auntie acting weird today?

426
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,480
You sly fox, you pretty boy!

427
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,200
Tell me.

428
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,380
How did you manage to fool Tian Huo?

429
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,690
What nonsense?

430
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,980
What's wrong with you?

431
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Huo.

432
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,130
Look at him.

433
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,970
He punched me without any reason.

434
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,270
At the very least, we've shared

435
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,610
meals and a roof back at Unbridled Pavilion.

436
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,480
You people from the Bright Moon Palace are so disloyal.

437
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,610
Look at his punches.

438
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,690
Nonsense!

439
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,110
It was you, with your slick words,

440
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,140
who tricked Tian Huo.

441
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,800
Otherwise, why would she marry you?

442
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,360
You!

443
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,130
Let go of her!

444
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,330
-Let go!
-Cang Shan.

445
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,570
You misunderstood.

446
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,550
It was my idea to get married.

447
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,530
What?

448
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,090
But...

449
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,060
it's just a fake marriage.

450
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,610
It has nothing to do with love.

451
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,340
It's simply a stopgap measure.

452
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,690
I knew it.

453
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,320
How could you like someone like him?

454
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,040
Still,

455
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,090
no matter the circumstances,

456
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,750
marriage isn't something to be taken lightly, right?

457
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,840
Why not?

458
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,620
Because...

459
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,480
Because marriage is a big deal...

460
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,340
Because marriage is a big deal, you need our master's approval.

461
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,300
In my opinion,

462
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
you need our permission to proceed.

463
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,520
Where'd you learn to say all of that, you silly rock?

464
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,270
Your master's approval?

465
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,190
In your opinion?

466
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,540
I think I understand now.

467
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,480
He's trying to take advantage of you

468
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,610
and wants to claim seniority over you.

469
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,890
Huo.

470
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,440
Cang Shan seems to...

471
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,500
He is just a friend.

472
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,760
Just friends?

473
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,650
Cold Spring Palace clearly doesn't disappoint.

474
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,960
You came all the way here to die.

475
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,160
She's gone this way!

476
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,950
Let’s go!

477
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,370
Elder Wu.

478
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,380
This is the residence of

479
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,810
the lady who was brought here by Master of Bright Moon.

480
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,810
Let's go and have a look regardless.

481
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,790
Elder Wu.

482
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,700
It's late. What's up?

483
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,610
Ms. Bai.

484
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,860
A few intruders broke into the forest.

485
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,760
Many of our clansmen

486
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,280
were injured by them by their demonic techniques.

487
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,150
A thief was seen heading towards your residence.

488
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,810
I wonder if you have seen them?

489
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,180
Miss?

490
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,600
I haven't seen them.

491
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,630
If you

492
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,850
see anyone suspicious,

493
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,000
you just have to shout for help.

494
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,830
Tonight, our clansmen

495
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,210
will be patrolling the forest.

496
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,540
I won't bother you then.

497
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,500
Let's go.

498
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,540
You hurt the Fox Clan's men?

499
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,170
You wouldn't hurt people for no reason.

500
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,980
So why?

501
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,970
Shuo.

502
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,210
There are many things I can't tell you now.

503
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,220
But trust me.

504
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,320
I have no ill intentions towards you.

505
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,400
While they are searching in the forest,

506
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,640
leave with me now.

507
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,490
I can't leave.

508
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,950
Because of Fan Yue?

509
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,670
He won't be able to control you anymore.

510
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,310
Tonight is a rare opportunity.

511
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,890
If you don't leave, you won't have any more chances.

512
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,160
You did something to Fan Yue,

513
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,890
didn't you?

514
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,750
Chong Zhao.

515
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,260
What are you hiding from me?

516
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,180
Are you trying to trick me a second time?

517
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,100
It's not me.

518
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,960
It's Fu Ling.

519
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,480
Cold Spring Palace wants to take you back.

520
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,940
Fu Ling has lured Fan Yue to the Emotion Tree.

521
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,000
That place is very strange.

522
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,190
She will definitely be able to stall Fan Yue.

523
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,340
If you don't leave now,

524
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,060
there's bound to be more trouble after this.

525
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,540
I'll send you back to Old Turtle. He'll protect you.

526
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,610
Fan Yue...

527
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,260
went to the Emotion Tree?

528
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,950
Fan Yue and I are companions.

529
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,680
Not to mention that he's in danger right now,

530
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,080
even if nothing happens tonight,

531
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,150
I never thought of leaving him behind.

532
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,480
I'll ask you about your affairs with

533
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,340
Cold Spring Palace when I'm back.

534
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,690
Fan Yue is a demon.

535
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,400
He's only interested in you because of the Contemplation Stone.

536
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,160
Shuo.

537
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,340
Why don't you understand?

538
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,910
In the beginning, perhaps.

539
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,260
But after what happened at Ning'an City, he has been treating me sincerely.

540
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,120
Instead, aren't you the one who has been hiding things from me,

541
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,780
refusing to tell me anything?

542
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,150
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

543
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,650
I'm not the old Bai Shuo anymore.

544
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,960
I won't trust others so easily.

545
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,470
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

546
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,550
Fan Yue may be a demon.

547
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
However, as a demon,

548
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,050
♫I remember that word of concern♫

549
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,540
he is better than any Eternal.

550
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,680
Chong Zhao.

551
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,390
Don’t let me down again.

552
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,920
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

553
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,160
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

554
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,630
Let go.

555
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,380
♫It dried in the wind♫

556
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,830
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

557
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,850
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

558
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,980
♫That year, that year♫

559
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,880
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

560
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,010
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

561
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,260
I must find a way to

562
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,210
get him closer to the Emotion Tree.

563
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,760
You came seeking for death,

564
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,760
and even found this tree for me.

565
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,500
Since you saved me from more hassle,

566
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,940
I will reward you by keeping your body intact later.

567
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,650
Thank you for your kindness, Master.

568
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,890
I just wonder

569
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,280
who will die tonight.

570
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,770
You've overestimated yourself.

571
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,460
The Emotion Tree won't attack the Fox Clan,

572
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,940
but it will devour you.

573
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm afraid you won't be able

574
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,500
to fulfil that favor today.

575
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,030
Stand up.

576
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,230
How could people from Cold Spring Palace end up here in Jingyou Mountain?

577
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,090
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

578
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,610
Many of the juniors had their tails cut off.

579
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,680
Given the demonic power in their wound,

580
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
who else could it have been

581
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,500
besides Cold Spring Palace's men?

582
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,650
Jingyou Mountain and Zhen Yu have been on good terms.

583
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,630
Why did he send someone to cause trouble suddenly?

584
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,090
It's for the Emotion Tree.

585
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,270
The people from Cold Spring Palace

586
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,270
have set their sights on our Emotion Tree?

587
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,240
Haven't you heard?

588
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,280
The Emotion Tree has gone awry.

589
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,370
Something is definitely wrong.

590
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,970
Yes.

591
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
-There must be something wrong.
-Yes.

592
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,310
Shut up!

593
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,750
Chang Wu.

594
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,920
Take the injured back to heal.

595
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,970
Chang Sheng.

596
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,290
Keep searching with your men.

597
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,020
Don't let anyone suspicious go.

598
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,670
Yes.

599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,800
Let's go.

600
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,460
Master.

601
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,860
Let me stay with you.

602
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,620
It's okay.

603
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,770
Just go.

604
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,740
Yes.

605
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,490
Ms. Bai, you seem to know

606
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,030
more than I thought.

607
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,970
I'm not the one you should be wary of,

608
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,300
but Cold Spring Palace.

609
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,650
Fu Ling is luring Fan Yue to the Emotion Tree.

610
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,700
No matter what their schemes are against Jingyou Mountain,

611
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,260
tonight, you and Fan Yue

612
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,290
should be allies.

613
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,370
How ridiculous.

614
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,520
Cold Spring Palace is targeting Fan Yue.

615
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,900
Now that Fan Yue is in trouble,

616
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,600
that has got nothing to do with me.

617
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,330
Master.

618
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,340
Yesterday, I told you about what happened inside Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

619
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,480
so you should have believed that

620
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,850
Fan Yue and I have no ill intentions towards Jingyou Mountain.

621
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,510
Just now, I heard your clansmen saying that

622
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,380
something is wrong with Emotion Tree.

623
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,920
If Cold Spring Palace finds out about this,

624
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,750
the Fox Clan will be in danger.

625
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
I ask that you please take me to the Emotion Tree.

626
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,170
As for all other matters,

627
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,500
I will handle it myself.

628
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,000
Fine.

629
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,400
I can take you there.

630
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,820
But remember,

631
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,000
you owe me a favor.

632
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,500
I can’t go near you,

633
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,870
but you can't come down either.

634
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,120
Any movement here

635
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,400
will alert the Fox Clan sooner or later.

636
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,700
Once Chang Mei arrives, you'll still die.

637
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,230
But you don't seem worried.

638
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,650
Unless your target...

639
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,940
wasn’t me from the beginning.

640
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,260
Fan Yue.

641
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,890
He...

642
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,200
is seeing an illusion?

643
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,550
This tree has such power.

644
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,650
Who could have thought Jingyou Mountain is hiding such a secret?

645
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,910
This Emotion Tree can create illusions,

646
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,430
devour and kill.

647
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,810
I could make use of it to kill someone on my behalf.

648
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,270
Besides getting rid of Fan Yue,

649
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,430
it's probably best to also destroy this Emotion Tree.

650
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,960
It would definitely be considered as a merit.

651
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,780
He had such a good opportunity,

652
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,510
but Chong Zhao still couldn’t take Bai Shuo away.

653
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,450
Fan Yue!

654
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,810
Stay away.

655
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,110
This is our clan's sacred tree.

656
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,970
Anyone not from the Fox Clan will be attacked if they get near.

657
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,580
Master.

658
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,810
Please release him.

659
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,260
Don't worry.

660
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,270
With his demonic power, he can still hold on.

661
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,590
It's not too late to let him out

662
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,990
after I deal with Fu Ling.

663
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,430
♫No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless once♫

664

665
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,000

666

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,740
♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

680
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,860
♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

681
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,160
♫Even if I'll perish♫

682
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,110
♫At least I can still kiss your face♫

683
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,130
♫Burn out my waning moon♫

684
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:03,770
♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

685
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,500
How are you?

686
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,410
It's not serious.

687
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,300
What about you?

688
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,370
Don't worry.

689
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,050
If you want to die,

690
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,950
I will definitely die before you.

691
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,200
How dare this Emotion Tree

692
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,550
covet my power?

693
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,510
I merely took advantage of the situation

694
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,860
to investigate what's inside.

695
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,490
Now, we can destroy it

696
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,410
to prevent future troubles.

697
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,590
The Emotion Tree is the foundation of Jingyou Mountain.

698
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,580
If it is destroyed,

699
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,770
I'm afraid Chang Mei won't give up easily.

700
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,590
By then, let alone the Weak Water Stone,

701
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,850
it'll be difficult to even leave safely.

702
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,360
This is indeed the place I saw.

703
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,950
You were also swallowed by the Emotion Tree.

704
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,020
The image from the Contemplation Stone has been fulfilled.

705
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,590
But why did nothing happen?

706
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,480
Be careful.

707
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,020
It's not a physical entity.

708
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,480
It should be a Tree Spirit.

709
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,350
It doesn't have enough power,

710
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,680
hence it doesn't possess a physical form.

711
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,980
It should be caused by your blood.

712
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,790
My people's years of cultivation

713
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,130
have been destroyed in your hands.

714
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,910
You people from Cold Spring Palace are really bold.

715
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,980
You and my master

716
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,070
have known each other for years.

717
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,540
Today, everything I have done

718
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,220
was targeted at Fan Yue.

719
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,080
If you kill me here,

720
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,190
aren't you afraid

721
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,110
that my master will come

722
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,590
and hold you accountable?

723
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,550
You're trying to threaten me with Zhen Yu?

724
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,310
Then let him come and collect your body himself.

725
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,150
The Emotion Tree has been revived?

726
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
Human blood?

727
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,950
Is it because of Bai Shuo's blood?

728
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,590
Tree Spirit?

729
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,480
How is that possible?

730
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,390
It's an Emotion Tree that eats people.

731
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,100
Every plant has its own soul,

732
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,830
just like animals and beasts.

733
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,240
Through virtue

734
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,270
and years of cultivation,

735
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,090
it has attained consciousness.

736
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,210
If it is not righteous,

737
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,430
gaining enlightenment by consuming human blood

738
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,500
is the evil path.

739
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,610
Even if the Emotion Tree has cultivated its spirit form,

740
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,340
it's probably something evil.

741
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,030
It shouldn't be the human form we saw last night.

742
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,930
Wait.

743
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,020
I used to think

744
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,550
Cang Shan and Tian Huo are about the same age.

745
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,250
But according to what you said,

746
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,080
the real nature of Cang Shan is a stone.

747
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,070
That means he must have been cultivating for

748
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,710
thousands of years in order to achieve a human form.

749
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,280
So, he's not even from the same generation as Tian Huo?

750
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,150
Bai Shuo, don't talk nonsense if you don't know anything.

751
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm from the Stone Race.

752
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,940
I was born with a human form.

753
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,840
It's different from the plants cultivating into a spirit form.

754
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,699
I'm about the same age as Tian Huo.

755
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,139
We are still young.

756
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,400
Why do you care so much about age?

757
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,219
That's not the point.

758
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,429
Right now,

759
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,360
this Emotion Tree on Jingyou Mountain

760
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,690
is hiding too many secrets.

761
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,570
When I was swallowed by the Emotion Tree,

762
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,820
I sensed a body under its roots.

763
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,639
There's spiritual energy emanating from the body.

764
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,389
It must have been a demon when it was alive.

765
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,469
Now the tree

766
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,239
has drained its spiritual energy and will wither soon.

767
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,710
Maybe, this tree has already died many years ago.

768
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,170
All these years, it has managed to stay alive

769
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,330
by devouring living things

770
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,429
and absorbing their spiritual energy.

771
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,650
In that case,

772
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,190
could the illusion you saw

773
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,100
be resentment left by the body under the tree,

774
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,760
just like Rong Xian's?

775
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I think...

776
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,210
I know who he is.

If we don't remove the residual poison,

785

it won't heal even with medicine.

you do care about what I think after all.

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,180
It was your plan to trap Fan Yue.

Ever since Ning'an City,

I've never hurt you.

is full of danger.

853
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,870
We can only rely on each other.

854
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,250
Bai Shuo is on Fan Yue’s side.

I only love Bai Shuo.

Apart from

866
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,350
saving you that one time at Ning'an City,

867
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,480
I've never done anything else for you.

868
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,520
You don't have to save me again and again.

869

Bai Shuo back all on his own.

905
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,480
Grand Master,

906
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,900
I ask that

907
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,820
we go together.

908
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,070
Do you care about Chong Zhao that much?

909
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,510
So much so that

910
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,890
you want to

911
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,200
disobey my order?

912
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,460
I just feel that

913
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,290
since we're all working for you,

914
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
we should

915
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,740
take care of each other.

916
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,270
Take care of each other?

917
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,730
Why didn't I realize that

918
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,250
you are this caring and loyal?

919
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,670
You may say you're taking care of him today.

920
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,930
Who knows if, someday,

921
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,650
you will betray me

922
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,400
for him?

923
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
I dare not.

924
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,070
If it weren't for you, Grand Master,

925
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,360
I would have been dead.

926
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,940
Grand Master, you've given me

927
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,220
a second chance at life.

928
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,440
I will never betray you

929
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,500
because of anyone.

930
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,670
You know

931
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,740
I hate disloyal people the most.

932
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,710
The bonds of family, friendship, and love

933
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,630
are nothing but

934
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,400
transient fantasies in this world.

935
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,860
Those who gave birth to you

936
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,440
hated you for being weak and sick,

937
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,220
and abandoned you

938
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,440
in the wilderness.

939
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,380
It was me

940
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,600
who took pity on you.

941
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,050
I brought you back to Cold Spring Palace

942
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,370
and raised you.

943
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,070
You were born useless.

944
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,190
You couldn't transform

945
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,580
or cultivate.

946
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,920
It's all thanks to

947
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,640
my efforts that

948
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,070
you have become

949
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,540
the person you are today.

950
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,450
I didn't invest so much in you

951
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,510
only for you to become

952
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,430
a lovesick fool.

953
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,510
Do you understand?

954
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,970
I will remember

955
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,590
all of your words

956
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,960
deep in my heart.

957
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,060
Rise.

958
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,550
You...

959
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,290
shall go with Chong Zhao.

960
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,000
But remember,

961
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,600
there's a price

962
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,860
to pay for everything.

963
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,870
If you can't

964
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,920
keep an eye on him and bring Bai Shuo back this time,

965
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,800
then

966
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,770
return me the life

967
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,350
I gave you.

968
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,670
Yes.

969
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,130
You want to protect her with your life,

970
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,480
but I also will protect you with my life.

971
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,170
Chong Zhao.

972
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,740
This world

973
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,850
is a funny place.

974
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,450
Wu.

975
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,070
You're slacking off again.

976
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,470
Ling Long will punish you

977
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,980
when she returns later.

978
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,460
Who?

979
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,850
Who's there?

980
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,660
Wu.

981
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,510
How could you forget about me?

982
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,040
Qi?

983
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,970
Qi!

984
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,650
Qi!

985
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,000
Okay, I got it.

986
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,880
You may leave if there's nothing else.

987
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

988
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,170
Ba.

989
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,910
Ms. Bai, what did you call me?

990
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,930
Ba.

991
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,660
Isn't that you?

992
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,550
I once entered Rong Xian's realm of resentment.

993
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,810
I saw what happened a thousand years ago.

994
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,700
I happen to recognize that Master

995
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,050
is the sister of Saintess Linglong, Wu.

996
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,740
Wu had two guards who followed

997
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
her closely,

998
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,250
namely Qi and Ba.

999
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,710
Qi and Wu fell in love.

1000
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,240
Now that we're in Jingyou Mountain,

1001
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,100
I didn't sense that Master was in a relationship with anyone.

1002
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,070
On the contrary,

1003
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,750
the grumpy guard Ba

1004
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,100
must be one of the two Elders.

1005
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,040
At first,

1006
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,780
I thought it was Elder Chang Sheng.

1007
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,970
But he denied it.

1008
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,040
You have a warm

1009
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,530
and welcoming disposition.

1010
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,320
Had I not witnessed Master's exceptional trust in you

1011
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,950
in the strange forest last night,

1012
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,840
I wouldn't dare make such a guess.

1013
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,790
Master.

1014
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,780
Let me stay with you.

1015
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,630
It's okay.

1016
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,730
Just go.

1017
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,880
Yes.

1018
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,740
It's been so long.

1019
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,310
Who would have thought

1020
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,400
someone like you would know about this.

1021
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,560
No one has

1022
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,000
called me by this name

1023
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,430
for many years.

1024
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,690
A thousand years is indeed a long time.

1025
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,390
The old members of the Fox Clan from back then

1026
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,720
have long since perished in that tragedy.

1027
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,920
I've previously heard that

1028
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,730
death is not scary.

1029
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,960
What's scary is that

1030
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,630
the last person who remembers you

1031
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,710
will also die,

1032
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,460
and there will be no trace left

1033
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,390
of the deceased's existence.

1034
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,320
Even if you almost forgot your name,

1035
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,200
you must still remember

1036
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,590
your brother.

1037
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,240
Is the body under the Emotion Tree

1038
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,670
that of Qi?

1039
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,550
How do you know?
