May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9

You and she are ultimately different.

Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16

[Cold Spring Palace, Demon Race]

20
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,520
You mean

21
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,220
a human

22
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,140
absorbed the Contemplation Stone into her body?

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,850
I saw it with my own eyes.

24
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,020
That Divinity from Lanling tried hard to get it out,

25
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,390
but he couldn't.

26
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
Grand Master,

27
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,030
the Master of Bright Moon Palace is in Ning'an City,

28
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,280
but he lets that human

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,010
come and go freely with the Contemplation Stone.

30
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,320
If they're not colluding,

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,060
it could only be that even Fan Yue

32
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,660
can't do anything about her.

33
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,450
Go bring that human back.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,650
Yes, Grand Master.

One more thing;

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
last night, I spread the Nether Poison in Ning'an City,

37
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,340
but it seems

38
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,900
it didn't work as expected.

39
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,970

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,660

the Lion Clan has been wiped out.

Their leader's inner core is here.

It can help you heal your wounds.

Please take a look.

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,910
Chen Ye,

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,870
well done!

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
You never left Cold Spring Palace

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
but could

51
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,640
win from thousands of miles away.

52
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,520
Impressive.

53
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,660
The Nether Poison was lost for many years.

54
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,130
I studied it for years

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,920
to bring it back into the world.

56
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,399
Lady Fu Ling,

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,920
if you want to know if it works,

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
why not ask me directly?

59
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,490
Then let me ask you.

60
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,480
The Nether Poison was released last night.

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,560
Why hasn't it taken effect yet?

62
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,850
Could it be

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,090
your years of hard work have failed?

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,270
Lady Fu Ling, do you think

65
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,670
it's effective now?

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,860
Noisy.

67
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,010
The Nether Poison is incurable.

68
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,060
Once poisoned, there is no escape.

69
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,920
He should thank you

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,560
for helping him find peace.

71
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,900
Since it works,

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,950
why hasn't anything happened in Ning'an City?

73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,250
Naturally, it's because I controlled the dosage.

74
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,640
In the dead of night,

75
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,160
the person lying next to you

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,190
is the one who brings your death.

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,080
Isn't that more interesting?

78
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,010

My Lord.

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,820
Interesting?

82
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,190
You're just venting from your boredom after being stuck in this palace

83
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,920
for too long!

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,510
After all, I'm not like you,

85
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,020
who have traveled far and wide

86
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
but still haven't

87
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,280
killed Fan Yue

88
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,860
for Grand Master.

89
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,370
You…

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,790
Alright, alright.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,950
You two

92
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,409
entered Cold Spring Palace at the same time

93
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,140
and grew up together.

94
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,560
Playful banter is fine,

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,110
but don't let it distract you from the important matters.

96
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,170
Yes, Grand Master.

97
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,300
I'll bring back Bai Shuo.

98
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,430
I'll never forget

99
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,600
your revenge, Grand Master.

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,790
Once the Nether Poison takes effect,

101
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,940
Fan Yue will be hunted by the whole Eternal Race

102
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,850
with no way out.

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Good.

104
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,160
You may leave.

105
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,680
Master.

106
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,820
What's it?

107
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,030
Last night,

108
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,880
there were other demons in the city.

109
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,830
Judging by how they did things,

110
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,590
they're from Cold Spring Palace.

111
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,700
Zhen Yu couldn't sit still any longer.

112
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,700
But I'm not sure if they're after the Contemplation Stone

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,030
or if they're after you.

114
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,450
It doesn't matter what they're after.

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,510
Five years ago, I cut off his tail.

116
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,970
If he dares to come again,

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,310
I'll cut off his head.

118
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,240
I've bought Father all his favorite food.

119
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,190
His birthday's in two days.

120
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,720
He'll definitely be happy.

121
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,610
Zhao?

122
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,230
Zhao?

123
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,250
What's wrong?

124
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,620
What's wrong with you?

125
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,480
You've been distracted today.

126
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,650
Making steamed buns last night tired you out?

127
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,500
There's something I can't figure out,

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,630
so I couldn't sleep.

129
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
What is it?

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,610
Tell me.

131
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,590
I'll help you think it through.

132
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,410
It's nothing,

133
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,640
just business stuff.

134
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,810
Listen,

135
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,290
don't overwork yourself.

136
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,870
Business is important,

137
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,490
but your health comes first.

138
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,980
Father is just like you.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,230
Once he gets caught up in work,

140
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,870
he stays up all night,

141
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,860
wearing himself out and ending up with health problems.

142
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,930
Zhao,

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,630
talk to him more

144
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,910
and ask him to sleep

145
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,000
and eat on time.

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,340
You've always cared about Uncle Bai.

147
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,370
Why don't you

148
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,260
say these things to him yourself?

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,770
If I talk to him myself,

150
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,300
we'll just end up arguing again.

151
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,710
He's more likely

152
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,380
to listen to you than to me.

153
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,970
When I'm not around,

154
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,590
please look after him for me.

155
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,040
Not around?

156
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,000
Where are you…

157
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,030
Don't bite me!

158
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,740
He looks familiar.

159
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,960
I made them take detoxifying pills that night.

160
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,220
How could this happen?

161
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,960
Take him away.

162
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,950
Move!

163
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,750
Bai Yu.

164
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,530
What's going on?

165
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,190
Lady Shuo.

166
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,070
Mr. Chong Zhao.

167
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,800
Last night, for some unknown reason,

168
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,070
some people in the city went mad.

169
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,750
Seven or eight of them

170
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,890
showed the exact same symptoms—

171
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,710
complete loss of sanity,

172
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,580
biting people all around.

173
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,510
Very dangerous.

174
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,710
What about my father?

175
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,330
He sent for doctors first thing this morning.

176
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,059
They're treating the sick now.

177
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,820
I have to go

178
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,860
make a patrol now.

179
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,120
Shuo,

180
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,440
I need to leave the city for a bit.

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,410
You go back first.

182
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,440
Suddenly?

183
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
I'll be back soon.

184
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,120
It's unsafe outside!

185
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,170
Be careful.

186
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,100
Physician Chen.

187
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,890
Governor.

188
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,040
Have you found a way to treat them?

189
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,330
We've practiced medicine for over a decade

190
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,450
but never seen a disease like this.

191
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,230
We really don't know how to treat it.

192
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,020
Then figure something out!

193
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,370
They must be cured!

194
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,400
This city must not

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,500
fall into chaos!

196
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

197
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,660
We'll do our best.

198
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,680
We'll do our best.

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Chong Zhao.

200
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,980
Chong Zhao.

201
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,440
Le Zhu.

202
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
There's no meeting today.

203
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,880
[Le Zhu, Eternal Race, Lanling Sect]

204
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,480
Why are you suddenly back?

205
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
I need to meet my master and uncles.

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,090
I don't think you should meet them now.

207
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,500
Why?

208
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,560
Well,

209
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,790
something happened.

210
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,050
What happened?

211
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,130
Last night, an Eternal Envoy sent a message

212
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,030
that a few Lanling disciples

213
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,840
were killed in the human realm.

214
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,660
Upon investigation,

215
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,210
they were killed by demons.

216
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,260
Who sent the demons?

217
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,740
We don't know yet.

218
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,990
Sect Leader, Feng Yu, and Yan Huo

219
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,390
have gone to find it out.

220
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,770
Yu Feng and Jing Lei were shocked and furious.

221
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,320
They're still angry right now.

222
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,720
If it's not urgent,

223
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,440
you'd better report it another time.

224
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,360
Well,

225
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,870
Yu Feng,

226
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,790
write it down for me.

227
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,940
Tomorrow, I'll go to the demons and…

228
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,100
Uncles.

229
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,670
Why are you back?

230
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,780
Has something happened in Ning'an City?

231
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,580
A few demons have caused a stir

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,540
in Ning'an City.

233
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,720
I was planning

234
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,610
to ask Master how we should handle it.

235
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,460
Demons again?

236
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,870
Demons broke the rules between the two races

237
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,160
and killed Eternals.

238
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,840
Chong Zhao.

239
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,260
Any demon who breaks the rules

240
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,820
must be severely punished.

241
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,960
Uncles,

242
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,710
there's one more thing I need to ask.

243
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,660
What is it?

244
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
The Contemplation Stone is somewhere out there.

245
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,380
If

246
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,790
it has chosen a master,

247
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,820
what should the Eternal Race do?

248
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,710
An ancient artifact that's been dormant for 60,000 years

249
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,650
has chosen a master?

250
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,780
Who could it choose?

251
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,850
Are you suggesting the Divine Race still exists?

252
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,490
What if

253
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,780
it did choose a master?

254
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,420
That's simple.

255
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,730
If it's an Eternal, they should be brought under our sect.

256
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,890
If it's a demon,

257
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,770
they should be killed on the spot.

258
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,370
And if it's a human?

259
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,780
Human? They don't have that kind of power.

260
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,040
Just saying, what if?

261
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,880
Humans can be easily controlled by demons.

262
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,640
A human with the Contemplation Stone

263
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,060
must be killed.

264
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,850
Stop.

265
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,510
If you break it again,

266
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,880
I won't have any pens left.

267
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,540
How many pens have you broken this month?

268
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,760
-Give it to me.
-Do you still have money to deduct?

269
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't grab me.

270
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,630
Stop breaking my pens.

271
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,390
Then I'll break your leg.

272
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,550
What did I owe you?

273
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,630
Why hasn't Father come back?

274
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,700
Has something happened?

275
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,600
Who are you?

276
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,160
A mere human

277
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,360
with an iron dagger,

278
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,140
and yet you think you can defend against me.

279
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
A human?

280
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,850
You're not human?

281
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,960
Since you know I'm not human,

282
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,530
I suggest you surrender

283
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,800
and come with me.

284
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,600
Go where?

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,050
You're asking too many questions.

286
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,980
Cloud Fire Arrows.

287
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,380
Fu Ling from Cold Spring Palace.

288
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,070
Who's she?

289
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,360
Someone after the Contemplation Stone.

290
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,270
Just like you?

291
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,690
What are you doing?

292
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,030
Leave now.

293
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,750
It's not my father's birthday yet.

294
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,410
If you don't leave, your death will come

295
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,210
before your father's birthday.

296
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,840
What do you mean by that?

297
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,920
Make it clear,

298
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,230
or I won't go with you.

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,960
She's having…

300
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,960
divine visions.

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,670
Young Lord!

302
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,050
Young Lord, how are you?

303
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,930
Young Lord.

304
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
You can't die, Young Lord.

305
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,240
What should I do if you die?

306
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,670
I'll take you back.

307
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,580
What should I do?

308
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,630
The fact that the Contemplation Stone is in Shuo

309
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,700
must not be discovered by the Eternals.

310
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,580
I need to find a way to take it out

311
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,010
before they find out.

312
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,350
Oh, no.

313
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,030
An Eternal is coming this way.

314
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,280
It's too late.

315
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,450
I can only hide her demon aura for now.

316
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,930
Miss.

317
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
What happened to you?

318
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,330
How did you get so badly injured?

319
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll take you to a physician first.

320
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,370
Excuse me.

321

[Jihuai Clinic]

She's gravely injured.

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,750
Please save her.

326
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,070
Her injury looks severe.

How is she?

The wound is severe,

330
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,530
but fortunately, her vital organs are unharmed.

331
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,070
That's a relief.

332

Here's the payment.

333

more important than your wife?

S-She's not my wife.

Whether she's your wife or not,

340

her wound is under her clothes.

341
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,070
I have to undress her to treat her.

If you leave her here alone,

343
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,110
her reputation may be stained.

How am I going to explain it then?

345

Hurry,

She needs to be treated immediately,

348
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,330
or she'll bleed to death.

349
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,550
Hurry.

350
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,450
Come with me.

351
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,530
The problem in the city hasn't been solved.

352
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,190
I can't stay here for too long.

353
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,390
[Unbridled Pavilion]

354
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,590
Why am I here?

355
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,530
The Contemplation Stone triggered divine power,

356
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,480
showing you things

357
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,280
that usually shouldn't be seen.

358
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,100
Tell me.

359
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,290
What did you see?

360
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,050
Move!

361
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,570
That's my family's abandoned courtyard.

362
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,100
Why are there so many mad people locked there?

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,490
I can't remember clearly.

364
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,500
Just blurry images

365
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,060
with a lot of people in them.

366
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Why did the Contemplation Stone

367
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,150
show me those things?

368
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,520
I've told you before,

369
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,200
to activate the Contemplation Stone,

370
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,120
one needs to gather the Five Contemplations.

371
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,070
As a divine object, it has its own mind.

372
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,420
What it showed you must be

373
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,550
the key to gathering Contemplations.

374
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,730
I'll stay here and watch you

375
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,920
until you recall everything clearly.

376
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,030
I can't remember it all at once.

377
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,230
Why don't you tell me first

378
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,170
if the visions the Stone showed me

379
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
are illusions

380
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,370
or reality?

381
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,820
Bai Shuo,

382
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,260
playing dumb won't do you any good.

383
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,420
You misunderstood.

384
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,400
I won't play dumb

385
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,960
when it comes to the Contemplation Stone.

386
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,420
I'm just a human.

387
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,970
How could I know the powers of a divine object?

388
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,260
What the Contemplation Stone shows

389
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,550
are things that haven't happened yet

390
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,610
but will surely happen in the future.

391
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,480
To obtain the Contemplations,

392
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,000
those things must happen exactly as shown.

393
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,700
Anyway,

394
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,710
you just need to recall what you saw.

395
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,190
I'll handle the rest.

396
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,470
Things that haven't happened yet

397
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,530
but will surely happen in the future?

398
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,570
Does that mean everything I saw

399
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,550
will happen?

400
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm not sure if he's a foe or a friend.

401
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,410
He may not genuinely want to help me.

402
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,340
I need to look into this myself.

403
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,810
My head really hurts.

404
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,750
The more you ask,

405
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,030
the worse it gets.

406
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,780
Let me go home to think about it.

407
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,530
Bai Shuo.

408
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,970
Those who deceive me

409
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,100
don't end well.

410
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,090
Don't worry.

411
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,990
There's something really important I haven't done.

412
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,290
I value my life very much.

413
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,890
If I remember anything,

414
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,940
I'll tell you.

415
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,820
Hurry.

416
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,170
Put them under control!

417
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,520
Open the door!

418
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,270
Move!

419
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,980
Move!

420
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,090
Master,

421
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,780
I followed Bai Shuo

422
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,260
and saw her go to an abandoned courtyard.

423
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,050
There were a lot of strange people locked up in there.

424
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,920
They seemed

425
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,580
to be poisoned with the Nether Poison.

426
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,080
Cold Spring Palace sent Fu Ling to capture Bai Shuo,

427
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,070
so the Nether Poison must be their doing too.

428
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,180
Then,

429
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,540
should we take Bai Shuo and leave the city?

430
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,860
No need.

431
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,530
The Contemplation Stone has shown Bai Shuo something,

432
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,330
and it's tied to those poisoned.

433
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,030
Whatever the first Contemplation is,

434
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,090
it's bound to show up in Ning'an City.

435
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,520
All we need to do

436
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,950
is wait.

437
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,910
Chong Zhao from Lanling Sect.

438
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,680
It's him.

439
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,870
Miss,

440
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,160
you're finally awake.

441
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,070
Where is he?

442
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,690
He?

443
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,400
You mean

444
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,550
the gentleman who brought you here yesterday?

445
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,860
He said he had urgent business

446
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,820
and left.

447
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,180
He's paid for your treatment.

448
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,910
Miss,

449
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,240
don't worry.

450
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,220
Your wound is quite deep.

451
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,370
You'll need plenty of time to recover.

452
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,370
So, it was you who treated me?

453
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
Yes, indeed.

454
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,550
Don't worry.

455
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,210
When I applied the medicine last night,

456
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,210
that gentleman was right beside me.

457
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,920
Even if anyone asks,

458
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,880
it won't affect your reputation.

459
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,590
Miss, remember to take your medicine.

460
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,790
Have a good rest.

461
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,910
It won't affect my reputation.

462
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,220
The dead don't talk.

463
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,980
I saw that scholar among the sick today.

464
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,800
It seems the visions from the Contemplation Stone

465
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,130
are indeed prophecies.

466
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,350
Fan Yue can't be trusted.

467
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,400
From the moment I met him,

468
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,040
nothing has gone smoothly.

469
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,030
I don't know if his story

470
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,920
about the benefactor is true or not.

471
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,380
I can't be sure that those mad people

472
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,910
have nothing to do with him.

473
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,860
If chaos breaks out in the city,

474
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,510
my father,

475
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,720
Zhao, and I will very likely die.

476
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,260
No.

477
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,760
I must find a way to get my father and Zhao out of here.

478
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,800
If we stay,

479
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,830
-we're all doomed.
-Hurry. Hurry.

480
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,830
Keep moving!

481
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,080
Fall in!

482
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,560
Are you ready?

483
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,360
Yes!

484
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,990
Father!

485
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,290
Bai Yu.

486
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,960
Go to the south of the city

487
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,280
and control the sick there.

488
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,800
Got it.

489
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,670
Father, listen to me.

490
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,930
Shuo, you listen to me.

491
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,650
Behind the hidden door in my room,

492
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,400
there are the valuables

493
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,530
I've saved over the years

494
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,200
and also some dowry your mother left for you.

495
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,110
Pack whatever is light,

496
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,000
find Zhao,

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,100
and leave the city tonight.

498
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,710
Father, what are you talking about?

499
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,840
-You...
-Governor!

500
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,460
Governor.

501
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,720
There are mad people in the west too.

502
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,460
Wang and the others can't hold on any longer.

503
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,310
Got it.

504
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,070
Wait for me outside.

505
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,830
Yes!

506
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,760
Shuo.

507
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,530
Remember,

508
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,160
leave before tonight.

509
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,480
There will be great chaos in the city.

510
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,010
Staying here is dangerous.

511
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,210
Father.

512
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,530
Father!

513
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,430
The demon poison in the city

514
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,500
is definitely related to Unbridled Pavilion.

515
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,230
I must get to the bottom of this.

516
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,040
My goods are great.

517
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,760
Stop hanging around outside.

518
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,130
Go home now.

519
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,000
What happened?

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,790
Something terrible happened in the south and the west of the city.

521
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,460
You've heard about the recent maniac condition, right?

522
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,530
It's already spreading through the south and west.

523
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,130
It's getting out of control!

524
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,830
This…

525
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,000
Who knows if those mad people

526
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,350
will show up here?

527
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,570
What should we do?

528
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,070
Go home.

529
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,200
Hurry up, go, go, go!

530
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,940
Young Lord.

531
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,360
I've done a great job, haven't I?

532
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
I even managed to fool that Eternal called Chong Zhao.

533
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,090
I didn't run away last night.

534
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,040
I went back to the palace to get medicine for you.

535
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,890
Here, take it.

536
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
You'll feel better after taking it.

537
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,400
Why aren't you speaking?

538
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,320
Don't you want to praise me?

539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,160
Grand Master always says

540
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,090
the Eternals can't amount to much.

541
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,900
Today, I finally understand.

542
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,260
Chong Zhao, the head disciple of Lanling,

543
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,610
couldn't recognize danger in the face of it.

544
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,640
He went through so much trouble

545
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
to save someone he barely knows.

546
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,560
How foolish.

547
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,120
Young Lord,

548
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,070
why do I feel like you're praising him?

549
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,030
Praising?

550
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

551
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,670
My wound hasn't healed yet, but I still have things to do.

552
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,350
I need to borrow your demonic power.

553
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,200
How much do you need?

554
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
All of it.

555
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,360
Then be careful not to drain it.

556
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,720
Boys, be careful.

557
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,680
Don't hurt anyone!

558
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,590
Yes!

559
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,110
Governor!

560
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,040
Father!

561
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,340
The master the Contemplation Stone chose.

562
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,210
Bai Shuo,

563
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,610
I'm curious to see

564
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,190
what makes you so special.

565
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,800
Don't hurt them!

566
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,590
You demon,

567
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,270
how dare you cause havoc here?

568
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,350
It's you.

569
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,170
I should thank you

570
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,770
for your kind help

571
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,980
in saving my life.

572
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,620
Had I known you were a demon,

573
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,300
I should've killed you last night.

574
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,110
But it was also you who hurried to save me

575
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,720
last night.

576
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,170
I meant to save a human, not a demon!

577
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,510
What poison have you spread

578
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,710
in Ning'an City?

579
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,220
You deny you saved me,

580
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,780
but I won't forget your kindness.

581
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,200
This is the long-lost Nether Poison of the Demon Race.

582
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,680
It has resurfaced now.

583
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,990
Mr. Eternal,

584
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,290
do you like

585
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,590
this thank-you gift?

586
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,800
Father!

587
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,390
Father.

588
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,570
Someone, help me carry my father back.

589
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,350
Go help her! Why are you hesitating?

590
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,630
He's your governor.

591
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,970
He's become like this to save you,

592
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,410
yet you're scared of him?

593
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,180
Listen.

594
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,070
My father won't become like that.

595
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,810
Father!

596
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,680
Give me the antidote!

597
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,280
This wasn't your attitude

598
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
when you saved me last night.

599
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,330
Father.

600
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,720
Lady Shuo, don't go over.

601
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,050
He'll bite you.

602
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,070
Father, wake up.

603
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,300
I'm Shuo!

604
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,510
Father.

605
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,530
Father.

606
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,550
Father.

607
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,960
Wake up.

608
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,900
I'm your daughter.

609
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,930
Drop the act.

610
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,860
Demons caused chaos among humans.

611
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,920
You deserve death!

612
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,960
You Eternals claim to uphold justice

613
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,440
and protect humans,

614
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,570
but look at them.

615
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,860
Humans are weak, useless,

616
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,160
and hypocritical.

617
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,400
When disaster strikes, they only care about themselves.

618
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,070
Is it worth it

619
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
protecting a race like this?

620
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,360
Nonsense!

621
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,960
Humans may be weak,

622
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,130
but their nature is pure and good.

623
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,590
If not for your Nether Poison,

624
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,180
how could these people have ended up like this?

625
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,940
Pure and good?

626
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,410
Ning'an has fallen,

627
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,050
and Bai Xun's been poisoned too.

628
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,570
I'd love to see

629
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,470
in this hellish world,

630
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,890
where all that

631
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,330
pure goodness is.

632
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,790
Cut the crap!

633
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,860
Give me the antidote.

634
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,200
The Nether Poison is incurable.

635
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,240
You have to kill all the mad people.

636
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,000
Otherwise,

637
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,010
as long as they're alive,

638
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,010
they'll stay mad.

639
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,150
Fine.

640
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,770
If you don't give it to me,

641
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,090
I'll trade your life

642
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,060
for the antidote with your master.

643
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,090
You think too highly of me.

644
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,540
The Master of Bright Moon Palace is ruthless

645
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,530
and wouldn't care about my life.

646
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,420
The Master of Bright Moon Palace?

647
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,260
With your strength,

648
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,790
you can't defeat my master.

649
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,350
If you want to live…

650
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,920
Flower demon again.

651
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,830
Get out of Ning'an City.

652
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,790
What's her connection to that top courtesan?

653
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,060
The Master of Bright Moon Palace?

654
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,920
The owner of Unbridled Pavilion!

655
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
We've stocked up on wound medicine,

656
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,740
but why can't I find any when I need it?

657
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,960
Look.

658
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,170
It looks just like my father, right?

659
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,890
This is the figurine you've spent days making

660
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,300
for your father's birthday?

661
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,150
Without the governor's armor,

662
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,500
Uncle Bai probably can't even recognize himself.

663
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,100
I've never done this before.

664
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,980
My hands hurt from shaping it.

665
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,630
This is the best one I made.

666
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,790
Tomorrow is his birthday.

667
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,320
Do you think he'll like it?

668
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,480
Uncle Bai will surely love

669
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
anything you give him.

670
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,120
Bai Shuo!

671
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,580
Father.

672
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,520
Look.

673
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,630
Get that away!

674
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,590
I warned you not to go to

675
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,160
the burial ground outside the city.

676
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,290
Why did you go again?

677
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,930
That's where Xi and I were saved by the immortal.

678
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,800
Why can't I go there?

679
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,130
There are no immortals!

680
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,480
I told you!

681
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,710
You're the daughter of the city governor.

682
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,010
You should know your place.

683
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,970
If Xi were here,

684
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,670
she wouldn't be as naughty as you!

685
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,300
Do you always wish

686
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,350
it had been me taken by the Taoist

687
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,780
instead of Xi?

688
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,950
You little brat.

689
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,680
Bai Xun, I hate you!

690
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,230
Shuo, Shuo!

691
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,800
Since you've glued it back together,

692
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,460
why didn't you tell me?

693
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
Lady Shuo, stop searching.

694
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,770
Wound medicine won't work on the madness.

695
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,670
Father,

696
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,970
hang in there.

697
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,340
Wait for me to come back.

698
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,800
Bai Yu.

699
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,960
Take care of my father.

700
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,090
I'll definitely find a way to cure him.

701
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,150
Lady Shuo.

702
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,500
It's dangerous outside!

703
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,949
What a distinguished guest.

704
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,010
What?

705
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,020
Are you here for drinks?

706
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,300
The rules between our two races still stand.

707
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,920
In the demon territory, how you fight among yourselves

708
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,340
is none of our concern.

709
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,139
But why did you come to mess with humans?

710
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,199
What nonsense are you talking about?

711
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Let him finish.

712
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,949
Three days ago,

713
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,310
your top courtesan spread poison throughout the city.

714
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,130
Today, your underlings used demon magic to control the mad people.

715
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,900
What do you want,

716
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,489
Master of Bright Moon Palace?

717
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,260
You can't even see such an obvious frame-up.

718
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,600
How foolish you are.

719
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,360
Lady Fu Ling from Cold Spring Palace

720
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,340
specializes in flower demons' teleportation and uses the Cloud Fire Bow.

721
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,860
You're so ill-informed.

722
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,270
Work on that.

723
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,520
You said it's a frame-up,

724
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,620
but why should I believe you?

725
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,190
Do I need you to believe me?

726
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,600
Right now, the city is in chaos, and the people are suffering.

727
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
I don't have time to argue with you about that.

728
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,220
The Nether Poison is from the demons.

729
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,410
Give me the antidote!

730
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,630
So you still care about the people, huh?

731
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,170
Shuo.

732
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,530
The blade should face the enemy;

733
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,260
the back should face yourself.

734
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,130
Remember this:

735
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,090
never

736
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,380
hold the blade to your own people.

737
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,630
If you truly cared about the people,

738
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,760
you should've reported the Nether Poison to Lanling Sect long ago.

739
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,100
But why haven't we

740
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,490
seen any help from Lanling?

741
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,000
You want to cure the poisoned,

742
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,130
but you wouldn't report it to Lanling.

743
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,820
Why is that?

744
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,120
Let me guess.

745
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,960
It's because

746
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,360
you're afraid.

747
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,800
You're afraid Lanling Sect will find out

748
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,390
that the Contemplation Stone is inside Bai Shuo,

749
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,390
and that they'll kill her to prevent future problems.

750
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,250
They say demons are evil,

751
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,970
but I think you Eternals are far greedier,

752
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,340
wanting everything.

753
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,890
You care for the commoners?

754
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,670
What a joke.

755
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,160
Help!

756
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,970
Ms. Bai, you came at the right time.

757
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,560
I was just discussing your life and death

758
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,380
with Mr. Chong Zhao, an Eternal.

759
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,730
Is what he said

760
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,590
true?

761
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,790
You're an Eternal?

762
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,610
You're actually an Eternal?

763
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,110
Say something!

764
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,240
Ms. Bai.

765
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,800
My restaurant welcomes humans but not Eternals.

766
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,010
If you have family matters to discuss,

767
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,340
please take them home.

768
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Don't be an annoying sight here

769
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,200
and disturb my peace.

770
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,220
Wait.

771
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,430
I need to talk to you.

772
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,580
Come with me.

773
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,040
Master.

774
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
You just let them go?

775
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,810
Bai Shuo came here

776
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,430
for Bai Xun.

777
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,620
Eternals

778
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,570
can't cure the demon poison.

779
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,700
She'll come back to beg me eventually.

780
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,740
When she comes,

781
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,700
she has to meet whatever conditions I have.

782
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,160
Shuo.

783
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,410
Hide here.

784
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,500
Once the demons in the city are killed and the chaos settles,

785
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,430
I'll come to you.

786
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,450
Why did you lie to me?

787
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,530
You know all along

788
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,270
that the only thing I've ever wanted

789
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,530
since a child is immortality.

790
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,260
Everyone laughed at me

791
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,360
and called me a fool.

792
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,880
For the past ten years,

793
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,840
you've watched as people mocked

794
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,880
and ridiculed me

795
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,710
and watched me argue with my father over and over.

796
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,170
Why did you never tell me you were an Eternal?

797
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,550
Answer me!

798
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,730
The rules of the Eternals forbid me.

799
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,820
Shuo.

800
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,120
I couldn't tell you.

801
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,860
The Eternals' rules?

802
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,080
Are those rules

803
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,690
more important than the family

804
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
with whom you've spent ten years?

805
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,940
How could you watch me act like a fool

806
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,640
without doing anything?

807
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,650
When you saw me chasing after those quacks

808
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,710
and calling them immortals,

809
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,040
what were you thinking?

810
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,000
Did you think I was laughable?

811
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,830
I never once thought that.

812
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,760
Since my parents died,

813
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,840
I've truly considered you and Uncle Bai

814
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,910
my family.

815
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,140
I've never thought of mocking you.

816
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
Family?

817
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,150
Back at Unbridled Pavilion,

818
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,140
you and Fan Yue were acting strange.

819
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,290
I had doubts,

820
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,870
but I didn't want to doubt you,

821
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,600
because you're Chong Zhao,

822
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,490
someone I consider family.

823
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,480
You've always known I hate being lied to,

824
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,160
yet the biggest liar around me

825
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,960
is you.

826
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,070
Shuo,

827
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,820
I didn't mean

828
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,160
to lie to you.

829
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,550
Alright.

830
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,000
Let's say you were bound by the rules

831
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
and couldn't tell me.

832
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,850
But since you're an Eternal,

833
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,200
you must have a way to save my father,

834
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,950
right?

835
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,010
You're young.

836
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,410
You may not be powerful,

837
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,830
but you must have a master

838
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,830
and a sect.

839
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,550
Go find them.

840
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,070
They must be powerful enough to have a solution,

841
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,800
right?

842
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,920
Shuo,

843
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,400
that's a demon poison.

844
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
The Eternal Race…

845
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,890
The Eternal Race can't cure it.

846
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,410
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

847
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,470
Even if my master comes,

848
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,660
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

849
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,830
there's nothing that can be done.

850
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,300
♫I remember that word of concern♫

851
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,080
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

852
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,070
We've lived together for ten years.

853
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,660
My father treated you like his own son,

854
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,430
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

855
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,880
yet you're telling me there's nothing that can be done.

856
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,490
♫It dried in the wind♫

857
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,620
Eternals are supposed to protect the people,

858
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,530
but who exactly are they protecting?

859
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,880
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

860
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,630

♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,100
