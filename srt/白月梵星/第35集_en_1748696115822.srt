1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
Transolved have even more loops suggested

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,900
People saw Puffer's statue

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,580
Eggman ideas

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,140
Puffer Japan

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish I was as good as the stars and the moon.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is here.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are here.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only wish to see every star and moon with the one I love.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wish you will be with me forever.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You and her are not the same person.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You and her are not the same person.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The world is here.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You and her are not the same person.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The world is here.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We are here.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We are here.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We are here.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We are here.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,680
After having had enough of it,

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,640
I once more received attitude

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,880
as if accessibility is required to improve the appearance.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Now the inside world seems

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,080
a little different from another찬

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,840
préc hypotheses

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,400
The world is full of

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
The world is full of

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,400
The world is full of

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,400
The world is full of

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,400
The world is full of

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,400
The world is full of

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
The world is full of

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,000
uth

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
All your wishes are granted.

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,200
Tonight.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,560
Fine.

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,200
So if you really wish it then

41
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,800
You know

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,520
We've done everything ourselves.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
So why aren't you leaving.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,980
The Waitress does not find the difficult thing

45
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,220
She wants to do more.

46
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,480
Although I...

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,720
Don't want to leave.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,720
So the Demon God still wants to fire the Star Moon Palace?

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Then I can't let you stay in the Night Clan.

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I decided not to use my hands to defeat you.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I want to fight with you with all my might.

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
If you win, I will never move back to the Star Moon Palace.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
My Demon Clan will never fight with the Night Clan.

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Of course, you can't use the Star Moon Palace.

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Otherwise, it's too unfair.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Why should I agree with you?

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Last night, I thought you didn't want to owe me.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
When?

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm still in the Night Clan.

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
When you feel lost, it's the day we fight.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Yes.

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I've made an appointment with you. If you lose...

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
No need. I won't lose.

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
God of War, you really want to keep the Demon God in the Night Clan?

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,720
He came here to destroy the Star Moon Palace?

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I agreed with him and I should fight with him.

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,720
God of War, don't be fooled by him.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,720
The Demon God is a famous demon. He has no sense of smell.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,720
He may be a shadow. There's no difference.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Besides, if the elders know you left the Demon God here...

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Xiuyan, what are you worried about?

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,720
God of War, the Demon God has been defeated.

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Your heart is frozen.

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
God of War...

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Get out.

77
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,180
God of War, Diholder

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Addapple

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Show both the blood and blood Tunis' blood.

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Don't do anything. It's none of your business.

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
What's your intention, God?

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
This is not the question you should ask.

83
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You're like a sheep.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,600
My heart is so excited.

85
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Wait for me.

86
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
My heart is cold.

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I want to see you.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You're my eternal flame.

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,600
The first time I've ever loved you.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,600
My heart is waiting for you.

91
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:16,600
The moment I'm in love with you.

92
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
It's so sunny today.

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You two are in a good mood.

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Why don't you go right away?

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I lost the game just now.

96
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm sure you're in a good mood.

97
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,600
The first time I've ever loved you.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,600
My heart is waiting for you.

99
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
You two are finally in a good mood.

100
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Who won?

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Who won?

102
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Qi Dong.

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Today, we're just preparing for the next fight.

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,600
My life has become a storm.

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
My heart is cold.

106
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You're my eternal flame.

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
The first time I've ever loved you.

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I want to see you.

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:34,600
You're my eternal flame.

110
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I want to see you.

111
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
How long has it been?

112
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
A hundred years.

113
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
A hundred years?

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
The hidden power of the Moon is actually the Southern Spell?

115
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Southern Spell is never the hidden power.

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
It's the root.

117
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
The Demon God Ye Ye used his blood to summon the Nine Spiritual Talismans.

118
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
He helped the Talisman to speed up the spiritual energy.

119
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
The hidden power of the God Army has been gone for the past ten years.

120
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
The 90 years of the future are over.

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
They never completed the agreement.

122
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I know they're not impossible, but not like.

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,600
The Night Clan and the Demon Clan are different.

124
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,600
That agreement may be their only excuse to accept the 100 years.

125
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
It's been a hundred years since the Human Clan.

126
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Maybe it's a lifetime.

127
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
But the Demon Clan has only been in need for a hundred years.

128
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
They're not aware of it.

129
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,600
It's hard to say that the love has been gone.

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Why are they not together?

131
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Aren't the two of them a way to protect each other?

132
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Because the Heaven Island is not in the best shape.

133
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The 90 Talisman seems to have been reborn.

134
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
The 90 Talisman is a spiritual form.

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
It's been a hundred years since the Star of the Moon.

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It's not a long time since the birth of the spirit.

137
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
It's been a hundred years.

138
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
The Demon God has been in the Night Clan for a hundred years.

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Do elders in the tribe have any advice?

140
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
It's a daily question of the day.

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I think it's time to go back.

142
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Are you planning to return to the Demon Clan

143
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
or to make a promise first?

144
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
A promise?

145
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Do you think we still need to fight?

146
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you think we still need to fight?

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
The Moon has been in the sea for a thousand years.

148
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It's been a few years.

149
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I think it's interesting to come back.

150
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
You don't like to be in the hands of the pig.

151
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
But this is a stone.

152
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
The God will not refuse it.

153
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
You are in a hurry.

154
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Why are you suddenly giving the gift?

155
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
The God wants to know why.

156
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Then follow me to a place.

157
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
The Moon?

158
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
The Demon Clan?

159
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
You have never been in the Demon Clan before.

160
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I have been in the Night Clan for a hundred years.

161
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I have been in the Night Clan for a hundred years.

162
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Don't you want to see the place where the Demon King lives?

163
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
This is indeed the first time I have been in the Demon Clan.

164
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
You look like the Demon Clan.

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You don't look like the Demon King in the rumors.

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
You are fighting without a weapon.

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You are so peaceful and stable.

168
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,600
You are more free than I thought.

169
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Free?

170
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
You can do that too.

171
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I am afraid that tomorrow is too far.

172
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I love you every moment.

173
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
They are also the gods.

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
But changing the world is a matter of time.

175
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
You can do whatever you want.

176
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Why are you still praying?

177
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Who is praying to you?

178
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
The Moon is my God's will.

179
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I can understand the will that the Moon is in the Moon.

180
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
When I am not busy, I will also help them.

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
The power of the God is related to the power of the three gods.

182
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Why do you want to tell me?

183
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Probably because I want to tell you.

184
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
What you just asked is how to live.

185
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
And what they are asking is the seven love six desires.

186
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Seven love six desires?

187
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
The love of the parents, the love of the brothers.

188
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
The love of the teachers, the love of the couple.

189
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,600
The desire of the parents is the desire of the lovers.

190
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
So Xing Yue, do you have a desire?

191
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Yes.

192
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Where is the demon god?

193
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
The light of my long night.

194
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Why did you bring me here?

195
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I am here to ask you.

196
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Xing Yue, I have a request.

197
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I am the demon god.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I have thousands of people.

199
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I am one of the three gods.

200
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I am not the god of the jade.

201
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I am the master of the jade.

202
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I am the master of the jade.

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
But this is the demon god's request.

204
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I am not the jade.

205
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I only want to be with the lovers.

206
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Take her to see the jade.

207
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
To see the jade.

208
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Not only Xing Yue,

209
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I want to see the scenery with her.

210
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
To see the jade.

211
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
To see every star.

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Xing Yue, I want to be with you forever.

213
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Are you willing to be my god?

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Yes.

215
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
I understand.

216
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
You don't understand.

217
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
I am the demon god.

218
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I am the master of the jade.

219
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I am the master of the jade.

220
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I am the master of the jade.

221
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I am the master of the jade.

222
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I am the master of the jade.

223
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I am the master of the jade.

224
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I am the master of the jade.

225
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I am the master of the jade.

226
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I am the master of the jade.

227
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I am the master of the jade.

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I am the master of the jade.

229
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I am the master of the jade.

230
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I am the master of the jade.

231
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I am the master of the jade.

232
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
How could it be?

233
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
The god has sent me to the temple.

234
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Yu Ying, please let me go.

235
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,380
Something is just still going on.

236
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,880
I want to u to be my Haohao

237
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,760
I want to catch fire

238
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,540
I wanna shed my life

239
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,300
But I cannot

240
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,640
Hu How about...

241
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,060
for you

242
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,700
to be my buddy

243
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,860
for so many years

244
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,960
Ich out comparing cities.

245
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,960
Can't stop disturbing each other.

246
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,200
What!?

247
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,380
You take a closer look!

248
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,460
~!

249
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,900
things..

250
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,160
I would doubt....

251
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Qingyuan!

252
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Qingyuan!

253
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Why? Why did you kill him?

254
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Because of you.

255
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Xing Yue, you are the power of the Heavenly Emperor.

256
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Protecting the God Yu's peace is the meaning of your existence.

257
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,160
And my mission is to kill everyone who can raise you.

258
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Because I love him, he will die.

259
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,160
It's my love that can't be left out.

260
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I can't be able to control Xing Yue Palace.

261
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm the one who can destroy the Heavenly Emperor.

262
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
What did he do? Why did he die?

263
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,160
This is the heaven.

264
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,160
No.

265
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I can't be able to control Xing Yue Palace.

266
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,160
No.

267
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm the power of the Heavenly Emperor.

268
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,160
My existence is the law of the gods.

269
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,160
If the Heavenly Emperor wants him to die, I will kill him.

270
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I will kill him.

271
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
I will kill him.

272
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Xing Yue, don't!

273
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm the one who can't be left out.

274
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I will fly.

275
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Heavenly Emperor, don't! Don't!

276
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
I will kill him.

277
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I will kill him.

278
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I will make the world disappear.

279
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Heavenly Emperor!

280
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Heavenly Emperor!

281
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Heavenly Emperor, even if you and the Demon God have a spirit,

282
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
you can help him to rebuild the Heavenly Palace.

283
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
You can transfer Xing Yue Palace's spirit to you.

284
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
But you can't eliminate the feelings of the Demon God.

285
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
As long as he is alive,

286
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,160
he will be able to save you.

287
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I will kill him.

288
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
I will kill him.

289
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I will kill him.

290
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Heavenly Emperor, you can't eliminate the feelings of the Demon God.

291
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
As long as he is with you,

292
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
as long as you love each other,

293
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
the Heavenly Palace of Xing Yue will be the same.

294
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Then he will destroy his love for Xing Yue.

295
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
He will destroy his love for Xing Yue.

296
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,160
His power is too strong.

297
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
I can only share his memories with him tonight.

298
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
When he wakes up,

299
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,160
he will no longer remember the appearance of the Demon God.

300
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Xiao Yan,

301
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
everything tonight

302
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,160
will never let him know.

303
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Xiao Yan.

304
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
After tonight,

305
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Xing Yue will become

306
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,160
the person who hates the Demon God,

307
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
the person who wants to go to the Garden.

308
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,160
The Demon God has restored everything.

309
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,160
He has pretend to be nothing.

310
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,160
The Garden doesn't have the memory of being hurt by the God Palace.

311
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
He has always asked from his heart

312
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,160
to confess his love to the God again.

313
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
That night,

314
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,160
the Moon Sea that hasn't been snowing for thousands of years,

315
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
has just started snowing.

316
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,160
I heard that the Moon Sea hasn't been snowing for thousands of years.

317
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I was the one who met you today.

318
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Snowing and white hair.

319
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
You are doing great.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Xing Yue,

321
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I want to be with you forever.

322
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Are you willing to be my god?

323
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
The Demon God asked this.

324
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Don't you think it's funny?

325
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
The gods are long-lasting.

326
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
That's why I keep you at the Star Moon Pavilion.

327
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,160
It's just because of the boring.

328
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
I can't.

329
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
You and I have been together for a hundred years.

330
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,160
It's just because of the boring.

331
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,160
It's not just that.

332
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
I don't like to kill.

333
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
So I'm willing to spend a hundred years

334
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
talking to the Demon God about the world.

335
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm willing to.

336
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
If the Demon God wants to repair the ice,

337
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
and the Moon God wants to balance it,

338
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,160
then I can be his friend.

339
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,160
But the Demon God asked for too much.

340
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
He...

341
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
He...

342
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I, the God of the Night Clan,

343
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,160
am in the same boat as the God of the Sky.

344
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
In my eyes,

345
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,160
the life is endless and there's no difference.

346
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
For the God of the Night Clan,

347
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,160
I'm not in the same boat as you.

348
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,160
But I want to be with you forever.

349
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,160
The Demon God, you're more than enough.

350
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,160
The life is endless and there's no difference.

351
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
For the God of the Night Clan,

352
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,160
there's no difference.

353
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Xing Yue,

354
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
we've been together for a hundred years.

355
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
We've been together for a hundred years.

356
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Is it just because of the Demon God?

357
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Yes.

358
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,160
I can't believe it.

359
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Since the Demon God doesn't believe it,

360
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,160
then I'll tell you what I think.

361
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,160
What do you want to know?

362
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
What do you want to know?

363
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,280
I want to ask you,

364
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,680
why I can summon your Purple Moon

365
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,400
and even control it?

366
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
Because I knew

367
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
your magical power was Purple Moon.

368
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,200
You've been in the Star Moon Pavilion for a hundred years.

369
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,840
I've been working on it

370
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,680
to make it invisible

371
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,520
and to make it invisible in your body.

372
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,520
I can control your magical power completely.

373
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,400
That's impossible.

374
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,080
Why would I notice that?

375
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,960
Of course you wouldn't notice.

376
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
You're always using the Holy Blood

377
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,120
to heal the soul of the Nine-Spirit Soul.

378
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
It's not easy to hide

379
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,360
and hold your life.

380
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
But it's not impossible.

381
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,920
You know...

382
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,520
You know what I'm doing every day.

383
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,400
You've used that time.

384
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,920
Time doesn't matter.

385
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,080
As long as I can achieve my goal.

386
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,380
The Moon

387
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,640
Good.

388
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,560
Good.

389
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Good.

390
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,840
Star Moon,

391
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,160
even if you keep me in the Star Moon Pavilion for a hundred years,

392
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
it's only for controlling my magical power.

393
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,240
Even if you do this,

394
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
It's just for your so-called deep depression.

395
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Then what about the hundred years we've been together?

396
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
What about the hundred years we've been together?

397
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
What exactly am I to you?

398
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,880
The hundred years you've been against me.

399
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
You've been through all this.

400
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Sleep with me.

401
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,680
Take me.

402
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,120
No.

403
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,600
You're hit.

404
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,780
My life背著你的一次

405
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,540
無數事業付你的喜悅

406
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,280
分心一圓 不聞明天

407
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,500
每次踐手

408
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,180
物方的時間

409
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,720
走起來

410
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,920
頭包著護眼

411
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,080
有舟回眼明

412
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,940
還留完你的臉

413
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,540
Do you wanna go?

414
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,620
Let her be.

415
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,940
I'll make you happy drink it me.

416
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,820
I dare to do it kneeling withblade.

417
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,560
One mistake led to longest me.

418
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,660
I'll never be free hold of you

419
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,160
and the daddy and your license

420
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,980
I will never give up

421
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,140
But on your part To show you

422
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,220
how much trouble it takes

423
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,820
to get them out of here

424
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,180
Even your name didn't change

425
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,640
Will this river end

426
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,620
My dear

427
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,340
I have sent my best wish for you with my hope of victory

428
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,400
so everywhere I can see you

429
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,120
I've made my best wish

430
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,320
Dear lPSsssssss

431
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,860
Be mesured by God

432
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,760
May you have plenty of grace

433
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,140
Fun!

434
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,980
Saint child!

435
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
Stop now!

436
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,320
You are already a god.

437
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,160
Now has a divine power.

438
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,400
you die!

439
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Ah!

440
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Xiaojun!

441
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I've always underestimated her obsession.

442
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Xiao Yan, from tomorrow,

443
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
the Star Moon Pavilion will be closed.

444
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
No one in the Jin Clan will come.

445
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
You've neglected me.

446
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
You've just completely re-entered my feelings.

447
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
But your body...

448
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm innocent.

449
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

450
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
You must bear all the consequences.

451
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Xiao Yan,

452
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,400
the Demon God doesn't know what you've done for her.

453
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
He doesn't know that

454
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
he's already dead under the punishment of the Star Moon Pavilion.

455
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You've taken all the consequences for her.

456
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
But you only came back to her with your hatred.

457
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Do you know that?

458
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Time is not worth it.

459
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I didn't deserve it or not.

460
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
He didn't do anything wrong.

461
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
He didn't even let me down.

462
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
He did it for me.

463
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Xiaojun.

464
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Star Moon,

465
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
you've said so many things today.

466
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm extremely grateful.

467
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll take you out of the coffin

468
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
and take back the rest of my life.

469
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll take back everything that I've lost.

470
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
You've done so much for her.

471
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
If you know the truth,

472
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
you'll be punished.

473
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
No one will know

474
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
that I'm a great God.

475
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Because the people who know

476
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
must die.

477
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Star Moon,

478
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
you've done so much for her.

479
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You've done so much for her.

480
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You've done so much for her.

481
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
You've done so much for her.

482
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
You've done so much for her.

483
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
You've done so much for her.

484
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
You've done so much for her.

485
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
You've done so much for her.

486
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
You've done so much for her.

487
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You've done so much for her.

488
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
You've done so much for her.

489
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
You've done so much for her.

490
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
You've done so much for her.

491
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
God.

492
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
The Demon God, the Night God,

493
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
is badly injured from the Moon Shadow Sea.

494
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
This matter has been passed down to the gods.

495
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
I got it.

496
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Leave.

497
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Yes.

498
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Jing Yuan, even I can't get her heart.

499
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
You think that for the next hundred years, I can let Xing Yue fall in love with you?

500
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
You can't do anything I can't do.

501
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
How can you do that?

502
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
You went to the playground again.

503
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
You went to the playground again.

504
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
You came back now.

505
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Xing Chen's power is still not gone.

506
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Not enough.

507
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I still need to absorb more of the spirit of the Night Demon Clan.

508
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,400
The Night Demon Clan is in the world.

509
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
It's time to change.

510
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
The power can actually destroy everything.

511
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,400
The world only knows that the power of the Three Kingdoms cannot be weakened.

512
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,400
But no one has ever thought that the Three Kingdoms' spirit and power can be strong and strong.

513
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,400
It can produce the power of destroying everything.

514
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
And this evil power was lost by Mo Li.

515
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
She used the evil power to force the power to bury the dead.

516
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
What about Xing Yue? Can't she stop it?

517
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
She used the power of Xing Yue to seal the love?

518
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Love is not death.

519
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
People's hearts are not in danger.

520
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
The God of War has been trying to get rid of the love of Jing Yuan.

521
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
But the love of Jing Yuan has already entered the valley.

522
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
It's like the wild grass.

523
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
It's not close to the battlefield.

524
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
It's not far from the end.

525
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
The God of War has never thought that

526
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,400
even the strongest power in the world can't seal the love.

527
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Xing Yue's love for Jing Yuan is so deep.

528
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
From the God of War to seal his love,

529
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400
his power starts to fall.

530
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
He used the power of the world to make it.

531
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,400
If the power falls, it means that he is God.

532
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,400
But the only one who can help him

533
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
is the one who hates him the most.

534
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
What did Jing Yuan do?

535
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Jing Yuan entered the monster's secret realm and closed the closed door.

536
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
The monster's secret realm has a strong spirit.

537
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
But it's fast to control the monster.

538
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
But it's also trapped in the God of War, the Red-Haired Bear.

539
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,400
It's never revived to the secret realm.

540
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,400
But to remove the power of Xing Chen in the Purple Moon,

541
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Jing Yuan has been in the secret realm for three years.

542
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Because the power keeps falling,

543
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
most of the time, the God of War is asleep.

544
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,400
The existence of the God of War is the time for the peace.

545
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
He can't let anyone know about this.

546
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,400
But I didn't expect that after Jing Yuan entered the secret realm,

547
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
he had a fight with the Night Clan.

548
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
The Night Clan defeated the Elder Chang Qing.

549
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,400
The God of War didn't know what the God of War was.

550
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,400
He just asked the God of War to save Chang Qing.

551
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
God, you can't go to the Demon Clan.

552
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
How long have I slept this time?

553
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Ten days.

554
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
God, I'll go to the Demon Clan for you.

555
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
I'll go back to the Elder Chang Qing.

556
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,400
I can feel that he has already eliminated the seal on the Purple Moon.

557
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
You go to the Wuyou.

558
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
But now the Demon God has been hating you.

559
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,400
You can't go to the Demon Clan for a fight like this.

560
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
The seal is gone.

561
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,400
He just wants a big one.

562
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I owe him.

563
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
God, if you are trapped in the Demon Clan,

564
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
you can't rush back to the Star Moon to talk about the seal.

565
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Your power will disappear faster.

566
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
I know.

567
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I guessed that you would come.

568
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
But I didn't expect that.

569
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
It seems that not everyone is in the eyes of God.

570
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
They are all the people of the Tower.

571
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Where is Chang Qing?

572
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,400
I, Ji Yun, used his life to save you.

573
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
He is still alive.

574
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
If that's the case,

575
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Demon God, fight.

576
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
God, you don't need to go to the Moon Palace for a fight with me.

577
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
You are too high-ranked.

578
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Or do you want to kill me?

579
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I used to have a saving wish.

580
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
If there is a fight, I will be fair.

581
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
A saving wish?

582
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
If this is the case,

583
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
three years ago,

584
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I might have gone back to the God's Lord.

585
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I was in love with him.

586
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I was in love with him.

587
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I don't want to be in love with him.

588
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
But God's hand is not yours.

589
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You are right.

590
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
I will go back to the God's Lord.

591
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
I will go back to the God's Lord.

592
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
But God's hand is not yours.

593
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,400
I have been in love with him for three years.

594
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
I am so lucky.

595
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,400
I don't want to be in love with him.

596
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Demon God, you still remember.

597
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You don't need to waste your time to save me.

598
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I am a mortal.

599
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
I don't have time to waste here.

600
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Ji Yun, where is Chang Qing?

601
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Why do you need to worry about me?

602
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I have wasted so much time to let you come.

603
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Of course, I have a big gift to give you.

604
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Why does it look like a Star Pavilion?

605
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
The Moon is in the air.

606
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
This is my spirit.

607
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I am here to visit the Star Pavilion.

608
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Do you like it?

609
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Qing Yun, what do you want?

610
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I want you to tell the gods.

611
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
The Star Pavilion Goddess will marry into the Demon Clan.

612
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I will marry you in ten days.

613
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I will marry you in ten days.

614
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Come to me.

615
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Come to me.

616
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Come to me.

617
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Come to me.

618
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Come to me.

619
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,400
My heart is so excited.

620
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
My heart is so excited.

621
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
My heart is so excited.

622
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Wait for me.

623
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Wait for me.

624
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The stars are shining brightly.

625
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh, you are the light I long for.

626
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,400
You are the only reason I am here.

627
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,400
I will let this moment be with you.

628
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,400
I will go to the sea with you.

629
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Oh, you are the light I long for.

630
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,400
You are the blue earth I long for.

631
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I will let this moment be with you.

632
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,400
I will let this moment be with you.
