Destoug'll Reader

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm willing to be as a star, as a soldier, as a moon.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The late demon, the scholar, you and he are not the same person.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The dream is coming true.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A man like you is a star.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to be with you forever.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to be with you forever.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The late demon, the scholar, you and he are not the same person.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The late demon, the scholar, you and he are not the same person.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The dream is coming true.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are together forever.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We are together forever.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The late demon, the scholar, you and he are not the same person.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You dare to touch him?

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Give him some medicine.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let him die.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't see it.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are protecting him.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are protecting him.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are protecting him.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why don't you save us?

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't go.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't go.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dian Zhuang.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The cold spring palace has sent out the antidote to the City Leader's mansion.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The people of the city are only in the City Leader's mansion.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Bai Shu is sent out.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Bai Xun doesn't know that Bai Shu is poisoned.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Without the medicine, he will be in trouble.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Stop.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Send me back.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Stop.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I said stop.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Uncle, stop.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Send me back.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Stop.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said stop.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Miss, Miss.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can't go.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can't go back.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I know my brother's temper well.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If I go, he will die.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let go of me.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Miss.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The City Leader is the City Leader.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No matter what happens,

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will take you away.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The City Leader is in danger.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I must take you away.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will go.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I am sorry.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't go to Ning'an City if you break the code of Kao Zhen.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Fan Yue.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He didn't break the code.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It seems that the poison is useless to him.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is it because he is so insensitive?

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to take you back to Ning'an City.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You three,

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
lock the people in the city.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The City Leader of Haoyue.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Fan Yue, let him go.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They are the ancestors of your new year?

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Or the ancestors of Lanling?

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's the White-Headed.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can't go.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Fan Yue,

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the first two demons have already been decided.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can't kill the people.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You just stole the city of the five-leafed.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You even messed up the people.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's wrong with that?

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Jin Yao.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The five-leafed are all my power.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you don't want to destroy the city of Lanling,

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you can just kill them.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You are crazy.

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You are crazy.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You are crazy.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are crazy.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are crazy.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are crazy.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Uncle.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The city is full of demons.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They all want to take away the five-leafed.

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are in danger here.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There are master and uncle.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They can protect the White-Headed.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come back to Lanling and kill them.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let go of me.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Chongzhe,

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I won't believe the people who lied to me.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going back to find my father.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't have time to listen to you.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Uncle.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let go of him.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let go of me.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let go of me.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let go of me.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are right.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Bai Shuo was taken back by Fan Yue.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The five-leafed are also here.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They are fighting with Fan Yue.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Lanling and the five-leafed

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
can't kill Fan Yue.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But at least they can drag him down.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you see that?

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Remember.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The city is full of demons.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The people are just a shadow.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bai Shuo is almost here.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know what to do.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hurry up.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hurry up.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Help.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let go of me.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Take the knife back.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Take the knife back.

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Chengchun.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Please give me the medicine.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Please.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Please.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Please.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Please.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Please.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Please.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Please.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Chengchun.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Help.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Chengzhu's parents.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They don't have the medicine.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I can't save them.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't break it.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why did you break the medicine?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You just don't want to break it.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can't break it.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Take the medicine.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Take the medicine.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Take the medicine.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Take the medicine.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Bai Shun.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dad.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Look at me.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Dad.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Bai Shun.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop shouting.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There are the robbers.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They can't hear you.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
They can't see you.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What do you want?

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let me go.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't be anxious.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Since they are back,

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
let's watch a good show.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't have the medicine.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why do you want to live a good life?

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Bai Shun.

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We have been torturing you.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We have been torturing you.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We have been torturing you.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We have been torturing you.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You little kid.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You are so heartless!

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let go of me.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let go of me.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let go of me.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let go of me.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Bai Shun.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are selfish.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You are only a fool.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You are not a master.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You are not even a master.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Master.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You are useless.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have to be a master.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What are you doing?

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't you think you are ungrateful?

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You are a man of the past.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You only need to be a man of the past.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How dare you!

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are not even a master.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's better to be a master.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Master.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I will kill you.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I will kill you.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Master, you are dead.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Master.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Master.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Master.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Master.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Master.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Master.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Princess consort is killing only yourself.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No.

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Chief, can it be possible to kill of a real man?

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
的 doing this is for personal improvement.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you go for a master still,

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
everyone will be convinced.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You shut up!

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm going to die!

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You know,

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
there's no end to this poison.

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No death, no rest.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's always someone who dies today.

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Kill him!

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000

Kill him!

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kill him!

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Kill him!

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Kill him!

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Stop fighting!

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Kill him!

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000

What are you doing?

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hold on!

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Father!

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Father!

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Father!

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Father!

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Father!

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Father!

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Father!

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Father!

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Father!

Father!

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Father!

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Father, let go of me!

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Father, let go of me!

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Father, don't bite me!

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Father, let go of me!

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Father, let go of me!

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Go!

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Go!

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Father, wake up!

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Father, wake up!

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hold on!

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I will kill you!

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I will kill you!

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't!

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can't save you!

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is not fair!

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I really don't want to live!

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Bai Yu!

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000

Hurry!

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know

279
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
why Ning'an City is so dirty.

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But I know

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that there is God in this world.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
God is on the throne!

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Bai Xu is willing to sacrifice his life

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to save Ning'an City

285
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
from the disaster.

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I will sacrifice my life

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
to save Ning'an City.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Stop!

290
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Stop!

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Stop!

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000

Don't sleep!

298

I won't let you die!

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You didn't mean to bring me back

300
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
with you, did you?

301
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We haven't got you yet!

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't sleep!

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's all your fault!

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's all because of you!

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I killed you!

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can save you, I can save you!

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can save you!

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Kill me.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The first face is not to kill you.

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's to kill you.

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Master.

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000

Did you see that?

352
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a fairy.

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Is it a fairy?

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
My child is cured.

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000

I'm okay.

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Any side effects?

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Am I okay?

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you alright?

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
My baby.

How about forging theărniDidn't it?

374
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,760
Bai Xun passed away.

375
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
Headikit, do n't you want...

376
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,360
the dessert party here?

377
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,160
Lost your memory

378
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,040

I'm losing my strength.

386
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
The sky is not yours.

387
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Enren!

388
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Is this the Moon Sea?

389
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Yes.

390
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
It's not.

391
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
This is your consciousness sea.

392
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
What you saw is just my consciousness.

393
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
To be honest,

394
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
your father is not your father.

395
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
To be honest,

396
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
your father's death

397
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
makes you very painful.

398
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Enren,

399
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
I beg you to save my father.

400
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Ten years ago, you were a servant.

401
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
You are Enci.

402
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I know what I am not qualified to ask for.

403
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
But my father loves the city and is famous.

404
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
He has been loyal for his whole life.

405
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,100
He knows that he has not given up on his life.

406
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,100
He is the one who should live the most.

407
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
I beg you to save him.

408
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Or...

409
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Or give him my life.

410
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Let him live.

411
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
You want to die.

412
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
I don't want to die.

413
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
But I can go without a path.

414
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
The world can die in return.

415
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Only God can do that.

416
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
No.

417
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
You are wrong.

418
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
It's you who can die in the dry moon.

419
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
It's you.

420
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Me?

421
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I can't save you.

422
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I can't save you.

423
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
I am just a mortal.

424
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
How can I save you?

425
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
As long as you have enough power,

426
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
you can.

427
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Enough power?

428
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
How can I have enough power?

429
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Remember,

430
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
start over.

431
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Start over?

432
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
To be honest,

433
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
remember,

434
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
the meaning of your existence

435
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
is not to repay anyone.

436
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
It's not to live for anyone.

437
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
I don't think it's up to you.

438
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
It's luck.

439
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
It's a cause.

440
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
God is great.

441
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
He will destroy everything.

442
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
There is no way ahead.

443
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
There is no way out.

444
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
You have to find your own way.

445
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
What is the way to stimulate?

446
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Enren,

447
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
who are you?

448
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
There is always one day,

449
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
you will know.

450
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
I will wait for you.

451
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
What?

452
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Father.

453
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Where is my father?

454
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Where is my father?

455
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,580
lowest job

456
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,320
No reason.

457
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,400
You went all in.

458
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,920
End freeze.

459
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Meat is for $600 often.

460
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,000
Brother,

461
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,380
This is for you.

462
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,380
I remember those words

463
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,380
But I can't remember them

464
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,380
I remember there was a little bit of tears

465
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,380
I can't see the people in the wind

466
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,380
How many times have I been in my dreams

467
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,380
That year, that year

468
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Flowers bloom in the dark

469
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,380
I'm afraid that the autumn wind will leave the year

470
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,380
But the rain is full of the day

471
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,380
That year, that year

472
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,380
The moon is falling and the sky is falling

473
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,380
I'm like a mud, I'm like a grass, I'm like a leaf

474
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,380
The mountains and the mountains are falling

475
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,380
I remember

476
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,380
That year, that year

477
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Flowers bloom in the dark

478
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,380
I'm afraid that the autumn wind will leave the year

479
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,380
But the rain is full of the day

480
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,380
That year, that year

481
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,380
The moon is falling and the sky is falling

482
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm like a mud, I'm like a grass, I'm like a leaf

483
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,380
The mountains and the mountains are falling

484
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,380
I'm like a mud

485
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:04,380
ば

486
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,380
지는

487
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,380
What a sight

488
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,380
Much better

489
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,380
What a sight

490
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,380
The people who suffered the most

491
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,380
are not the people we want.

492
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
If you can keep White Snake at home,

493
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
it must be a test for you.

494
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
Test?

495
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
You're kidding.

496
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Is there only you know?

497
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,380
You can let White Snake choose

498
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,380
if you want to enter the Demon Hall.

499
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,380
You can't let White Snake choose.

500
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Does it hurt?

501
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Wipe it.

502
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
Thank you, Master.

503
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Do you know why I punished you?

504
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,380
I thought I saved Chongzhao.

505
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
But I failed.

506
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,380
I came here to take a risk.

507
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Wrong.

508
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
You saved him for the first time.

509
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,380
I said I won't punish you if I don't punish you.

510
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
I'm angry because

511
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,380
you made the same mistake the second time.

512
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Do you think I can't tell?

513
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,380
You took the initiative to help me

514
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
before I came here.

515
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,380
You saved Chongzhao.

516
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
It seems that the Demon Lord of the Fulin

517
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,380
has a good intention.

518
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,380
It's a pity that he's a fairy.

519
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,380
Master punished me.

520
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,380
I can't stand it.

521
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,380
But you're the one who's the most naughty.

522
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Exactly.

523
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
But I'm curious too.

524
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,380
What's your intention to take Chongzhao?

525
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,380
I don't have any intention.

526
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,380
As I said before,

527
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
I want to make him

528
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
a good person

529
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
and make him a good person.

530
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Okay.

531
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Then you can say it.

532
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
Take him away.

533
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
Take him away.

534
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,380
I'll give you some more time.

535
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
How about a month?

536
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,380
Let him do everything for me in a month.

537
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
If he can't do it,

538
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll have to do it myself.

539
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I understand him.

540
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Do you understand?

541
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Yes.

542
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Go.

543
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Go.

544
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,380
It's because you're so close to him

545
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,380
that you can't stand it.

546
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,380
But Chongzhao,

547
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,380
from now on,

548
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
you're no longer a family.

549
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,380
In my dad's life,

550
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
when he was a student,

551
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,380
he had a good life.

552
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,380
I knew he wouldn't die.

553
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,380
But I never thought he'd leave like this.

554
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,380
I've always been the one who's so naughty.

555
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,380
I thought

556
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,380
I was the one who wanted to be

557
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,380
and I should be the one who's responsible for the consequences.

558
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,380
But why is it my dad?

559
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,380
What did I do wrong?

560
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Why did he die at the end?

561
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,380
Why did he die at the end?

562
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
It's all my fault.

563
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,380
I didn't protect Uncle Bai.

564
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
Uncle,

565
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,380
come back to Xianmen with me.

566
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
The Demon Clan is dead now.

567
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Only Xianmen can protect you now.

568
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,380
You said you'd protect my dad

569
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,380
if you were outside.

570
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,380
You said you'd protect my dad

571
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,380
in Ning'an.

572
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,380
You also said you'd protect your dad

573
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
if you were outside.

574
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,380
The immortal in this world,

575
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,380
the Demon,

576
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,380
and the human.

577
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,380
I never knew

578
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,380
that Xianmen would save him.

579
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,380
But I thought I was wrong.

580
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,380
I thought I was wrong.

581
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,380
I didn't blame you.

582
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,380
But I couldn't blame you.

583
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,380
So, Chongzhang,

584
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,380
you were the one

585
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,380
who saved my dad.

586
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
I was the one

587
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,380
who saved my dad.

588
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
But there's one thing

589
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,380
that I hope you can tell me.

590
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Who did you poison with your own hands?

591
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
You want to know?

592
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Tell me!

593
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
The Demon Clan is in the palace.

594
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,380
Zhenyu is in the palace.

595
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Zhenyu is in the palace?

596
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
Uncle, listen to me.

597
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Don't be impulsive.

598
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Zhenyu is the one who killed the Demon King.

599
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,380
Mom.

600
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,380
I will live well.

601
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,380
I will live to avenge my dad.

602
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I will live well.

603
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
I will live well.

604
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,380
Zhenyu is the one who saved my dad.

605
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
I will live well.

606
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
I will live well.

607
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Zhenyu is the one who killed the Demon King.

608
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,380
I'm not afraid!

609
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,380
Zhenyu is the demon king!

610
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
I'm so tired.

611
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,380
Zhenyu is the doge.

612
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,380
Zhenyu is the Demon King.

613
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Zhenyu is the doge.

614
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,380
You deserve your sacrifice.

615
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,080
His tens to a thousand farewells

616
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,520
Seraph edition

617
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,220
They were ל ότι many years ago

618
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,560
DaKN can see

619
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,680
Human race does not focuses and

620
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,020
Jinyao made a moan

621
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,840
These human race are not forget

622
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,100
The duosies of dashing those

623
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,100
In their hearts, Bai Xun is just a young man who is sick and dying.

624
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
They can't bear to be with them for long.

625
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,100
This immortal is quite a noble man.

626
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Master, when will we bring Bai Shuo back to the Demon Clan?

627
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Old man, I'm leaving.

628
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,100
The Immortal Clan has removed the memories of the whole city.

629
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,100
They don't know what they've done.

630
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
They haven't repaid you yet.

631
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,100
They've given you a gift.

632
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,100
They've cried for you.

633
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
They've given you a gift.

634
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,100
They've given you a gift.

635
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,100
For the sake of matters that have been 있으니까,

636
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,100
they've put out the adversaries of their lives.

637
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Is it worth it...?

638
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Chongzhao told me to come back back if anything better came up

639
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,100
and I'll find a place that would help them both with the storm.

640
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
But I now understand

641
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,100
The demon clan has no love, the fairy clan has no power,

642
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,100
the human clan has no power.

643
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,100
No one can rely on it, and no one can trust it.

644
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
It's better to beg for mercy than to beg for mercy.

645
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Don't worry.

646
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:01,100
One day, I will force Xianyang to avenge you.

647
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Why do you want to avenge me?

648
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Who allowed you to come to my father?

649
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
You want to avenge Lengquan Palace, right?

650
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I can help you if you want to.

651
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Where are you going to die?

652
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Give me the food and water, and you won't use it?

653
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,100
I remember you said that the price of the food and water is not reasonable.

654
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
The price of the food and water is my father's life.

655
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Yes.

656
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I don't beg for mercy, but I won't let you let my father live.

657
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Get out.

658
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I really plan to leave this city.

659
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,100
But you have to be with me.

660
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Why should I be with you?

661
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
You have no right to choose.

662
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Who said I didn't?

663
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,100
I said, don't let my father die.

664
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Let him live.

665
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,100
Fengyuan, I am just a human being.

666
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I am in your eyes.

667
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,100
But if I am forced, I will bite you.

668
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,100
If you didn't push me to live, Leng Yan would be here.

669
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
My father wouldn't be here.

670
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Fengyuan, remember, I am willing to avenge my father.

671
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
I am willing to avenge my father.

672
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,100
I am willing to avenge my father.

673
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
You are not afraid of death for a breath?

674
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
I am afraid.

675
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
But I am more afraid that my father will die.

676
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
You are not a new demon.

677
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
You don't know what is love.

678
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
You don't know what my father is.

679
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Master! Master! Master!

680
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Master!

681
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Let him go!

682
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
You are not powerful.

683
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Even if you are a demon, you can't harm yourself.

684
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Fengyuan, if you take him away,

685
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
you will be the enemy of the whole Lanling Sect.

686
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Then you will be the enemy of the Immortal Sect.

687
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Go back and tell Jin Yao that I am the one who took him away.

688
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,100
I will wait for the chance to come.

689
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Master!

690
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Master, how are you?

691
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
I am not dead.

692
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,100
It has been a long time since the princess has been so heavy.

693
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Master, you don't understand.

694
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I am not dead.

695
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I am not dead.

696
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
I am not dead.

697
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
I am not dead.

698
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Master, you don't understand.

699
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,100
That Chongzhao saved you once.

700
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Why did you help him?

701
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Didn't you already pay back the debt you should pay back?

702
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
It's not debt.

703
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,100
What is that?

704
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
It's a feeling.

705
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
I can't even feel it in a week.

706
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
You don't have to worry about it.

707
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
Go and check on something for me.

708
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
What is it?

709
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,100
Chongzhao has been through everything since he was born.

710
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,100
No matter what.

711
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
What does the Young Lord do with these things?

712
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,100
Let him come to my world.

713
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
The hell world.

714
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
What is this?

715
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
A good place.

716
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I didn't say I would come.

717
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Didn't you want to take revenge?

718
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
You thought you could help me with the Blue Spirit?

719
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
They can't help me.

720
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,100
It doesn't mean I have to be a burden to you.

721
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
Even if I don't go to the Immortal Gate,

722
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
I will never serve the Demon Clan.

723
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
I will never do it.

724
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
I will never do it.

725
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100
I will never do it.

726
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
I will never do it.

727
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
I will never serve the Demon Clan.

728
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,100
I will choose my own path.

729
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
No one is qualified to decide for me.

730
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,100
So you want to go back to Ning'an City

731
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
and be your dream girl?

732
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
Or do you want to wander around the King of Peach Blossom?

733
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,100
None of your business.

734
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,100
I don't want to interfere with your life.

735
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
In my eyes,

736
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
you are just the glory of the Immortal Gate.

737
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
But the Immortal Gate is mine.

738
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
So you are mine too.

739
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,100
The Immortal Gate

740
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,100
Episode 1

741
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
I will never do it.

742
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
I will never do it.

743
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,100
I will never do it.
