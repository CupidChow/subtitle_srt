I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
The world is here.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
We are here.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,700
I want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,700
The late demon, the scholar, you and him are not the same person.

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,700
I only want to be with you forever.

16
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,700
A dragon has a heart.

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,700
I want to be with you forever.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
I want to be with you forever.

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
I want to be with you forever.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,700
We are together forever.

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I want to be with you forever.

After becoming sister of agent Yi good

Go! Go!

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Go! Go!

Go! Go!

Go! Go!

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Go! Go!

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Young Master,

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
that Chongzhao Fairy Lord seems to be not in the city anymore.

35
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
It must be your trick to succeed.

36
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
He will return to the Blue Forest to search for the Hall of the Moon.

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Then he will be able to earn it.

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Then let this city be more chaotic.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
When the Big Blue Dragon 5000 arrives,

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
he will see the best view of the Blue Forest.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
The Blue Forest is the most dangerous place in the world.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
THE BL cocoon

dialottes

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
The Nurfrost Martial fact will make the revolution useless.

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
The first demon that committed the crime

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
she was evoused.

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
The further the demon came,

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
OOOOO

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
more than 500 million safety

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
If I do it myself,

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
will I be able to trigger the power of the Divine Power

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
and break the barrier of the Chongzhao?

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Old man is still waiting for me.

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
I must go back.

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Half of the chance is to get through it.

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,040
A-Xin, you will be the one to avoid me, right?

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
A-Xin, I've done it.

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You didn't come back?

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
At least I need to catch you and get you out of here.

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
God? I thought you couldn't let me go.

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Don't talk nonsense.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Who are you to make me so curious?

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
You're not going to leave with me?

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
If you don't want to,

79
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll take your body back to Yike.

80
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,040
If you don't want to, I'll take your body back to Yike.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Dragon Fire Palace? You're indeed a master of the Cold Spring Palace.

82
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
How about I?

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Dragon Fire Palace

84
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
I have a disciple.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
You want to hurt him?

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Master.

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Are you hurt?

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm fine.

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
You're so kind.

90
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
You're the Princess of the Cold Spring Palace.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
There are some things, but you're not smart enough.

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm teaching you.

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
In this situation, even if you recognize this fan,

94
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
you should pretend you don't know.

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Only by doing this, can I spare your life.

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Since you're using this fan,

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
you don't want to hide your identity.

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
You're not stupid.

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Fine. I'll think about it again.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
If the late Lan Ling is the first disciple of the Jin Yao Sect,

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
and is killed in Ning'an City,

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,040
how many people will the Immortal Sect send?

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
The murderer Fan Yue.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
He's still alive.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
You really are the master of the Cold Spring Palace?

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes.

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Thank you, Immortal.

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll take your life.

109
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Give me a reason.

110
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Fan Yue won't save you.

111
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
He saved me once.

112
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
You mean, Huan En?

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Do you know what those old men will say when he comes back?

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
The rules of the Cold Spring Palace,

116
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,040
you'll be punished for your mistakes today.

117
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I'll do as you say, but I save him not just for Huan En.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,040
I think he's a person who can be saved.

119
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Saving?

120
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Gui Jiu Bai is a person who can save Ning'an City.

121
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,040
He's a immortal, but he can be used by the evil.

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
You can have a more immortal.

123
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Immortal?

124
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Your suggestion is interesting.

125
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
But besides that,

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
do you really have no other ideas?

127
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Of course not.

128
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm only here for you.

129
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I won't punish you today.

130
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,040
It's not because of your excuse.

131
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
It's just because you're my disciple.

132
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
I can't bear to kill you.

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
I'll punish you again.

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes.

135
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
It's not a good thing to do.

136
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
But you must complete the task of taking Wu Nian Shi away.

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Don't let me down.

138
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I understand.

139
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
I'll do what I need to do.

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
You seem to know the truth.

141
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
In Ning'an City, what will happen?

142
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
If the poison is wrong,

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Ning'an City will be a place for people to live.

144
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
People must live and die.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040
You're right, I'm the one who killed him.

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Let him go.

147
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
I'll tell you everything I saw in the Five-Nation Stone.

148
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
As a exchange, I want the antidote for the poison.

149
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Miss Bai, this is the first time.

150
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
You've already messed up the An Cheng.

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Bai Cheng is a very famous poison.

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Do you still think you have the right to talk about the transaction?

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,040
You've been lying to me for five years.

154
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
You've made me trust you.

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
But now you know that my father was poisoned.

156
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
But you don't use this chance to pull me.

157
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Why? The Five-Nation Stone is the key to the Five-Nation Stone.

158
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,040
The opposite is that the Five-Nation Stone is the source of the Five-Nation Soul.

159
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
The poison in the stone is not what you think.

160
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,040
But you want to use the An Cheng to force the Five-Nation Soul to use me to think.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I want to see the Five-Nation Soul to be the hell.

162
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
But the human race is the human race.

163
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Even if you guess what I'm thinking, what can you do?

164
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,040
The Five-Nation Stone

165
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm indeed just a human race.

166
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I can threaten you.

167
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
But no matter what you think, I'm not the one to be.

168
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
If the poison is poisoned,

169
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,040
I'll be as weak as the one who's out there.

170
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Fan Yue, now I'm a human race.

171
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Can you deal with me?

172
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
How dare you threaten me?

173
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

174
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
You dare not?

175
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
You can't?

176
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
You can't.

177
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,040
You let me live until now is proof.

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm not a big person.

179
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
But I have family to protect.

180
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
And I have people to look for.

181
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I did everything not to beg for death, but to beg for life.

182
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Or I can only do those things.

183
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,040
But now I have to make a choice.

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
I'm poisoned today.

185
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm not just a master.

186
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I have the heart of a master.

187
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I can't let go of anything in your heart.

188
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
For the reason I must remember,

189
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
you'll give me what I want.

190
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
This thing is a herb.

191
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,040
It's a cure for the poison.

192
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,040
But the poison is a poison that can cure the demon.

193
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
It's a cure for the poison.

194
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
It can only suppress and prevent.

195
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
If you want to maintain humanity,

196
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
you must use it every day.

197
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Do you understand?

198
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
How to make a flower out of this thing?

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
People's blood.

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
A lot of blood.

201
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Use your own or others.

202
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Kill yourself or others.

203
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
What will you choose?

204
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Use humanity.

205
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Fengyuan, can I trust you?

206
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
You said the mercy in the Moon Shadow Sea was your own.

207
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Do you think it's true?

208
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
No.

209
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I don't know your mercy.

210
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I don't know who you're looking for in the Moon Shadow Sea.

211
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
But this herb is true.

212
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Believe it or not,

213
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,040
it's up to you.

214
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
If my father finds out,

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I'll come to travel today.

216
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
But if you lie to me again,

217
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
you'll never want to be in the Moon Shadow Sea again.

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

219
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Episode 5

220
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
The Cold Spring Palace

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
must be completed soon.

222
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,040
What exactly does that demon girl mean?

223
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Why did she save me?

224
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
There must be a plan in the demon girl's form.

225
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Let's report to the Blue Spirit first.

226
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

227
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Episode 5

228
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

229
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Episode 6

230
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

231
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Episode 7

232
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

233
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Episode 8

234
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
The human blood.

235
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
A lot of blood.

236
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Use your own or others.

237
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Kill yourself or kill others.

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
What will you do?

239
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Episode 9

240
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040
The Moon Shadow Sea

241
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Episode 9

242
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Master, you're still angry?

243
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Angry?

244
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Why would I be angry?

245
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I remember what you originally thought.

246
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Uncle Bai came to beg you.

247
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
He asked you to drive the horse.

248
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
But now he seems to be stuck again.

249
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I...

250
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Master, you're being too kind.

251
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
You're not being too humble.

252
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
He's the one who's been helping you.

253
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Enough!

254
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Master, you've also been poisoned.

255
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
The poison can't be cured.

256
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
He'll have to rely on human blood all his life.

257
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm just thinking about him.

258
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
I don't care how he lives.

259
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
If he saved someone with the grass,

260
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
you'll have no more to think about.

261
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
The grass is just a antidote.

262
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Human nature is my weakness.

263
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
If you keep on doing this,

264
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
you'll have to fight for your life.

265
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,040
The grass will also be a tool to kill people.

266
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Uncle Bai, you're jealous of me.

267
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I want to see

268
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
how you'll get your revenge

269
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
if you're jealous.

270
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Old man,

271
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
you should sleep well.

272
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
When you wake up...

273
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
When you wake up,

274
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm not sure what will happen.

275
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
But I won't let you die.

276
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
We'll have to wait for A-xi to come back

277
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
and reunite with his family.

278
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
But this family

279
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
won't have to start over.

280
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
He...

281
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Forget it.

282
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
It's all about happiness.

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Without him,

284
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
we can live well.

285
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,040
I really don't want to die.

286
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I remember

287
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
those things

288
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
that I didn't get to keep for ten years.

289
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
If I'm smart,

290
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I can be stupid.

291
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
It's just a hundred years

292
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
since the mortal beast was killed.

293
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I'm afraid I'll die.

294
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
But I'm afraid I won't be able to repay him.

295
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
So I can use you

296
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
and not expose your identity.

297
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
But you have to exchange it

298
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
as I want.

299
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
You are the one I want.

300
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm willing to live.

301
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm willing to die.

302
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Please wait for me.

303
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I want to stay for a while.

304
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Who says that I'm a good person?

305
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I must be a good person.

306
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I'm willing to die.

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I've checked the death of a few disciples.

308
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
The other one is the demon.

309
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
It's even more strange.

310
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
The people who killed the disciples

311
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
are all gone.

312
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
How lucky!

313
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I've told you before

314
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
that the demons are the ones who should be killed.

315
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You're talking about me.

316
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I didn't do it.

317
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Chongzhao.

318
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
What's wrong?

319
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Why are you hurt?

320
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
You killed the demon too?

321
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Chongzhao is guilty.

322
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
What's wrong?

323
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Chongzhao was killed by the demon.

324
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
He was killed by the demon.

325
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
But Nian'an City was destroyed by the cold palace.

326
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
The whole city was in chaos.

327
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Chongzhao was killed by the demon.

328
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
He was punished by the Immortal Sect.

329
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
He was punished by the Immortal Sect.

330
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
He was killed by the demon.

331
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Why are you so stupid?

332
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Because if the Immortal Sect killed Nian'an City

333
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
there would be another innocent person.

334
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Chongzhao was protecting the city.

335
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
He was protecting the person.

336
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
He was given the demon opportunity

337
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
to take revenge for Nian'an City.

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Chongzhao was punished by the demon.

339
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I'm begging you.

340
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Don't hurt Uncle Bai.

341
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Uncle Bai?

342
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
What's the relationship between Uncle Bai and you?

343
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Because...

344
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm telling you the truth.

345
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Dad, you're okay now.

346
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
It's good that you're okay.

347
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
It's good that you're okay.

348
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Why don't you talk?

349
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Why are you looking at me so seriously?

350
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,040
People in the house said that you saved me with a flower.

351
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
What flower is that?

352
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
How did you get it?

353
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Flowers are flowers.

354
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Someone found it.

355
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
I don't know what it is.

356
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I don't know how much you have.

357
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
The whole city can't cure the disease.

358
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
You suddenly want to get sick.

359
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
What's going on?

360
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Tell me.

361
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I tried to save you.

362
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
You didn't have the guts to touch me.

363
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
You came to me and cured me.

364
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I told you that you didn't believe me.

365
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,040
What kind of answer can make you satisfied?

366
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
The outside world is in chaos.

367
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Many people have the disease.

368
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
It's not the time for you to be selfish.

369
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
If we really have the medicine, we can get it out and save people.

370
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
If we know anything else, we can tell them all.

371
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm a star.

372
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
What do you want to hear?

373
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
You didn't believe what I said just now.

374
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
No.

375
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
It's not that I said you didn't believe me.

376
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
You never believed me in these years.

377
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
I said that you never believed me.

378
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
You don't have to care about your life.

379
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Don't care about me.

380
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Cheng Rong is in trouble.

381
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
I was in a hurry.

382
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I wanted to ask you about the medicine.

383
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Why did you become so weak overnight?

384
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Shu Er.

385
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
This is not easy.

386
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I don't want anything to happen to you.

387
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
You should rest.

388
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
We'll talk later.

389
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I don't want to say it.

390
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
But the medicine is the medicine.

391
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
It's a matter of life.

392
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
What can I say?

393
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Watch carefully.

394
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Put your eyes on it.

395
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Put your eyes on it.

396
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,040
The soldiers in Yicheng are all dead.

397
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
What do you think?

398
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Stop.

399
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
General.

400
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
How is the city?

401
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
General Yan An ordered that most of the people who were in the city

402
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
were locked in the city's wilderness.

403
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
But there are more people in the city.

404
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
We can't hold them back.

405
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Now we can only let the people who are unharmed stay at home.

406
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Now only the people in the city are safe.

407
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Don't worry.

408
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
The city has regained its cleanliness.

409
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,040
It must have a way to deal with the wildfires.

410
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
At this time, the people can't be confused.

411
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
The city has regained its cleanliness?

412
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
That's great.

413
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
I can't believe it's a wildfire.

414
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
What kind of god will hold the position?

415
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Thank goodness, Miss Er.

416
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
She found the medicine.

417
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I didn't expect Miss Er to be so good.

418
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I really can't tell.

419
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Miss Er, you're the one who can change the rules.

420
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Keep the house gate.

421
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Yes.

422
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Shizhen.

423
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
How is it?

424
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Although Bai Shou has been at home,

425
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Fan Yue is very strict.

426
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
If he takes the time to take the time,

427
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm afraid it's not right.

428
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
But just now, Xi Xi heard a news.

429
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Someone said that Bai Shou has found the medicine

430
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
and has removed the poison from Bai Xun.

431
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Only the grass can remove the poison.

432
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,040
And the grass is left to the demon.

433
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,040
It seems that Fan Yue's arm is the one.

434
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,040
If so, then just push him.

435
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Push?

436
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
The poison is poisonous and it's very dangerous.

437
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Who wouldn't want to get the antidote?

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Tell you the truth.

439
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
It's a human heart.

440
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm not afraid that we'll be helpless.

441
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm afraid that you'll have me.

442
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,040
It's like a broken heart.

443
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,040
If everyone knows that Bai Shou has the antidote,

444
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,040
then he can't leave the path of life.

445
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Since the time of the five-leaf stone has been decided,

446
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,040
it's hard to take the time to take the time.

447
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Then I want to see

448
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,040
if he died because of other reasons,

449
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
the five-leaf stone can't be used.

450
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Will he come out on his own?

451
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I understand.

452
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I'll go now.

453
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
The cold-blooded princess has come from far away.

454
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
She didn't come to my house.

455
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
She hid here.

456
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Could it be...

457
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
she's afraid?

458
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
The Hall of Moon Sect has been

459
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
for many years since the Immortal Clan's death.

460
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
But she's been hiding here.

461
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
She's been hiding here for many years.

462
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
She's been hiding here for many years.

463
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
She's been hiding here for many years.

464
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,040
She's been hiding here for many years.

465
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
She's been hiding here for many years.

466
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
But she's been hiding here for many years.

467
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Could it be that she's been hurt by rumors?

468
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,040
She's been in the grave of the five-leaf stone.

469
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
She's been hurt?

470
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Bai Shou is from my palace.

471
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
How dare you touch her?

472
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Give her some grass.

473
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Send her to death.

474
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
I really didn't see

475
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
that you were protecting her.

476
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I don't need it.

477
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I can't even use it

478
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
to make you understand.

479
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Let's go out!

480
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Bai Shou, come out!

481
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Calm down!

482
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
The City Leader will find a way to solve it.

483
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
City Leader, you have the power.

484
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Why don't you let us go?

485
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Come out!

486
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
What happened?

487
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
I don't know why

488
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
you suddenly broke into the house.

489
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
The people who hid in the house

490
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
all came to beg for medicine.

491
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
And she said that

492
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
the City Leader's group of drug

493
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
didn't want to give it to the people.

494
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
City Leader!

495
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
What can you hear?

496
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Say it in a word.

497
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
City Leader, please give us the medicine.

498
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Please save us!

499
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
City Leader, please save us!

500
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Please save us!

501
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Who told you this?

502
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Everyone said that

503
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
the City Leader found the medicine.

504
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
And someone asked us to come here to beg for medicine.

505
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Now there are more and more people in the crowd.

506
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Please pity the City Leader.

507
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Please give us the medicine.

508
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
The medicine is from our girl.

509
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
The City Leader's house

510
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
really doesn't have any fish.

511
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
City Leader, please let the City Leader

512
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
come out and help us.

513
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Yes, City Leader.

514
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Don't worry, everyone.

515
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I won't let anyone in.

516
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Please believe me.

517
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Give me more time.

518
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
I will send people to find the medicine.

519
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
No matter how difficult it is,

520
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I will give you an explanation.

521
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
City Leader, please wait for 20 minutes.

522
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You must come out.

523
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Don't be nervous.

524
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Don't forget to take the strategy.

525
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Please believe me.

526
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Go home first.

527
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Don't be so anxious.

528
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
If you want to solve this,

529
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
you must rely on everyone.

530
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Bai Xun is waiting.

531
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I promise you.

532
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Good luck.

533
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
What's wrong with City Leader?

534
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
City Leader.

535
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm fine.

536
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Second Younger Sister fainted suddenly.

537
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Bai Yu.

538
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Everyone, calm down.

539
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Don't panic.

540
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
What's wrong?

541
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
What's wrong with Shuo Er?

542
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I sold her to Second Younger Sister.

543
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
She was so angry.

544
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
I think she lost too much

545
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
due to my experience.

546
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
She lost too much?

547
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
You haven't been in the army for a long time.

548
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
You won't be able to do it.

549
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I just didn't rest well last night.

550
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
City Leader, I'll tell you

551
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
that I'm leaving.

552
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Your uncle is guarding Ning An City with me.

553
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
He's been standing there for a long time.

554
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
He's experienced it.

555
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
He can't be wrong.

556
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Tell me the truth.

557
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
How did you get the medicine?

558
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Why did you become so weak?

559
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
You still don't believe me.

560
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
I don't believe you.

561
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
It's just that the people are in a mess.

562
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
If you can't find the medicine,

563
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Ning An City will...

564
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Who did it?

565
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
It's okay. I was hurt by accident.

566
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
You don't have to worry about it.

567
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Shuo Er, can you tell me the truth?

568
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm your father.

569
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Even if you're angry with me,

570
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
there's nothing you can't say.

571
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Father, don't ask me.

572
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Even if you're the City Leader,

573
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
you can't solve some problems.

574
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Okay, you won't tell me, right?

575
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I'll ask Chong Zhao.

576
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
He's always with you.

577
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I'll see

578
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
which one of you dare to touch my daughter

579
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
with a bear heart.

580
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Father!

581
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
The medicine is against the law.

582
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
If Chong Zhao finds out,

583
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
I'm afraid he'll destroy Youcao.

584
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
I'll go and get the poison.

585
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
I'll go.

586
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Youcao is a good person.

587
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
He can suppress the disease.

588
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Every day, he can use a flower.

589
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
He can't stop it.

590
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Chong Zhao, you can't!

591
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
You're lying!

592
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
It's not the medicine!

593
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
It's my daughter's life.

594
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm the City Leader.

595
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
But I can't help but be in trouble.

596
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm a man's father.

597
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
But I can't stop my daughter

598
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
from writing and making trouble.

599
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Aiyu, it's not the medicine.

600
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
It's Shuo Er's blood.

601
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I'll keep it every day.

602
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
It's my daughter's blood!

603
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I'll keep it every day.

604
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
But City Leader,

605
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
this is the only way to solve the problem.

606
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
He's already solved the problem.

607
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
If we give the master a piece of paper,

608
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
he'll solve the problem soon.

609
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
If we need to kill the boss first,

610
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm willing to do it.

611
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
It's useless!

612
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
It's useless.

613
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
City Leader,

614
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
why did you do this?

615
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
You Cao can only be buried.

616
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
He can't be cured.

617
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
This is the root of the root.

618
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
It's a life for life!

619
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Bai Yu,

620
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
you've never seen

621
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
what kind of person you are.

622
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
You should know that once the medicine is distributed,

623
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
someone will be able to afford it.

624
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Then you'll be able to make a bigger money.

625
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
You can't do anything about it.

626
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
You can't do anything about it.

627
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Then you'll be able to make a bigger money.

628
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
By then,

629
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
it won't be a big mess.

630
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Instead,

631
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
you'll be killed.

632
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Young people are always crazy.

633
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I'll tell you soon

634
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
that everything is impossible to do.

635
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
One broken bridge

636
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
will never be a good idea.

637
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
No matter how hard it is,

638
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
how can you

639
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
make it not easy?

640
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Don't worry.

641
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
It's not a big mess.

642
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
You'll be able to do whatever you want.

643
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
By then,

644
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
you'll know

645
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
what it means to be not easy.

646
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
You want to use it.

647
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
It's not just Lan Ling.

648
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Even though the old man is annoying,

649
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
he's not a fool

650
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
for a thousand years.

651
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Such a lowly man.

652
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
They won't be able to see through it.

653
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Do you think I can only use

654
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
the fairy door?

655
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
What else have you done?

656
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
The play is ready.

657
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Just watch the play.

658
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
You have the ambition.

659
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Then I'll use your blood

660
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
to give this play a bright color.

661
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Wake up and play.

662
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,540
[? Qingyao ?]

663
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Why is your shoulderoughing like this?

664
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
You don't feel well.

665
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
Well,

666
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
me and Master Zhao

667
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
have to let it go.

668
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
There are so many things happening recently.

669
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
I forgot about this big day.

670
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,680
Old man, don't be sad.

671
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
I've changed your gift.

672
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll go get it.

673
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,040
What gift?

674
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,120
Which one of the money you spent was not given by me?

675
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
The whole flower-like thing,

676
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,080
why don't you try to sit down and eat with me?

677
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Where's Chongzhao?

678
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,640
I haven't seen him for a few days. Where did he go?

679
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,840
Maybe he's in the secret shop.

680
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Is there anything wrong?

681
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,480
Who dares to buy a secret shop at this time?

682
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,760
Don't worry.

683
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
I'll send someone to look for him.

684
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,080
Father, he won't be in trouble.

685
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,400
How do you know?

686
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
He's in a mess.

687
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,240
He's in a mess.

688
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
He can't even take the knife.

689
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,320
Anyway, you trust me.

690
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,520
Chongzhao is fine.

691
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,000
Those people can't hurt him.

692
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,120
You've grown up so soon.

693
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,160
You have your own secret.

694
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Okay, I trust you.

695
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
If you don't say, I won't ask.

696
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,800
Chongzhao is a good boy.

697
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,520
I trust him.

698
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,320
He promised me to take good care of you.

699
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,720
I don't need him to take care of me.

700
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,520
You never thought about it.

701
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Even if I'm not married,

702
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
I can still be nice to you.

703
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Bullshit.

704
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,040
You're talking about those who don't know the truth.

705
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,200
Fine, fine.

706
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,240
You're a young man.

707
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
You're the eldest.

708
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
I won't be mad at you today.

709
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,280
I heard that

710
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,040
there's a public trouble in the second floor.

711
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,200
What did you just say?

712
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,640
Can the people be in trouble?

713
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
They're afraid to ask about the situation.

714
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,440
But you're so stupid.

715
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,880
How did you get it?

716
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,200
Don't let the people lie.

717
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,480
There are many things in the world.

718
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,920
It's not a big deal.

719
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
I'm the one who was saved by the immortal.

720
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,080
It's not easy to find a grass.

721
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
You're here today?

722
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,360
I asked the immortal.

723
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,640
You didn't scold me.

724
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,840
You want to scold me?

725
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You didn't always think I was a god.

726
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,520
You didn't even say a word to me.

727
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,640
How many times did you use

728
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
to learn this?

729
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
What?

730
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
You're a newbie?

731
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Shu'er.

732
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I know you've suffered a lot.

733
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,640
In these years,

734
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,960
people in the city always mock you and dig you up.

735
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I even know that

736
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,800
you've never told me those things.

737
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,560
You only know that

738
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,160
you're hiding under the tree

739
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,440
planted by your mother.

740
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,760
You're crying secretly.

741
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,200
You don't want to tell me

742
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,080
that it's because I never stood by you.

743
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,480
I never said I believed you and supported you.

744
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,360
I didn't help you to drive away those who mock you.

745
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,720
I just helped them to shut you up.

746
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,400
Why are you suddenly thinking about these things?

747
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Shu'er.

748
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,000
I have a story for you.

749
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,480
There was a city owner who was lucky in life.

750
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,880
He married his beloved girl, Wei Qi.

751
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,760
After three years of marriage,

752
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,440
his wife, Xin'er,

753
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,560
gave birth to two very cute girls.

754
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,440
But she didn't believe it.

755
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,160
She was ill for a few years.

756
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,600
The owner was in a bad mood.

757
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,640
She was in a bad mood.

758
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,920
She must have raised two girls safely.

759
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,720
But she lost two girls

760
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,160
ten years ago.

761
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,920
The owner sent troops to find them everywhere.

762
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,360
She almost turned Ning'an city into a suburb.

763
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,440
Eventually, she found her daughter

764
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,240
in the chaotic forest outside the city.

765
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,120
But at that time,

766
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,520
she also saw the ideal of making her life difficult.

767
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Miss.

768
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,960
Xin'er.

769
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,000
Second Miss.

770
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Shu'er.

771
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,680
Second Miss.

772
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,760
Second Miss.

773
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,880
Second Miss.

774
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,440
Xin'er.

775
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Second Miss.

776
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Shu'er.

777
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Shu'er.

778
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Xin'er.

779
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Xin'er.

780
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,840
Shu'er.

781
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,640
Xin'er.

782
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Master.

783
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Xin'er.

784
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
Tonight,

785
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,000
Miss lost her way in the city.

786
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,960
She delayed her return.

787
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,920
The thing next to her

788
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,760
has never happened.

789
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Clear?

790
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
Yes, Master.

791
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Master.

792
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Father.

793
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Shu'er.

794
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I saw Ziyue that time.

795
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I believe you.

796
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,280
I believe in the world.

797
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,160
Why didn't you say it all these years?

798
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,360
Because I am the owner.

799
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,920
The owner of the city

800
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,160
is not only to protect the people,

801
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,240
but also to stabilize the people.

802
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,480
In the city, everyone can smoke

803
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,320
and smoke.

804
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
I can't do that.

805
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,280
I can only live and die.

806
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
I can only live and die.

807
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,040
I can only live and die.

808
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,400
I have to live and die.

809
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,800
I have to work hard.

810
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,400
If I am to be killed,

811
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,480
if I am to be killed,

812
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,720
if I am to be killed,

813
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,440
the people will be confused.

814
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
No matter how much I believe in you,

815
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I can't stand by you.

816
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,800
I can't say that.

817
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I believe in you.

818
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,360
Why did you tell me now?

819
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,200
Because I want to do something.

820
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
You will object to it,

821
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
but I will do it.

822
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,280
I just want to tell you.

823
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,280
I love you

824
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,280
and I believe in you.

825
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
What do you want to do?

826
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Old man,

827
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I tell you.

828
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
You can't make me angry.

829
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Otherwise, I will not forgive you.

830
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
Shuo'er,

831
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
live well.

832
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
What happened?

833
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
You...

834
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
You...

835
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
You scared me.

836
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Sleep.

837
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Sleep well.

838
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Sleep well.

839
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
Everything is fine.

840
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Old man.

841
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Chief, Miss Jiang'er,

842
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
please leave the city quickly.

843
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Chief, Old man.

844
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
This is my mission.

845
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I will do anything to make it.

846
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Yes.

847
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Father,

848
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
don't do it.

849
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Come out.

850
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Come out.

851
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Come out.

852
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Don't come out.

853
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Come out.

854
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Don't come out.

855
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Come out.

856
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Calm down.

857
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Chief is trying to solve the problem.

858
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
He is not what you think.

859
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Don't come out.

860
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Don't come out.

861
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Calm down.

862
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Calm down.

863
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Chief is trying to solve the problem.

864
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Please give him more time.

865
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Thank you for your help.

866
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Chief, Chief.

867
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Chief,

868
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Chief, Chief.

869
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Chief, Chief.

870
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Chief.

871
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Chief,

872
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
you can't hold it.

873
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
The people are outside.

874
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Chief,

875
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
This...

876
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Bai Yu.

877
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Do you still remember this sword?

878
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Yes.

879
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,280
This was given to you by the whole city.

880
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,280
I remember that year, Ning'an City was destroyed by bandits.

881
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I took your brothers and wrote a letter and fought for half a year to destroy the bandits.

882
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,280
The people found a piece of iron to build this sword for me.

883
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,280
I've been loyal to him for all these years.

884
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,280
To be honest, that little rabbit always likes to make swords.

885
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,280
He often touched my room and stole a lot of things from me.

886
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,280
He even made me a long time friend.

887
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,280
That time, Miss A liked it.

888
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
She didn't understand your hard work.

889
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,280
She didn't know that the sword is precious,

890
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
it doesn't have any value,

891
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
and it has a heart.

892
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,280
The whole city is not just a sword,

893
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,280
but a safety.

894
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Bai Yu, I've protected this city for 20 years.

895
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Let me protect it again.

896
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,280
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,280
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,280
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,280
I'm sorry.

900
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm sorry.

901
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm sorry.

902
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,280
I'm sorry.

903
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,280
I'm sorry.

904
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm sorry.

905
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
I'm sorry.

906
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,280
I'm sorry.

907
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I'm sorry.

908
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,280
I'm sorry.

909
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I'm sorry.

910
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Thank you.

911
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Oh, you are the light I long for

912
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,280
It's the lonely pain

913
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Let it be at this moment

914
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:29,280
I want to be with you

915
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:37,280
I want to be with you

916
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:46,280
You are the blue earth I long for

917
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,280
Let tears be filled

918
00:46:52,280 --> 00:47:00,280
I want to be with you
