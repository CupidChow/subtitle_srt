1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 21]

19
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,340
Young Lord,

20
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,130
why didn't you tell Chong Zhao

21
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,410
about the forehead mark?

22
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,340
The forehead mark just flashed by.

23
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,140
I didn't see what exactly it was.

24
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,890
We're going back to the Cold Spring Palace tomorrow.

25
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,550
Let's not complicate things.

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
I understand.

27
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,140
Then, I won't say anything, either.

28
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,770
But, today in the Fox Clan,

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,010
you could have killed Bai Shuo.

30
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,300
Why did you go easy on her?

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,730
It's not that I went easy on her,

32
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,990
but

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,440
I saw her dagger.

34
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,180
It's not the first time you saw that dagger.

35
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,340
But this was the first time

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,140
that the dagger looked familiar to me.

37
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,850
I also saw some images.

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I always feel

39
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,280
I've seen that dagger before.

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,450
What images?

41
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
I can't remember.

42
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,490
Young Lord,

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,890
you have headaches and see things.

44
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,430
Could you be sick?

45
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,570
See things?

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,280
Young Lord, don't worry.

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,530
We'll be back at the Cold Spring Palace tomorrow.

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm going to find Chen Ye.

49
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,840
Although he is bad,

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,110
he has a lot of good medicine.

51
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,890
There must be medicine for headaches.

52
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,860
Yes.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Tomorrow,

54
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,330
we're going back to the Cold Spring Palace.

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,130
One must remain calm when practicing swordsmanship.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,760
I just want to be stronger

57
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,560
so that I won't be a burden to the people around me.

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,750
I caused you to lose your star in Outlanders' City.

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,720
Now, I've caused Mu Jiu's death.

60
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,330
It was Mu Jiu's choice.

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,790
He didn't do it just for you.

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,780
Tian Huo,

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,030
about Mu Jiu…

64
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,770
Master Fan, don't worry.

65
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,909
I understand.

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,740
Back then, you lost much of your spiritual power in Rong Xian's realm of resentment

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,450
and saved Mu Jiu against fate.

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
Now, Mu Jiu

69
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,350
sacrificed himself for everyone.

70
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,480
I think

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,870
he felt the same

72
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,620
as when you saved him.

73
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,760
He didn't resent

74
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,210
or try to ask for anything in return.

75
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,010
Am I right?

76
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,440
Fate is full of tricks.

77
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,830
I feel sorry that the one who'll be beside you

78
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,430
will only be this little fox.

79
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,590
Mu Jiu is in my heart

80
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,380
and everyone else's.

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,820
I've sent a letter to Jingyou Mountain.

82
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,840
Now, the Emotion Tree is growing vigorously.

83
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,640
The Fox Clan thrives.

84
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,370
They will always remember

85
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,630
it's Mu Jiu who used his life

86
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,830
to pave the future path for them.

87
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,460
What about Master Chang Mei?

88
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,640
She has been stuck guarding the Fox Clan for 1,000 years.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,590
Now that the crisis of the Emotion Tree has been lifted,

90
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,320
will she be leaving or staying?

91
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,880
This time,

92
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,409
she still chose to stay.

93
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,190
All of you

94
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,980
have left yourselves here.

♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,930

99

I'll stay in the Fox Clan

the real freedom is not just about where you are,

I haven't looked at Jingyou Mountain seriously again.

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,760
to work for free in the Unbridled Pavilion.

172
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,750
Washing clothes, cooking meals—

173
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,780
I can do anything.

174
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,410
You can just order me around.

175
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,260
Huo,

176
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
my feelings for you are real.

177
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,070
If love fills your heart

178
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,200
as you look at me,

179
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,290
then your touch on the Emotion Tree

180
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,830
will make it bloom with flowers.

181
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,950
The world is vast.

182
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,230
It's a long way ahead.

183
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,900
Promise me.

184
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,350
no matter what happens in the future,

185
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,970
just be happy and free

186
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,750
like just now.

187
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,190
Come out.

188
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,610
I...

189
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,970
I just want to

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,040
make you happy.

191
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,450
I'm not unhappy.

192
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,180
Mu Jiu left. That's it.

193
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,070
You don't have to do this anymore.

194
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,060
I just want to do

196
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,410
what Mu Jiu told me.

197
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,340
What did he tell you to do?

198
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,540
Mu Jiu stopped me in the forest that day.

199
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,230
It's a wide path.

200
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,920
Why do you have to block my way?

201
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,900
Silly Stone.

202
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,680
Promise me something.

203
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,480
If I'm gone one day,

204
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,470
take good care of Huo for me.

205
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,530
Do you hear me?

206
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,530
Of course.

207
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,960
Wait.

208
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,800
What do you mean by "gone"?

209
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,500
Where are you going?

210
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Huo seems

211
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,850
not to care about anything,

212
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,090
but she's actually the most loyal.

213
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,400
She is tough

214
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,560
and strong-willed.

215
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,150
In the future,

216
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,350
be more tolerant of her.

217
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,070
I'm leaving.

218
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,440
I...

219
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,600
I don't want to replace Mu Jiu.

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,310
I...

221
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,050
just want to make you happy.

222
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,450
I know

223
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,810
you always keep everything in your heart.

224
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,400
I heard everything you said

225
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,560
to comfort Bai Shuo.

226
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,540
You said you no longer dwell on it,

227
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,960
but I know

228
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,850
you haven't let it go deep inside.

229
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,550
Cang Shan.

230
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,400
Thank you.

231
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,970
I'll walk out of it slowly.

232
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,260
Isn't this your forbidden place?

233
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,580
Follow me.

234
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,890
Those names represent

235
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,400
Master Fan's deceased clan members.

236
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,990
I, Bai Shuo,

237
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,300
greet you.

238
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,550
You know this?

239
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,480
The last time your Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal acted up,

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,010
Tian Huo told me about this.

241
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,870
These are your clan members.

242
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,320
If they were still alive,

243
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,030
they would like you very much.

244
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,280
[Gu Shang]

245
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,520
This is my grandfather.

246
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,020
This is my brother.

247
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,510
Qi Feng.

248
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,220
Everyone says that

249
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,140
the Demon King of the Polar Region

250
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,610
has a mysterious background.

251
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,640
No one knows who I am

252
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,950
or where I came from.

253
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,100
That's because they don't know

254
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,250
that the Baize clan that they thought had been eliminated

255
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,180
has actually not been eliminated.

256
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,640
Baize Clan?

257
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,290
I want to tell you my story.

258
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,070
Is that okay?

259
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,100
If it's too sad,

260
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,670
you can tell me later.

261
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,900
I want to tell you now.

262
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,700
I just want to tell you.

263
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,640
Ten years ago,

264
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,270
I went up the mountain to collect herbs

265
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,990
and fell off the cliff,

266
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,100
but I survived.

267
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,190
However,

268
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,990
I lost my memory.

269
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,570
When I woke up, I found out that

270
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,670
I was the grandson of the Chief of the Baize Clan.

271
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,820
I had a younger brother,

272
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,040
[Qi Feng]

273
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,700
Qi Feng.

274
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,970
Soon, I became a part of this big family again.

275
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,480
Although our life was ordinary,

276
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,470
but it was carefree.

277
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,290
But one day,

278
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,350
the Tiger Clan broke in

279
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,000
and surrounded all the people of the Baize Clan.

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,490
They asked Grandfather

281
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,660
for one child.

282
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,660
I'll say it again.

283
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,880
Hand over the child with purple pupils.

284
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,720
[Wang Hu, Demon Race]

285
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,310
All the clan members are here.

286
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,060
Take a look.

287
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,430
There's no child with purple pupils.

288
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,400
Still denying it?

289
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,070
Since you said no,

290
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,860
then,

291
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,030
we'll start killing

292
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,750
until

293
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,000
you are willing to hand him over.

294
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,490
Kill!

295
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,040
Stop!

296
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,020
Stop!

297
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,180
I'll hand him over.

298
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,330
I will.

299
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,880
Grandfather.

300
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,180
Grandfather.

301
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,550
Why?

302
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,600
Qi Feng!

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,760
Qi Feng!

304
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,850
Grandfather!

305
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,030
Why?

306
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,940
Qi Feng!

307
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,310
Qi Feng!

308
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,330
Since

309
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,860
the child has been found,

310
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,680
the Baize Clan will be…

311
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,940
killed!

312
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,460
The Tiger Clan found the child,

313
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,990
but they still wanted to kill your whole clan!

314
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,270
How did you

315
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,640
survive back then?

316
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,820
That day,

317
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,360
the Baize Clan was turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.

318
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,560
The Tiger Clan thought we were all dead,

319
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,960
so they left.

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,710
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

346
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,610
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

347
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,990
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

348
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,130
Grandfather!

349
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,290
Grandfather!

350
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,880
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

351
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,050
Grandfather!

352
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,100
Grandfather!

353
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,990
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

354
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,830
Grandfather!

355
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,340
Grandfather!

356
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,270
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

357
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,060
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

358
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,940
Grandfather…

359
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,720
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

360
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,230
I was almost dead.

361
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,590
Grandfather gave me all his spiritual power

362
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,680
and saved my life.

363
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,550
So later,

364
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,300
you forced yourself to cultivate to avenge them.

365
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,380
That's why you got the backlash of the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

366
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,370
Yes.

367
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,200
Then, have you…

368
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,150
had your revenge?

369
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,110
When I finally became stronger

370
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,330
and found the Tiger Clan,

371
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,460
the Tiger Clan was already destroyed,

372
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,550
and Qi Feng was nowhere to be found.

373
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,870
I'm afraid he's already dead.

374
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,580
It has been a long time,

375
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,910
but every time I think about it,

376
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,710
I feel...

377
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,630
Fan Yue.

378
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm here.

379
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,090
Grandfather.

380
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,620
Qi Feng.

381
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,260
Her name is Bai Shuo. She's the person I like.

382
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,580
I brought her to see you today.

383
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,490
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

384
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm Bai Shuo.

385
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,690
Greetings, Grandfather.

386
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,990
The last time I saw you,

387
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,370
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

388
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,470
I didn't know who you were.

389
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm sorry to have offended you.

390
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,240
Please forgive me.

391
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,650
Fan Yue is the person I like.

392
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,590
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

393
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,800
Don't worry.

394
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,150
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

395
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,410
From now on, I'll be with him,

396
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,950
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

397
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,130
take care of him,

398
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,580
and protect him.

399
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,200
I won't let him get sick,

400
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,050
get hurt,

401
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,910
or be sad.

402
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,420
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

403
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,310
I'll be with him

404
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
forever

405
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,390
and ever.

406
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,470
♫All the answers are already explained♫

407
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
I brought you here today

408
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,270
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

409
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,720
to tell you everything about me.

410
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,210
I want you to understand

411
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,010
♫But we're destined to part♫

412
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
that I've taken you as my family.

413
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,660
No matter what danger you face in the future,

414
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,900
♫How can I downplay this?♫

415
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,440
I'll face it with you.

416
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,060
So, don't blame yourself for my losing stars.

417
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,810
Losing stars is for our life together.

418
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,930
But if the stars are all gone,

419
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,420
you will die.

420
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,610
Find life through facing death.

421
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,540
Isn't this what you always do?

422
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,910
Fan Yue.

423
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,310
Stop joking.

424
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,850
I'm not.

425
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
I want to live with you,

426
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,470
without talking about who owes who

427
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,500
or weighing the pros and cons.

428
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay?

429
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,060
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

430
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,600
♫When my star falls only for you♫

431
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,500
When the Baize Clan was destroyed,

432
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,940
♫When the heavens fall♫

433
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,170
you lost your most loved ones.

434
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,470
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

435
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,420
From a young boy to the current Demon King,

436
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,680
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

437
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,600
all the people in the world only see your brilliant light,

438
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,240
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

439
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,560
but they don't know

440
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,630
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

441
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,650
how much hardship you've been through.

442
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,210
It doesn't matter anymore.

443
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,650
The bitterness and hardship

444
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,670
have all passed.

445
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,130
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

446
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,420
No,

447
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,860
they haven't yet.

448
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,980
♫When my star falls only for you♫

449
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,450
If the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal is not resolved,

450
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,040
how can you be safe?

451
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,220
♫When the heavens fall♫

452

♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

453
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,130
Fan Yue.

454
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,540
I will try my best to become stronger

455
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,230
and gather the Five Contemplations as soon as possible.

456
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,170
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

457
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,060
You will live well

458
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
as your grandfather wished.

459
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,620
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

♫As you turn into a falling star♫

461
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,970
Grand Master,

462
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,590
I could have brought back

463
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,810
the Contemplation Stone from the Jingyou Mountain,

464
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,160
but unexpectedly,

465
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,210
Bai Shuo could summon the divine sword from the Outlander King's Ring.

466
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,610
That's why I failed the mission.

467
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,560
If Lord Chong Zhao hadn't saved me,

468
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,660
I

469
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,450
may have been killed already.

470
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,450
You said the defeat of the Outlanders' City

471
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,170
was because Fan Yue

472
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,060
suddenly regained his spiritual power.

473
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,090
Now, you said the failure of the Jingyou Mountain mission

474
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,890
was because Bai Shuo

475
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,510
summoned the divine sword.

476
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,770
You have so many excuses.

477
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,160
But you

478
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,660
only have one life!

479
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,760
What I said

480
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,850
is all true.

481
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
I dare not lie.

482
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,050
Master,

483
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,190
what Lady Fu Ling said is true.

484
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,360
The wound on Chong Zhao

485
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,760
was caused by the Outlander King's Sword.

486
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,230
You can check it.

487
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,430
There is the Contemplation Stone

488
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,910
in Bai Shuo's body,

489
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,190
so it's not surprising

490
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,340
that she could control

491
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,000
the power of the divine sword.

492
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,780
On the contrary,

493
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,930
you know Bai Shuo well.

494
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,590
You still can't bring her back.

495
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,350
Grand Master,

496
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,180
the mission of the Fox Clan failed.

497
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm willing to be punished alone.

498
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,090
Just please

499
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,650
spare my life

500
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,880
so that I can revenge this sword strike.

501
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
One blocked the sword for you

502
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,360
and the other avenged you.

503
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,770
It's really touching.

504
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,500
I just wonder if the friendship

505
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,690
is real

506
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,490
or fake.

507
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,860
What do you want to say?

508
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,220
A few days ago, I went to the Human Race.

509
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,740
Guess who I met.

510
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,690
Jing Lei in Lanling.

511
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,850
Jing Lei led his disciples to patrol,

512
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,700
obviously on guard.

513
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,470
I've never left Cold Spring Palace,

514
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,890
but he could tell that I was from there

515
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,580
just by an evil insect.

516
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,740
Lord Chong Zhao,

517
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,760
do you think

518
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,370
that was a coincidence?

519
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,610
Lanling is responsible for protecting the Human Race.

520
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,810
It's normal for the Eternals to patrol.

521
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,460
Although Lord Chen Ye has never been out of the Cold Spring Palace,

522
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,220
he's been well-known for military craftsmanship.

523
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,250
It's also reasonable that Jing Lei

524
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,990
could tell by the evil insect.

525
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,860
If you are suspicious,

526
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,510
I'm at your disposal.

527
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,100
Whether I'm suspicious

528
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,090
doesn't lie with me,

529
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,200
but with you.

530
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,850
Enough.

531
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,510
I don't want

532
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,860
to see such a…

533
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,620
coincidence again.

534
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,970
You may leave now.

535
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,230
I have something

536
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,720
to talk about with Fu Ling.

537
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,260
Aren't you curious

538
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,150
why Grand Master only kept her?

539
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,990
What place do you take Cold Spring Palace as?

540
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,420
She failed the mission.

541
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,190
Of course, she'll be punished by Grand Master.

542
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,950
Why are you telling me so much?

543
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,510
Whether she's alive or dead

544
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,250
has nothing to do with me.

545
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,890
How heartless.

546
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,690
You're right.

547
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,860
If it weren't for her calculation,

548
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,200
why would you betray the Eternals and become a demon?

549
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,980
In this case, just wait and see.

550
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,610
Look at how pathetic she will be

551
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,690
and how she'll beg for forgiveness.

552
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,220
No.

553
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,320
She never begged for mercy.

554
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,050
If Grand Master gets angry,

555
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,640
she will only suffer more.

556
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,570
I told you.

557
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,230
I don't care about her.

558
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,510
I

559
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,060
left you alone

560
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,380
to give you a chance to talk.

561
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,730
I've finished

562
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,880
what I want to say.

563
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,940
Since you have nothing else to say,

564
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,550
I won't force you.

565
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,380
This

566
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,670
is Heart Devouring Pill.

567
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,840
I give it to you.

568
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,970
Eat it.

569
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,010
What?

570
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,330
You don't like it?

571
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,240
I can forgive you for failing your mission,

572
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,950
but I won't allow you to betray me.

573
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,330
Let me ask you.

574
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,280
Is Chong Zhao

575
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,430
truly loyal to the Cold Spring Palace?

576
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,090
Grand Master, you still don't trust him?

577
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,790
Whether I trust him or not doesn't matter.

578
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,420
Chong Zhao can't stir up much trouble.

579
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,420
What I want is your

580
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,860
absolute loyalty.

581
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,750
Now,

582
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,680
you have started to love someone

583
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,460
and have lost your mind.

584
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,850
One day,

585
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,750
you may betray me.

586
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,690
Instead of waiting for that day,

587
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,020
why not eliminate

588
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,510
the potential threat now?

589
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,230
Grand Master, you saved me, raised me, and taught me.

590
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,270
Everything I have now is given by you, master.

591
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,180
In my heart,

592
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,370
no one is your match.

593
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,190
Fine.

594
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,570
Let it

595
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,460
be one with you.

596
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,300
Then I believe you.

597
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,910
Now, I believe

598
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,440
you won't betray me.

599
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,510
Once

600
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,750
you start taking this pill,

601
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,970
you can't stop it.

602
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,260
If you stop taking it halfway,

603
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,190
the pain

604
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,930
will come every day.

605
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,490
A month after you stop,

606
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,580
you'll succumb to the poison and die.

607
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,570
Remember,

608
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,080
your life

609
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,440
is in my hands.

610
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,840
I

611
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,540
can take it back anytime.

612
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,600
Since you took the blame

613
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,590
for the mistake about the Fox Clan incident,

614
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,930
go to the secret room to receive your punishment.

615
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,290
Thank you…

616
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,770
Grand Master.

617
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,840
This is...

618
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,460
made by

619
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,010
you, Master of Bright Moon?

620
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,380
The last time I cooked

621
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,840
was when I was with the Baize Clan.

622
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,930
After all these years, my skills have grown rusty.

623
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,770
Try it.

624
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,240
Delicious.

625
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,630
The sweetness is just right.

626
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,650
And it is soft.

627
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,730
What's wrong?

628
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,380
In the past,

629
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,710
Xi used to like this kind of cake, too.

630
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,830
Xi?

631
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,900
The sister that has been missing for a long time?

632
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,110
You know her?

633
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,940
Back when I was in Ning'an City,

634
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,270
I found you suspicious,

635
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,730
so I investigated

636
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,750
you and your whole family.

637
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,190
Now, you are honest.

638
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,290
This dagger

639
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
is a birthday gift from Xi.

640
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,080
Even though I can summon the Outlander King's Sword,

641
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,310
I'll still keep this dagger with me.

642
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,610
I'll keep it all my life.

643
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,030
After she left home,

644
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,860
she's never come back even once?

645
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,930
No.

646
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,800
Xi and I grew up together.

647
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,450
I was like a bully,

648
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,010
but she was virtuous and gentle.

649
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,730
After my mother passed away,

650
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,540
my sister, who is only two years older than me,

651
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,340
took care of me like a mother.

652
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,300
This fabric looks amazing for making clothes.

653
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,280
This is also great for making cloaks.

654
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,040
Yes, it's very beautiful.

655
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,220
So ugly.

656
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,370
One year on the Lantern Festival,

657
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,700
I insisted on going out.

658
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,750
Xi couldn't dissuade me,

659
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,270
so she went to the lantern festival with me.

660
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,800
That night,

661
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,570
we met a demon

662
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,430
and were caught and brought outside the city.

663
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,680
Fortunately, we were saved by the benefactor from the Lunar Hidden Sea.

664
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
Not long after we came back,

665
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,130
Xi suddenly fell ill.

666
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,000
It was extremely dangerous.

667
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,110
There was no cure.

668
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,870
Xi.

669
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,960
At that time,

670
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,990
both my father and I were desperate,

671
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,380
until a roaming Taoist passed by Ning'an City

672
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,560
and saved my sister.

673
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,400
That Taoist is highly skilled in medicine.

674
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,220
He said my sister must travel

675
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,610
around the world with him

676
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,060
and recuperate every day to recover fully.

677
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,200
My father had no choice

678
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,770
but to let that Taoist take her away.

679
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,530
Xi!

680
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,360
But after she left,

681
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
there has never been news about her.

682
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,560
Xi!

683
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,520
Father seldom talked about Xi,

684
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,610
but I know

685
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,840
he secretly sent people to look for her many times.

686
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,250
If I hadn't been willful,

687
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,540
Xi wouldn't have had to leave home

688
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
and disappeared.

689
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,760
You were still young then.

690
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,890
You didn't know what would happen.

691
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,020
It's not your fault.

692
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,470
Can I

693
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,460
see my sister again?

694
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,320
Yes.

695
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,550
Trust me.

696
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,460
Young Lord.

697
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,190
Young Lord.

698
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,500
You knew it was poison.

699
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,060
Why did you still eat it?

700
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,430
If I didn't do it,

701
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,010
the punishment given by Grand Master

702
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,410
would be far more vicious than this poison.

703
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,600
What should we do?

704
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,310
I'll get someone to help you!

705
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,100
No!

706
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,560
No one will help me.

707
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,180
I don't need help, either.

708
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,460
Remember,

709
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,070
in the Cold Spring Palace,

710
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,520
once you beg someone,

711
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
you will be judged as weak.

712
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,110
And the fate of the weak

713
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,240
is death.

714
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,410
Young Lord,

715
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,920
I don't want you to die.

716
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,940
I don't want you to live such a miserable life, either.

717
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,520
Why did you come out?

718
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,030
I came out to see

719
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,660
who was working so hard—

720
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,120
practicing swordsmanship in the middle of the night.

721
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,920
Didn't we reach an agreement?

722
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,260
We'll walk together from now on.

723
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,840
I want to be someone who can fight side by side with you.

724
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
That's why I can't live

725
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,770
under your protection.

726
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,450
But you can't rush to succeed.

727
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,570
I know.

728
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,110
But after the Fox Clan's love enters my body,

729
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,840
I feel a little different.

730
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,690
How?

731
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,260
I feel that

732
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,750
some kind of power is gradually growing within me.

733
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,090
It's not the external power of the Outlander King's Sword,

734
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,350
but an internal force that grows inside…

735
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,690
I'm not sure what it is.

736
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
The Contemplation Stone sucked three Contemplations

737
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,690
and actually generated spiritual power in your body.

738
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,540
Spiritual power?

739
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,679
Concentrate,

740
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,989
transport the power you feel into your energy base,

741
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,790
and then transfer it to the palm.

742
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,929
This is the spiritual power?

743
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,050
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

744
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,810
It's my own spiritual power?

745
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,340
Back then in the Demon Race,

746
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,850
you couldn't cultivate the demonic power.

747
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,929
So, I sent you to the Old Turtle to learn.

748
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,239
♫All the answers are already explained♫

749
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
But there's one thing

750
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,530
I can teach you.

751
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,100
What?

752
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,940
If you fight with a strong opponent

753
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,150
and your power is weaker than him,

754
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,060
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

755
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,530
you can use the fastest speed

756
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,389
to strike when least expected

757
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,270
and target his weak spot.

758
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
♫But we're destined to part♫

759
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,870
As long as you can catch his only flaw,

760
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,390
one strike will be fatal,

761
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,830
♫How can I downplay this?♫

762
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,070
considered a finishing move.

763
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,820
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

764
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,290
♫When my star falls only for you♫

765
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,700
♫When the heavens fall♫

766
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,320
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

767
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,570
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

768
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,990
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

769
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,960
♫As you turn into a falling star♫

770
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,860
Then, you can survive a desperate situation

771
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,520
and turn defeat into victory.

772
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,610
But what if my opponent is Zhen Yu?

773
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,440
He is the same.

774
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,190
But this is just a move.

775
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,870
He has great demonic power.

776
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,850
Even if I find his opening,

777
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,610
I can't take his life.

778
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,810
But don't forget

779
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,040
you still have the power of the Contemplation Stone.

780
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,070
When you gather all your power

781
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,360
to this move,

782
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,850
not to mention Zhen Yu,

783
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,080
you'll

784
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,570
have a 70% chance

785
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,590
to behead even me.

786
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,110
Really?

787
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,820
It's not that easy

788
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,550
for a human to defeat a demon.

789
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,380
But remember your feelings and moves just now

790
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,920
and get the knack of it.

791
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,300
As long as you practice hard,

792
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,140
and with the power of the Contemplation Stone,

793
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,180
one day,

794
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,920
even if you are to fight against the Demon King,

795
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,780
you'll still have a chance to win.

796
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,860
You really believe I can do it?

797
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,780
♫We're destined to be together forever from the first sight♫

798
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,030
You've given me

799
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,290
so many surprises already.

800
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,650
♫Goodbye, loneliness♫

801
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,700

♫The one who was slightly late♫

803
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,250
not because of the Contemplation Stone

804
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,980
or the Outlander King's Sword.

805
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:58,260
♫You came towards me, closer and closer♫

806
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,970
It's because you're good enough to be trusted.

807
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,460
Fan Yue.

808

♫You enriched my life♫

822
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,050
What place do you take Cold Spring Palace as?

823
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,490
She failed the mission.

824
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,170
Of course, she'll be punished by Grand Master.

825
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,390
Chong Zhao! Chong Zhao!

826
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,400
Chong Zhao!

827
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,170
Go and save Young Lord!

828
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,970
Fu Ling?

829
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,440
She was punished by the master.

830
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,010
She's suffering, locked in the secret room.

831
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,830
Ning'an City,

832
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,430
Outlanders' City,

833
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,380
Jingyou Mountain…

834
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,680
Young Lord has saved you and helped you

835
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,570
again and again.

836
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,640
The mission of the Fox Clan failed,

837
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,070
and she also took the blame for you.

838
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,110
She gave you her demonic flower armor,

839
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,180
but you didn't appreciate it at all

840
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,310
and took it off.

841
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,270
Without the demonic flower armor's protection,

842
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,570
the punishment is much more painful for her

843
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,660
than before.

844
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,870
But considering her character,

845
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,020
she won't beg for mercy

846
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,370
even if it hurts very much.

847
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,170
Chong Zhao,

848
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,130
are you really going to sit and watch her die?

849
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,860
She forced me to become a demon.

850
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,460
Now, I'll do

851
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,920
what she wishes.

852
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,810
You...

853
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,590
How do you think

854
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,040
you survived from the master?

855
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,030
That's because Young Lord promised the master that she could

856
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,450
drag you into becoming a demon within a month.

857
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,910
That's how you were saved.

858
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,300
She forced you to save you.

859
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,230
I didn't figure out

860
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,700
why Young Lord had to bear with the sufferings for you.

861
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,300
Now I understand.

862
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,670
It's not about how good you are,

863
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,730
but because she's lived such a hard life since she was little

864
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,690
that she'd take

865
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,900
the little warmth you brought to her

866
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,220
as a treasure.

867
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,880
She knew she would anger the master,

868
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,770
but she still repeatedly threw herself into danger like a moth to a flame.

869
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,600
Chong Zhao,

870
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,820
you are not worthy of Young Lord's love.

871
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,660
I hate you!

872
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,570
Congratulations, Master.

873
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,130
The evil insect has been made.

874
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,250
From now on,

875
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,530
the Eternal and demons

876
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,070
will fear the Cold Spring Palace

877
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,880
and turn pale at the mere mention of the evil insect.

878
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,080
You

879
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,490
sped up the process of making it.

880
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,630
Looks like everything

881
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,900
has been arranged.

882
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,240
Every move I make

883
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,750
can't escape your eyes.

884
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,630
I've been to Ning'an City

885
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,540
and also visited the Unbridled Pavilion.

886
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,740
Only by knowing yourself and your enemy well

887
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,800
can you kill your enemy with one blow.

888
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,820
Master,

889
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,700
I'm here to ask your permission

890
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,330
to send a big gift to Fan Yue

891
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,750
and bring back the Contemplation Stone.

892
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,770
Don't let me down

893
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,130
like Fu Ling did.

894
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,210
I will do my best

895
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,250
to complete the mission.

896
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,000
Tian Huo,

897
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,390
I need you to do something.

898
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,810
Master, please go ahead.

899
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,520
Do you know Bai Xi?

900
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,210
Are you referring to

901
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,960
the eldest daughter of Bai Xun?

902
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,520
Back then,

903
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,600
when you asked me to investigate the Bai family,

904
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,810
I heard something about Bai Xi.

905
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,510
It is said that she left home when she was young

906
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,710
and had no news since.

907
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,570
Master,

908
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,810
do you want to help Bai Shuo find Bai Xi?

909
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,500
Yes.

910
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,930
Why are you laughing?

911
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,220
You were good to Bai Shuo,

912
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,650
but you didn't know it,

913
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,920
or you hid it.

914
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,630
Congratulations, Master.

915
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,780
You finally understand your own feelings

916
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,450
and dare to express them, too.

917
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,730
However,

918
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,860
the Bai family has been looking for Bai Xi for ten years.

919
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,590
I guess Ning'an City and the surrounding cities

920
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,830
have all been searched.

921
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,240
If we want to find Bai Xi,

922
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,830
we should go further.

923
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,120
Maybe the Taoist who took her away

924
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,400
was also a clue.

925
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,410
I'll set off tonight to investigate it.

926
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,380
Tonight?

927
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,780
Why are you so hasty?

928
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,010
It's better to have something to do

929
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,910
than staying in the room alone.

930
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,100
If you have too much idle time,

931
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,750
you tend to think too much.

932
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,920
You'd always think of something

933
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,190
or some people...

934
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,380
Tian Huo.

935
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,890
Don't worry, Master Fan.

936
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,300
Time will cure a lot.

937
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,390
As long as you give me some time,

938
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,280
I will turn back into my old self.

939
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,120
You don't have to force yourself to return to your old self.

940
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,720
To me, you are the best

941
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,220
at any time.

942
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,110
Time can't cure everything.

943
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,390
The only thing that can cure everything

944
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,930
is yourself.

945
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,310
Go back and rest.

946
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,000
Let me do it.

947
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,530
The Demon King knows to care about people, now?

948
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,670
When have I ever not cared about you?

949
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,440
Master?

950
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,010
Why are you here?

951
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,300
If I don't come,

952
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,560
my dear disciple

953
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,990
will be abducted.

954
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,900
♫Writing wishes in the night sky♫

955
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,870
What?

956
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,650
You have a problem?

957
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,660
Don't scare my master.

958
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,490
♫The clouds seal their approval for me♫

959
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,980
Yes.

960
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,040
Not bad, my disciple.

961
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,760
♫You walk towards me slowly♫

962
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,590
The Demon King of the Polar Region,

00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,480
Master of Bright Moon,

964
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,670
is completely

965
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,630

What do you want?

970
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,060
What do I want?

971
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,660
Let me feel your pulse

972
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,410
♫Is willing to extinguish for you♫

973

00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,320
Not only have I recovered,

977
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,330
but I also have the spiritual power.

978
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,210
Spiritual power?

979

♫Lights up my long night♫

Am I now

982
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,980
pure in spiritual power

983
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,790

♫I'm afraid tomorrow is too far♫

Don't be happy too soon.

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,930
What do you mean?

990
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,930
Before, every time you were fatally hurt,

991
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,460
♫Don't miss me♫

992
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,440
the Contemplation Stone would automatically activate its divine power

♫I'll always be by your side♫

994

to protect your life

995
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,490
like a golden bell shield,

996
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,110
but it would also consume your health.

997

♫I'll fulfill this promise with my life♫

998

And now,

999
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,670
the Weak Water Stone is protecting you

1000
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,930
and also suppressing the Contemplation Stone.

1001

♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

1002

From now on, your protective shield

1003
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,060
will be gone.

1004
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,800
♫Every starlight♫

1005

Can I still

use the power of the Contemplation Stone?

1007

♫Is a kiss from me to you♫

1008
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,980
Yes,

1009
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,980
but it's just that it can't protect you.

1010
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,910
If you encounter another fatal danger,

1011
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,970
you have to solve it on your own.

1012
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,180
I thought it was something big.

1013
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,800
It's good enough to have the power of the Contemplation Stone.

1014
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,860
I never counted on it to be able to protect me forever.

1015
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,620
Don't worry.

1016
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,900
I won't let her get hurt.

1017
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,350
I'm relieved

1018
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,820

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,060
♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

1023
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,480
I've taken them all here for you.

1024
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,070
Remember,

1025
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,980
take some whenever you can.

1026
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,370
♫Every starlight♫

1027
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,900
Don't be too stingy.

1028
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,010
♫Is a kiss from me to you♫

1029
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,810
I'll save more for you in the future.

1030
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,930
Master.

1031
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,850
It's not easy for me

1032
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,940
to sneak out of Lanling.

1033
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,870
I have to go back.

1034
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,570
Remember,

1035
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,130
take good care of yourself.

1036
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,760
Take good care of her.

1037
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:06,960
Contemplation Stone…

1038
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,420
I know what you want to say.

1039
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,590
Don't worry.

1040
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,300
I didn't have the protection of the Contemplation Stone,

1041
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
but I grew up well until I was over 20.

1042
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,420
It will be the same in the future.

1043
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,570
I want to be with you

1044
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,830
forever

1045
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,840
and ever.
