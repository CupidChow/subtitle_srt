1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 25]

19
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,560
Qi Feng.

20
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,610
You don't really hate Fan Yue, do you?

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,780
Shut up.

22
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,380
But sometimes,

23
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,000
hatred is more powerful

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,170
than love to make a person go on living.

25
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,970
You've been suffering a lot these years.

26
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,250
If you hadn't had a way to vent your anger,

27
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,800
you may not have persisted.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,630
But the Bai Ze Clan doesn't exist anymore,

29
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,390
and the Tiger Clan has been eliminated. There's no one you can blame.

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,920
The only one you can hate now

31
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,840
is Fan Yue who is still alive.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,580
You hate him

33
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,750
because you care about him.

34
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,690
You can't forget him.

35
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,550
That's enough!

36
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,280
You think you're quite smart

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
and can read people's minds?

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,240
I did this to get back at him

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,340
and torture him.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,770
When he feels guilty enough

41
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,110
and suffers enough pain,

42
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,670
I'll surely kill him.

43
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,880
Qi Feng.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,640
Stop it.

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,090
He's been suffering a lot all these years, too.

46
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,690
He also wants to try his best to compensate you.

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,310
He wants to compensate me?

48
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,800
If he really wants to compensate me,

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,930
he should have killed Cang Shan for me!

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,280
But the truth is that

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,520
in his mind, I'm even less important than you

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,740
and Cang Shan!

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,840
He feels guilty?

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,350
He wants to compensate me?

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,050
It's all fake!

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,920
He's with Cang Shan now.

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,390
How could you miss

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,130
such a good show?

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,310
Master.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,660
What... What's wrong with you, Master?

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,570
Master.

62
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,810
I'm Cang Shan, Master.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,510
Master.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm Cang Shan.

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,950
I'm Cang Shan.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,630
Master.

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,180
Master.

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,050
Master!

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
Wake up!

70
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,659
Fan Yue!

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,530
Stop!

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,670
He's Cang Shan!

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,720
Master, wake up.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,100
He's indeed the Demon King of the Polar Region.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,080
Under the control of the parent insect,

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,740
he could even awaken a bit of his consciousness.

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,500
You brought me here forcibly

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,030
so that I could watch Fan Yue kill Cang Shan with my own eyes, huh?

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,550
Isn't it interesting?

80
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,500
Let go of her!

81
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,159
Since you can't bear to kill Cang Shan,

82
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,760
then just kill the person you love by yourself!

83
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,659
Fan Yue.

84
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,140
Cut her and take the Contemplation Stone out of her body for me!

85
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,930
Master, no!

86
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,630
Take the evil insect out and awaken Master Fan.

87
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,090
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

88
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,170
Just kill me.

89
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,930
If you kill me, upon my death,

90
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,330
the parent insect in his body will become wilder.

91
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,720
Then your Master Fan will never wake up.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,430
If you go save her,

93
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,960
all the members of the Stone Clan will die.

94
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,450
Fan Yue, wake up!

95
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,530
I'm Bai Shuo!

96
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,360
Qi Feng, I was the one who broke your legs.

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,390
They are innocent.

98
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,270
Spare them.

99
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,820
Cang Shan, if you want to save your clansmen,

100
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll give you a chance.

101
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,810
Kill Fan Yue.

102
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,000
Then I will spare the people of the Stone Clan.

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,460
Don't be controlled by the evil insect!

104
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,620
Wake up!

105
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
What?

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,159
You don't want to do that?

107
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,010
Then I'll let you see them die

108
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,909
one by one in front of you.

109
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,800
Qi Feng!

110
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,480
If you kill Fan Yue,

111
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,880
you can save everyone.

112
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,550
I'll compensate you with my life.

113
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,540
If I die,

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,880
I think your hatred will be over.

115
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,370
Please spare Master Fan and Bai Shuo.

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,730
Please spare the people of the Stone Clan!

117
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,960
Spare them?

118
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,750
If it was that easy to spare others,

119
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,900
why didn't anyone spare the Bai Ze Clan

120
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,120
and me back then?

121
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,610
Did we deserve to die?

122
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,910
Fan Yue.

123
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,500
Do it quickly.

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,830
Kill her

125
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,610
and take the Contemplation Stone out of her body!

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,270
Fan Yue.

127
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,170
Is it my ending that

128
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll be killed by you?

The parent insect entered Cang Shan's body.

135
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,300
Destroy all the evil insects!

136
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,120
Stop it!

You want to win?

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,790
It's not that easy.

141
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,130
Kill the three of them for me.

142
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,350
Regardless of the cost,

143
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,110
don't stop till they're dead!

144
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,030
We can't let the people of the Stone Clan enter the center of the formation.

145
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,120
Otherwise, with the harm of the evil insects

146
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,530
and the erosion of Bai Ze's resentment aura,

147
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,710
they will all die from self-explosions.

148
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,060
If they keep blocking it like this, they will eventually be exhausted.

Today in this place,

150
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,180
either the people of the Stone Clan will die

151
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,970
or you'll be killed by the people of the Stone Clan.

152
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,300
There isn't a third way.

153
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,250
There must be an ending

154
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
for all grudges.

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,240
No.

156
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,720
You are wrong.

157
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,330
Our Stone Clan

158
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,860
is best at cutting mountains to build roads.

159
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,520
I'll create

160
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,600
the third way.

161

Cang Shan!

162
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,220
Master.

163
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,550
Take care of my clansmen for me.

164
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,460
Cang Shan!

165
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,950
Don't do anything stupid!

166
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,710
Master!

167
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,390
This is the best result.

168
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,860
Only when I die with the parent insect

169
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,440
may all these grudges be over.

170
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,770
I've been away from home for a long time.

171
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,590
My parents and clansmen are all here.

172
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,330
Just let me stay here.

173
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a pity that

174
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm not able to see Tian Huo for the last time.

175
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,020
Master Fan can live long without worries.

176
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,740
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

177
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,630
At the Bright Moon Palace,

178
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,120
he's the best in the Demon Race.

179
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Cang Shan eats a lot every day.

180
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,960
Tian Huo lives with me happily.

181
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,050
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

182
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,520
Cang Shan.

183
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:58,920
♫To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart♫

184
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,670
Cang Shan.

185

♫I'm your wanderer♫

186
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,450
Cang Shan!

187
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

188
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,220
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

189
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,100
♫My love brought tears♫

190
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,220
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

191
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,470
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

192
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,100
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

193
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,840
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

194
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,550
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

195
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

196
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,920
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

197

198
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

199
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,220
Bai Ze's resentment aura.

200
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,360
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

201
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,420

202
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,350

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,230
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

204
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,750
Chong Zhao sent a message that

205
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,110
there is an ancient mirror hidden in Zhen Yu's room.

206
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,350
[There's an ancient bronze mirror with cracks in Zhen Yu's room.]

207
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,330
I've noticed that the pattern of the ancient mirror in the picture

208
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,900
looks like the Divine Pattern.

209
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,420
It's upside down.

210
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,470
In his letter, Chong Zhao also mentioned that

211
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,840
Zhen Yu has a kind of weird power

212
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,440
[Zhen Yu has a kind of power that is beyond demonic power and is not owned by Eternals, demons or humans.]

213
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,550
that is not owned by Eternals, demons

214
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,870
or humans.

215
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,570
Why have I never noticed it before?

216
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,170
It's not owned by Eternals, demons or humans?

217
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,000
It's also hard to notice this power?

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,420
Could it be...

219
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,600
the hidden power?

220
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,440
That's impossible.

221
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,060
The Hidden Race became extinct 60,000 years ago.

222
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,360
How could the hidden power still exist in the world?

223
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,270
But what if the hidden power still exists?

224
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,550
Could it be that

225
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,740
Zhen Yu is a member of the Hidden Race?

226
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,120
I once fought with Zhen Yu.

227
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,820
I'm sure he's a member of the Demon Race.

228
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,320
Then the reason must be that

229
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,530
he got the hidden power in a certain way,

230
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,860
and he has been plotting it secretly all these years.

231
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,380
What has he been plotting?

232
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,870
It's about the Divine Mirror

233
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,150
and the hidden power.

234
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,730
Can't you think of anything?

235
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,570
What is it?

236
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,830
Tell me!

237
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,230
The hidden power can be used to combine the power of Eternals and demons.

238
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,290
Then with the help of a divine object,

239
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,380
this person can gain the power that is as strong as a deity's.

240
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,530
Sect Leader, do you mean that

241
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,720
Zhen Yu

242
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,590
wants to become a deity?

243
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,690
I'm still not sure about it.

244
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,490
But we can't afford to take the risk.

245
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,120
Notify the 72 Sects

246
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,940
to come to Lanling for a meeting.

247
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,540
Senior,

248
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,230
have you forgotten this?

249
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,080
After the riot in Ning'an City last time,

250
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,750
all sects were worried that the war would be out of control.

251
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,720
To ensure the safety of the Human Race,

252
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,380
they don't want to start a war so easily.

253
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,340
No one will come.

254
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,910
This time, it's something related to the Divine Race.

255
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,450
How dare they not come?

256
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,810
If Zhen Yu really becomes a deity,

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,270
it will bring a disaster to the Eastern Continent.

258
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,740
All the sects will be eliminated!

259
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,480
Feng Yu.

260
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,140
Go send the message.

261
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,050
Yes.

262
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,119
Every time a Contemplation was absorbed,

263
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,560
the Contemplation Stone could always dissolve the contemplation power.

264
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,000
Why does Bai Ze's Hatred Contemplation

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,329
always exist this time?

266
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,700
She has been practicing Eternals' magic.

267
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,760
The power of eternals and demons cannot be compatible.

268
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,290
Shuo.

269
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,040
I'm here.

270
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,370
I'm always here.

271
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,260
Fan Yue.

272
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,070
She has suffered so much for you.

273
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,050
Not only can you not save her,

274
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,050
but you also can't share her pain.

275
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,100
What's the use of your demonic power?

276
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,640
Shuo.

277
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,550
I'll find a way to save you.

278
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,670
I certainly will.

279
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Aren't I in the Stone Clan?

280
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,570
Where am I now?

281
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,020
Fan Yue!

282
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,410
Fan Yue!

283
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,870
Fan Yue!

284
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,660
Fan Yue!

285
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,180
Fan Yue!

286
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,410
Fan Yue!

287
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,720
Bai Ze's resentment aura entered my body.

288
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,650
So this is my sea of consciousness?

289
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,680
Wood Fortress?

290
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,010
Is this...

291
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
Sir.

292
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,120
Is this...

293
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,650
An outsider broke into our fortress!

294
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,440
Someone broke into our fortress! Someone broke into our fortress!

295
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,830
-Who is it?
-Who?

296
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,690
Someone broke into our fortress!

297
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,610
I'm not a bad person.

298
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,900
Guys, don't be afraid.

299
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,180
Who are you?

300
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,160
How did you get in?

301
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,900
Could it be that

302
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,230
you're up to something?

303
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,490
-I…
-She is my guest.

304
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,190
-Hello, Chief.
-Chief.

305
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,840
Kid,

306
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,410
you're finally here.

307
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,250
I've been waiting for you for so long.

308
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,060
Greetings, Lady Tian Huo.

309
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,110
Has Master Fan come back from the Stone Clan?

310
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,510
He's in Ms. Bai's room.

311
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,750
Who is this?

312
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,920
Take her away first.

313
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,130
Take good care of her.

314
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,180
Don't be afraid.

315
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,310
It's very safe here.

316
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,710
They will protect you.

317
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,980
By the way,

318
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,870
why didn't I see Cang Shan

319
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,740
on my way into the palace?

320
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,280
Where is he?

321
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,070
I'll kill you!

322
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,860
Tian Huo.

323
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,100
Calm down.

324
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,920
Cang Shan died because of him.

325
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,120
Why are you still protecting him?

326
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,260
He is your buddy.

327
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,750
Isn't Cang Shan your buddy?

328
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,370
He put evil insects into the bodies of Stone Clan's people.

329
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,310
Although the parent insect died with Cang Shan,

330
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,280
the sub insects are still inside the bodies of Stone Clan's people.

331
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,960
They are still unconscious now.

332
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,060
Only he can force the evil insects out.

333
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,500
He can't die yet.

334
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,030
Take out the evil insects.

335
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,500
Otherwise, I'll kill you now!

336
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,680
I'll die sooner

337
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,250

No matter what you do, you can't change it.

503
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,050
Maybe

504
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,840
he is a calamity in your fate.

505
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,080
Whether to be trapped or let go of it,

506
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,870
you can only rely on yourself to solve this issue.

507
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,630
When I went out this time,

508
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,600
I found out about two things.

509
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,880
The first thing is that

510
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,850
the Taoist who took Bai Xi away back then

511
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,950
came from the Cold Spring Palace.

512
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,060
The second thing is that

513
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,490
there was another survivor of the Tiger Clan back then.

514
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,760
I got some information from her.

515
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,240
I think

516
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,270
you should also hear it.

517
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,800
Master.

518
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,700
What?

519
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,530
You still won't give up?

520
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,910
You still want to

521
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,400
probe into my secret?

522
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,000
You've misunderstood it, Master.

523
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,450
I have no intention of that.

524
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,450
I wonder why you've

525
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,880
summoned me here.

526
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,410
Chong Zhao.

527
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,770
You've been in my Cold Spring Palace

528
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,190
for a period of time.

529
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,860
Does Lanling

530
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,960
really not care about

531
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,620
whether you're dead or alive?

532
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,210
I've joined Cold Spring.

533
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,020
I have nothing to do with Lanling anymore.

534
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,570
Are you really that resolute

535
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,800
or are you pretending to be resolute

536
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,100
in front of me?

537
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,510
I was forced to kill Eternals by Fu Ling.

538
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,110
I've long violated the Eternals' rules

539
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,030
and been despised by the Eternals.

540
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,430
I have nowhere to go.

541
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,710
Since the Cold Spring Palace has taken me in,

542
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,510
I will only serve Cold Spring

543
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,660
and work for you.

544
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,240
Chong Zhao.

545
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,900
You should know that

546
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,860
I could have

547
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,160
killed you

548
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,500
several times.

549
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,310
You can live till now

550
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,170
not because of your own power,

551
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,640
but because of

552
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,240
my mercy to you.

553
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,260
Lanling has claimed to be kind and righteous.

554
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,290
But they don't care about

555
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,360
your safety at all.

556
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,650
They always talk about

557
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,260
protecting the people of the world.

558
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,910
But in my opinion,

559
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,650
they are all hypocrites.

560
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,430
In the future, you'll know

561
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,340
who

562
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,330
really cares about you.

563
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,440
It's my luck that

564
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,050
you trust me.

565
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,550
I'll definitely...

566
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,580
Since you want to be

567
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,860
a strong man by my side,

568
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,040
firstly,

569
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,460
I want you to

570
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,140
cut your ties with the Eternal Race completely.

571
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,730
As long as you have demonic power in your body,

572
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,330
you will never be able to

573
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,400
be a real Eternal again.

574
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,080
Secondly,

575
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,790
I want you to practice

576
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,740
the magic of combining the power of Eternals and demons.

577
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,930
How can the power of

578
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,180
Eternals and demons be combined?

579
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,480
No hurry.

580
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,190
You will know it soon.

581
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,380
Chong Zhao!

582
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,080
Did Grand Master punish you?

583
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,100
Is there any way

584
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
to suck out the demonic power in my body?

585
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,980
Demonic power?

586
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,150
Zhen Yu infused demonic power into my body.

587
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,740
He wants me to completely degenerate into a demon!

588
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,610
The magics of Eternals and demons are incompatible.

589
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,330
Doing this

590
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,510
will only damage your foundation

591
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,350
and make you die.

592
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,050
What exactly does Grand Master want to do?

593
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,850
I need to force the demonic power out.

594
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm a member of the Eternal Race.

595
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,310
I can't become a demon.

596
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,170
I still have to go back to Lanling.

597
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,200
Hurry up.

598
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,170
Help me!

599
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,120
It's useless.

600
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,360
It looks like forcing it out

601
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,800
will only accelerate the damage of the foundation.

602
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,429
At this point,

603
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,650
you can't restore it.

604
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,500
Chong Zhao.

605
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,230
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

♫I remember that word of concern♫

612

I haven't figured out Zhen Yu's secret completely.

613
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,330

♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

615
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,290
You're neither an Eternal nor a demon.

616
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,850
Grand Master clearly knew that you came to the Cold Spring Palace

617

♫I remember that drop of tear♫

to gather information.

619
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,800
If he didn't kill you,

620
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,429
he must have a reason to torture you.

621

♫It dried in the wind♫

622

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,780

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,130
eliminated by a demon lord sitting in a wheelchair.

672
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,720
That's absurd!

673
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,560
Although the Tiger Clan wasn't the head of the Demon Race,

674
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,530
few demons could kill the Tiger King.

675
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,800
Since that demon lord was sitting in a wheelchair,

676
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,100
how could he eliminate the whole Tiger Clan?

677
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,760
My memory of it can't be wrong.

678
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,380
Father.

679
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,820
Father.

680
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,460
Father, what happened?

681
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,410
They came quite suddenly.

682
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,080
The entire Tiger Clan was defenseless.

683
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,910
My father hid me in a secret chamber behind the throne.

684
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,630
That was why I wasn't killed.

685
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,320
I escaped death that night.

686
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,260
Since then, I've been hiding my identity and living in the Human Race.

687
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,810
And I didn't dare to step into the Demon Race again.

688
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,710
Until...

689
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,720
Until Lady Tian Huo found me.

690
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,970
Do you still remember the face

691
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,430
of that demon lord?

692
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,840
What?

693
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,220
Are you here to kill me?

694
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,580
It was you

695
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,880
who killed my father

696
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,300
and all the people of the Tiger Clan!

697
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,960
I can't believe that there's still a survivor from the Tiger Clan.

698
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,180
The murderer who eliminated the Bai Ze Clan is right in front of us.

699
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,580
How dare you protect her?

700
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,250
She was still young back then.

701
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,400
She's not the murderer.

702
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Fan Yue.

703
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,140
You are so kind-hearted.

704
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,330
Have you forgotten

705
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,030
how the old people, weak people, women and children

706
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,210
of the Bai Ze Clan were killed tragically by the Tiger Clan?

707
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,410
I was the one who eliminated the Tiger Clan.

708
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,960
I took revenge for the Bai Ze Clan.

709
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,170
What did you do?

710
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,300
Now you're still pretending to be righteous here.

711
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,080
Enough!

712
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,590
Haven't you killed enough people?

713
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,950
Tell me.

714
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,770
Why did the Tiger Clan search for the boy with purple eyes?

715
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,260
I don't know anything about the boy with purple eyes.

716
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,400
I only know that

717
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,040
there was a mysterious person who occasionally met my father.

718
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,500
Every time after they met,

719
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,240
the Tiger Clan would take action accordingly.

720
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,930
Who is this mysterious person?

721
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,390
I've never seen his face.

722
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,800
Nor do I know who he is.

723
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,000
But at one time, while this mysterious person

724
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,170
was discussing something with my father in a room,

725
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,590
I accidentally intruded into the room.

726
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,470
Father!

727
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,280
My Lord.

728
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,240
This is my daughter.

729
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,020
She is ignorant as a kid.

730
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,630
Please spare her life, My Lord.

731
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,850
Although I didn't see the face of that mysterious person,

732
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,110
I saw a black

733
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,000
snake mark on his arm.

734
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,810
A black snake mark?

735
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,760
Are you unwilling to accept the result?

736
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,250
I can help you.

737
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,170
I'll go investigate it now.

738
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,140
I once saw you in Qi Feng's memory.

739
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,180
You're the Chief of the Bai Ze Clan.

740
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,840
You know me?

741
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,160
Bai Ze's resentment aura

742
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,700
was suppressed under the Stone Formation by the Stone Clan.

743
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,220
We couldn't communicate with others.

744
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,100
Fortunately, with the help of the Contemplation Stone,

745
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
we're able to talk to you now.

746
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,450
I know

747
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,840
you're Bai Shuo.

748
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,030
I also know your relationship with Yue.

749
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,340
Logically speaking,

750
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,870
you should

751
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,860
call me Grandfather.

752
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,450
Greetings, Grandfather.

753
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,480
With you staying by Yue's side,

754
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,410
I feel relieved.

755
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,580
Fan Yue has always missed you guys.

756
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,380
There is a secret chamber in the Bright Moon Palace,

757
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,950
and the nameplates of the entire Bai Ze Clan are hung there.

758
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,830
He has never forgotten you guys.

759
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,060
Even when he lost his memory in Outlanders' City,

760
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,990
you guys were always in his dreams.

761
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,390
If he can't forget us,

762
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,400
it's not necessarily a good thing.

763
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,700
The more he can't let go of it,

764
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,880
the more suffering and pain

765
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,550
he'll experience.

766
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,230
That's the case for Yue.

767
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,090
And it's the same for Qi Feng, too.

768
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,340
Cang Shan

769
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,480
sacrificed his own life

770
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,160
to dissolve Bai Ze's resentment aura.

771
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,220
That was not what I wanted.

772
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,970
However,

773
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,810
I couldn't stop it.

774
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,690
My clansmen and I

775
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,630
will soon

776
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,570
disappear from the world.

777
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,660
There are some things

778
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,270
I have to let you guys know.

779
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,730
So,

780
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,200
with the opportunity of the Contemplation Stone absorbing a Contemplation,

781
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,220
I brought all the souls of our clansmen

782
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,970
into your sea of consciousness.

783
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,450
What do you want to tell me, Grandfather?

784
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,970
A truth.

785
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's the truth that you guys have been wanting to know,

786
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,180
which is about the boy with purple eyes.
