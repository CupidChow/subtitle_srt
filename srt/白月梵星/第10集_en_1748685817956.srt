1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
I think I get the answer!

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,180
Hm..

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,180
Wait, you can hardly open the door!

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,840
...

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,520
Vaccination

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
Episode 24

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,180
Hope like stars. The military is like the moon.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
Time is here.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,180
We are here.

10
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,180
I only want to see every star in the sky with my beloved one.

11
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
I want to be with you forever.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,180
You and him are not the same person.

13
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,180
Have you ever been sincere to me?

14
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,180
I want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Life is a life.

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
Life is a life.

17
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
We are together.

18
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
We are together.

19
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
We are together.

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,180
We are together.

21
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,180
We are together.

22
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,180
We are together.

23
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,180
We are together.

24
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
We are together.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,180
We are together.

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,180
We are together.

27
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
We are together.

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
We are together.

29
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,180
We are together.

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,180
We are together.

31
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,180
We are together.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,180
We are together.

33
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
We are together.

34
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,180
Tell me what happened a thousand years ago.

35
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,180
It was so miserable a thousand years ago.

36
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,180
It's true.

37
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,180
Back then, the Saintess of the Fox Clan, Linglong, entered Kunlun.

38
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,180
She and the Saintess of the Dragon Immortal,

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
but their love for each other was not easy.

40
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Later, they both refused to ask the truth.

41
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,180
But then, one day, Linglong suddenly hit Kunlun.

42
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
He knocked Kunlun out.

43
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,180
The Saintess of the Dragon Immortal, Lingxun,

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,180
killed Linglong,

45
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,180
and now, he is in the mountains to kill her.

46
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,180
He is avenging for Kunlun.

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,180
But I think Linglong is not someone who is so cruel.

48
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,180
Why did he kill Kunlun?

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,180
I don't know.

50
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,180
But I heard that

51
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,180
when Linglong entered Kunlun, he brought three people.

52
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,180
One is his sister and two are the same.

53
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
It's just a dirty thing.

54
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,180
Don't say that.

55
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,180
Since this is the Garden of the Dragon Immortal,

56
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,180
will the Garden of the Dragon Immortal who killed the Ghost City break the spell?

57
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,180
No.

58
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,180
Kunlun is connected to the Saintess of the Dragon Immortal.

59
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
You killed her, but you killed her in the Ghost City.

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,180
The Ghost City is not broken.

61
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,180
We will be trapped here forever.

62
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,180
Maybe there is a way to get out.

63
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,180
If the illusion is the Garden of the Dragon Immortal,

64
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,180
if we can stop Linglong from going to Kunlun,

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,180
maybe we can eliminate his illusion and break the illusion.

66
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,180
That makes sense.

67
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
What should we do?

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,180
Then we just need to do one thing.

69
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Stop Linglong and the Fairy of the Dragon Immortal.

70
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Awu.

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Why are you two so weird today?

72
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Aren't you usually like this?

73
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
What? You suddenly got far away?

74
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
How is that possible?

75
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
They are good friends, right?

76
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
Yes.

77
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
You three must protect each other.

78
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,180
You are in great danger.

79
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,180
Now Rongxian wants to see us.

80
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,180
Remember, she is the guardian of the Snow Lotus.

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,180
We must plan and trust her.

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
What is the name of the lake tribe?

83
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
The Beauty.

84
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,180
Who is the Beauty?

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Is it you?

86
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,180
Me?

87
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Young lady, please.

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Please.

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Please.

90
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Please.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,180
This girl is quite ordinary.

92
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Let the Saint see the smile.

93
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
This is my sister Awu.

94
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
We are too kind to her.

95
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
She is not polite.

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
I will give her a toast.

97
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
The Saintess is very generous.

98
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,180
She is a different woman from the lake tribe I imagined.

99
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
What's the difference?

100
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Everyone thinks that the lake tribe is a little bit of a joke.

101
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,180
But today, I think that the people of the lake tribe are wrong.

102
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
You two,

103
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180
it's a big deal.

104
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
The Saintess is a good friend of the Snow Lotus.

105
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
She is a good friend of the Snow Lotus.

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
The Saintess is very bright and bright.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,180
She is a good friend of the Snow Lotus.

108
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
I will give her a toast.

109
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
I trust her.

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Oh, no.

111
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
You drink it and I drink it.

112
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
It feels like two people are together.

113
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
The Saintess.

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
The Saintess.

115
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Awu just made the Saintess smile.

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Awu likes to make up for her.

117
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,180
Why don't you make up for the Saintess today?

118
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Let's be friends.

119
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Great.

120
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Then I will thank you.

121
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,180
My magic spell is pitiful.

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,180
It's called the magic spell.

123
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,180
If you have any questions, just ask me.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,180
I will definitely answer them.

125
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
Really?

126
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Of course.

127
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,180
Since you want to ask Awu to help me,

128
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,180
I have a favor to ask you.

129
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
What?

130
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,180
We are in the Soul-Bringing Soul-Bringing.

131
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Be quiet.

132
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,180
I didn't expect you to be absorbed into the circle.

133
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
You are a young master of the Soul-Bringing.

134
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
Why are you so sneaky?

135
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Who is sneaky?

136
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,180
I didn't ask my aunt to come to the city.

137
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,180
I am so stupid.

138
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Now you are in the Soul-Bringing.

139
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
You are a broken fairy.

140
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
What did you say?

141
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
I can make a sword-plate...

142
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
I will make a sword-plate.

143
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,180
I am not a broken fairy.

144
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Shut up.

145
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Didn't you say you are a young master of the Soul-Bringing?

146
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Why didn't you two come in?

147
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,180
I am just a disciple of the owner.

148
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
How can I be with the Saint?

149
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,180
I didn't expect you to be so good.

150
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,180
You can't even get on the table.

151
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
My aunt is the chief of the Mountain City.

152
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
She is the third prince.

153
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
Can you not hit me?

154
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,180
You think I will be afraid of her?

155
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,180
I am sorry.

156
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
You are the Saint Linglong.

157
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I am so lucky to have you here.

158
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,180
I am so lucky.

159
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,180
You are so funny.

160
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,180
The immortal of Kunlun is the Saint Linglong.

161
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

162
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
I am just a Saint Linglong.

163
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
Where is she?

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Why are you talking to the Saint Linglong?

165
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Pay attention to your attitude.

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Don't disturb them.

167
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
They are so angry.

168
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Rongxiang seems to be in love with Awu.

169
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
I will ask Awu to take Rongxi out tonight.

170
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
I will go to the Snow Lotus.

171
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,180
What are you doing?

172
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
From Awu's image,

173
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I am interested in each other.

174
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,180
This is the fate between me and the Saint Linglong.

175
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Awu, please help me.

176
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
I don't know if Awu agrees.

177
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,180
What else do you want to do?

178
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,180
I want to know the fate of a woman.

179
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Fate?

180
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Who?

181
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
It is...

182
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,180
It is someone I have known for a long time.

183
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
You have known each other for a long time?

184
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
It should be not Linglong.

185
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,180
Rongxiang is my fate.

186
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
She is the fate of other women.

187
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
She is still in love with Linglong.

188
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,180
Why does she seem like a romantic person?

189
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
But it is better that

190
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
she and Linglong are separated more easily.

191
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,180
It is better that they are separated more easily.

192
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Then Saint Linglong will tell me

193
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,180
what is the life of this woman.

194
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Her life?

195
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Awu!

196
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,180
How could you leave without knowing the rules?

197
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
I...

198
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,180
I have no manners to the person who comes first.

199
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
This is the rule of your Kunlun.

200
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,180
A'Qi, you have to be reasonable.

201
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Saint Linglong is not strange.

202
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Awu is a little bit stupid here.

203
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
He only knows the owner.

204
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,180
He has offended the Saint Linglong.

205
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
I will take him back and learn the rules.

206
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
No need to worry.

207
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Let's go.

208
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,180
It has been so many years.

209
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,180
It is still this kind of behavior.

210
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
The owner of the house is in danger

211
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
to save Miss Bai.

212
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Although Saint Linglong is a real gentleman,

213
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
if the girl of the Gu Nang is together,

214
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,180
she will be in danger to make Miss Bai

215
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
stand up for the owner.

216
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
With her temper,

217
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
I am afraid that she will make a mess.

218
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
Hey!

219
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
You know it clearly.

220
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
You are now a member of the Hu family.

221
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
You are now a member of the Hu family.

222
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Aren't you going to the foreign government

223
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
to stop the rebellion?

224
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
It is a mess.

225
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
A mess?

226
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
You are the one who is in a mess.

227
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
We will not enter the yard.

228
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
You are a useless disciple.

229
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
You are so mean.

230
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
You are a mess.

231
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
You are not even aware of the fault.

232
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Rong Xian used to be a mess.

233
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
I will avenge him.

234
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
What is the fault?

235
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
It is your Saintess who almost killed Kunlun.

236
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Don't touch her.

237
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
I will kill you.

238
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,180
The yard.

239
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
The yard.

240
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
What are you doing?

241
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Let me go.

242
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Let me go.

243
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
What do you mean?

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
Master Zhang wants to interrogate her.

245
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
He doesn't follow her.

246
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Interrogate her?

247
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
I have seen it.

248
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
You don't need to pretend.

249
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Did he see that we are fake?

250
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Qi.

251
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,180
You are good enough to hide it from A'wu.

252
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,180
Tell me.

253
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
When did you two

254
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
meet each other?

255
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
Qi.

256
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
We are not the way you think.

257
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
A'wu, don't explain.

258
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
I have lived for 100 years.

259
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
I can't see it.

260
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Rong Xian looked at you.

261
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,180
He didn't say anything.

262
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
He looked at you.

263
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
He cares about your feelings.

264
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
Even Kunlun dared to call you.

265
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
He is so stubborn.

266
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,180
I underestimated you.

267
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Young Master, it's not true.

268
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Don't be shy.

269
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
I like you.

270
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
You almost ruined our plan.

271
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,180
But he didn't act like a fool

272
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
to you.

273
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
What is this?

274
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
This is a lie.

275
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Only those who like you

276
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
can do this.

277
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Am I right?

278
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
No.

279
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
A'wu, you really misunderstood.

280
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,180
We are not the way you think.

281
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
You misunderstood?

282
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Let me ask you.

283
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Who do you want to protect

284
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,180
when you are in danger?

285
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,180
Who do you want to think about

286
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
when you are bored?

287
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
Who do you want to share

288
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
when you are happy?

289
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,180
Who do you want to talk to

290
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,180
when you are sad?

291
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
If you really like someone,

292
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,180
you will think about him.

293
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
Aren't you two?

294
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Of course.

295
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Sometimes, you are confused.

296
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
You don't realize

297
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
that others are really jealous.

298
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
A'jii,

299
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
although you are just a teacher,

300
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,180
I am always free

301
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,180
when I am in love.

302
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Since you two are in love,

303
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
I am willing to do it.

304
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Well,

305
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
I will do it myself.

306
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
You two go to the back mountain to practice.

307
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
He went there?

308
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
That's great.

309
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Wu Jian.

310
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,180
A'jii,

311
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I like Rongxian.

312
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
I will go.

313
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Enough.

314
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Stop talking about WeChat.

315
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
I can't sacrifice your happiness

316
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
to complete the task.

317
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
I will make you feel better.

318
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
That's the decision.

319
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
I will go to help Rongxian tonight.

320
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
You two go to the back mountain to practice.

321
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
If you can get the training,

322
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
you can do the work.

323
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
I will explain to the leader

324
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
when I return to Hu tribe.

325
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I will keep you in the wind.

326
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
You can be worthy of A'wu.

327
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Although Rongxian already has someone

328
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
she likes,

329
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
the beauty of Hu tribe is excellent.

330
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,180
How can Rongxian be so good?

331
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
So we have to hurry.

332
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,180
The faster we get to the snow lotus,

333
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
the faster we can take Linglong back to Hu tribe.

334
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
The shorter the time between Linglong and Rongxian,

335
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
the more likely we will be in love.

336
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I am still here.

337
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
You are so old-fashioned.

338
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Let me tell you.

339
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
We can't break our big sister

340
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
because of love.

341
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
A'jii and I are going to go back to the back mountain.

342
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
Bring back the snow lotus.

343
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,180
We have to keep going.

344
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Kunlun and Hu tribe are also fighting.

345
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
You guys are so naughty.

346
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Do you really think we can break the snow lotus?

347
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
Let's go.

348
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,180
What is the purpose of our Hu tribe?

349
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Leader...

350
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
We really come to the lotus.

351
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
Shut up.

352
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
You,

353
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
beat him up.

354
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Yes.

355
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
You...

356
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,180
You...

357
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
You are so naughty.

358
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
How dare you play tricks on our elders?

359
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
You...

360
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,180
Say it again.

361
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Let me tell you.

362
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
Don't be so cold.

363
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
We can't break the snow lotus.

364
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
We can't break anyone.

365
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Wait for me.

366
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
I am going out.

367
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Go out and talk.

368
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Once.

369
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
Don't talk so hard.

370
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,180
I can't take it anymore.

371
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Love you even more...

372
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,420
Until she says anything.

373
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Don't talk too much.

374
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
Let me tell you.

375
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Just hit on what you want.

376
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Each move is dependent on one person.

377
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
Once you pass those midev subtitle,

378
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
distinguished by three actions.

379
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Then you are back Azerbaijani Waste Team.

380
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Recently...

381
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
I was able to visit her.

382
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Then let you exchange.

383
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,780
Ask Lu say again.

384
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,620
You are...

385
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,180
If I'm not mistaken, this tea is the wine tea of the Hu tribe.

386
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,180
Shengzi knows the Hu tribe well.

387
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
It's good.

388
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
The wine tea is light and fragrant.

389
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,180
It's the best for the 1000-year-old double-winter water.

390
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,180
I brought it here to make it fair for Shengzi.

391
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,180
The 1000-year-old double-winter water is not that good.

392
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,180
The purest one is in the snow lotus.

393
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Shengni, do you want to go and have a look?

394
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,180
If Shengzi doesn't mention it, I still don't know about it.

395
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
The Hu tribe and Kunlun have always been together.

396
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Shengzi, don't worry.

397
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
It's the tea that I made.

398
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Shengni doesn't want to come to the river with a thousand miles away.

399
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,180
She wants to make the Hu tribe and Kunlun's 1000-year-old double-winter water be peaceful.

400
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,180
This is a great opportunity for us to have a good time together.

401
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
It's my pleasure.

402
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,180
It's normal for Shengni to ask this question.

403
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I also want to ask you,

404
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,180
if Shengni comes here before the purple rice,

405
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,180
is there really no other purpose?

406
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,180
For the sake of the 1000-year-old Hu tribe, I want to ask you for a favor.

407
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Isn't this purpose enough?

408
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,180
I heard that Linglong's Shengni has a good relationship with Feng Fan.

409
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,180
It seems that it's not necessary for today.

410
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,180
I also want to have a look at Kunlun.

411
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,180
What does the Kunlun Shengzi look like?

412
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
You've seen it now. How is it?

413
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,180
I can't bear to see Shengzi's glory.

414
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,180
By the way, I heard that the Hu tribe's Elder Elder is very ill.

415
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
Is he still feeling well?

416
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Elder Elder is fully recovered.

417
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
He's got a good soul.

418
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Plus, the Hu tribe's Sheng Yi has a good health.

419
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Thank you for your concern, Shengzi.

420
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
That's good.

421
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,180
This Kunlun is so suspicious.

422
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,180
The Hu tribe has entered the mountain, but Elder Elder is missing.

423
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
I wonder where Beichen and Mu Jue are going.

424
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,180
But there are a lot of dreams in the night.

425
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,180
We can only let them have a chance to meet each other at night.

426
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,180
After we reach the snowy forest, we will take Linglong away from Kunlun.

427
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Here, Xue Lian.

428
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
Wait.

429
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Is there a trap?

430
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Hurry up.

431
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
The Hu tribe is really in a hurry.

432
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
We need to get the He-Tan back.

433
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Fortunately, Elder Elder has a plan.

434
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
We will let you have a chance to meet each other today.

435
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Take them out.

436
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Yes.

437
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
No.

438
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
They are found.

439
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Elder Elder has arranged for us in the snowy forest.

440
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,180
You can't save them now.

441
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,180
You knew our plan long ago.

442
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
We are going to meet each other tonight.

443
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,180
To see my smile.

444
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Linglong, do you really not remember me?

445
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
I'm not sure.

446
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
I'm not sure.

447
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I'm not sure.

448
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
I'm not sure.

449
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I'm not sure.

450
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm not sure.

451
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
Linglong, do you really not remember me?

452
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,180
Hurry up.

453
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Hurry up.

454
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
Someone is coming. Come with me.

455
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
Elder Hu tribe is in a hurry.

456
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I know you are here for Xue Lian.

457
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Take them.

458
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Leave Kunlun.

459
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
No. Awu and the others are still inside.

460
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I can't leave.

461
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Awu and the others left me.

462
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
I can't send them back to Hu tribe.

463
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,180
But you knew I was lying to you.

464
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Why did you help me?

465
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Linglong, Kunlun is not the first time we met.

466
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,180
I've known you for a long time.

467
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Do you remember ten years ago?

468
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,180
You saved a great ancestor in Mount Qing Ling.

469
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Ten years ago?

470
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
It was you?

471
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,180
I was attacked by the demon tribe and got injured.

472
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
You can't recognize me.

473
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
It's normal.

474
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
If you had the three stars,

475
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
I would have died in the bottom of the cliff.

476
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
I didn't meet you today.

477
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
I didn't meet you.

478
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
It's not that I'm full of curiosity.

479
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
I just...

480
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,180
I just want to spend more time with you.

481
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Although Kunlun and the Hu tribe are against each other often,

482
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I always hope the two tribes can be united.

483
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
The two tribes are willing to break the gods.

484
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
Someone must take a step forward.

485
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,180
So, take the snow chain and save the ancestors.

486
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
But if you help me,

487
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,180
how will you deal with me if Kunlun finds out?

488
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Don't worry.

489
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
I'm finally the son of the emperor.

490
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
I'll be scolded by my master.

491
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
I won't die.

492
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Thank you for today.

493
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
I'll remember it.

494
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,180
I'll be sure to repay you.

495
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
What's going on?

496
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Why are we here all of a sudden?

497
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
They...

498
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
It's too late.

499
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
It's hard to tell the difference between the two.

500
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,180
Some love is a thousand years old.

501
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,180
And some love is only a thought.

502
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,180
I'm afraid that the two tribes will be separated.

503
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm afraid that the two tribes will be separated.

504
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm afraid that the two tribes will be separated.

505
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
And some love is only a thought.

506
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Why did it start again?

507
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
It's Rongxian's obsession to take us away.

508
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Everything in the world will change with her memories.

509
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Where are we going then?

510
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
I don't know.

511
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Qi.

512
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,180
What's wrong with you today?

513
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
I lost five rounds.

514
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,180
You...

515
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Don't get me wrong.

516
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
He was too tired last night.

517
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
He didn't rest well.

518
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
He ran away.

519
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
So...

520
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
It's not what you think.

521
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
It's like this.

522
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
He was too tired last night.

523
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
He's a little tired today.

524
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
I see.

525
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
He's young.

526
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
He's a little tired.

527
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
He's a little tired.

528
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
He's a little tired.

529
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
Come on.

530
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
You're back again?

531
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
What do you mean?

532
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
You haven't been back?

533
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
I haven't.

534
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
I'm not.

535
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,180
I'm not.

536
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
I'm a gentleman.

537
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Yes, you are a gentleman.

538
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Why don't you go cook?

539
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
I cook all the dishes at home.

540
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
You don't want to cook first?

541
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,180
You want to fight with me?

542
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,180
I washed the clothes.

543
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
I washed them.

544
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
You forgot to take them.

545
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
How can you say that?

546
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
What's wrong with you?

547
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
You're still so angry.

548
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
I can't find anything.

549
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm so tired.

550
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm so tired.

551
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
I can't stand it.

552
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I'm so confused.

553
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
When did I tell you to find them?

554
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I didn't find them.

555
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
You forgot our anniversary.

556
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Who bought them?

557
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
You bought them in a year.

558
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
You even took them to the private room.

559
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
I'm so sorry.

560
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
This is my last fight and dignity.

561
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
These are all trivial things.

562
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Shut up.

563
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
You don't love me.

564
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
You...

565
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
What I saw just now

566
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,180
were the Saintess of the Fox Clan and the Saintess of the Kunlun.

567
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
What you saw is a pair of ordinary couple.

568
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
They all say that they are as close as they are.

569
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
This is so unreasonable.

570
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,180
This should be the place

571
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
that I've mentioned before.

572
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
The place where Rong Xian and Ling Long were hiding.

573
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Wang Yougu.

574
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
They were all buried in this kind of place.

575
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,180
If you want to disband them, you shouldn't.

576
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
You...

577
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
You...

578
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
Sister.

579
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
I really don't value you.

580
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
You abandoned the Saintess

581
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
for her sake and were abandoned by others.

582
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
She's a good girl.

583
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
How long has it been?

584
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
You're so evil.

585
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
You have no patience.

586
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
What kind of Kunlun Saintess

587
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
is a good girl?

588
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
You're so evil.

589
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
I don't think a man has a good thing.

590
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,180
He's not that bad.

591
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
Awu, you're still young.

592
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
What you see now is just the moon.

593
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
But the two of us

594
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,180
have been together for a long time.

595
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
There's not only the wind and the snow.

596
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
We have to go back to our normal lives.

597
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Although he's not very good at cooking,

598
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
but he knows that I'm still sleeping.

599
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
He always gets up early

600
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
and comes back for breakfast.

601
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
He always likes to mess things up.

602
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,180
But every time I can't find the place to sleep,

603
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
he always comes back to me.

604
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Although he can't remember

605
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
every anniversary of us,

606
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
he always prepares a gift for me

607
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
and never repeats it.

608
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Even if he forgets,

609
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
he won't give it to me.

610
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Speaking of which,

611
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
this is not

612
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,180
the happiness of ordinary life.

613
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
That's what the blessing is.

614
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,180
And I've...

615
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
A'Qi,

616
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
do you see that?

617
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
The wife of a married man is very scary.

618
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
No one has ever had 100 birthdays in a year.

619
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
And any hundred arrows in the house

620
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
have to be used to put them back to the original place.

621
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
They have to be said from the inside.

622
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
They don't even let me break them in front of the private room.

623
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,180
Are you afraid? Are you afraid?

624
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
I'm really afraid.

625
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
So my suggestion is

626
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,180
you should go back to Kunlun and be the son.

627
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
How can that be?

628
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Linglong left the ancestral house

629
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
for me.

630
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Linglong left the ancestral house

631
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,180
for me.

632
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
She left the ancestral house for the Holy Lady.

633
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
And then came to the mountain to drink.

634
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
How can I give her up?

635
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Besides,

636
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
she broke down late.

637
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
She was afraid that I would be tired

638
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,180
and would break down after I had cooked.

639
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Remember that every anniversary between us

640
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
is a gift to me.

641
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm afraid that I would be

642
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
forced to go out and buy wine and drink

643
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
before I go to the private room.

644
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Kunlun and Hu Zu found out about it.

645
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
That's what I'm proud of.

646
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm proud of drinking wine.

647
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
No, I have to go back to the dream.

648
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I didn't persuade Linglong.

649
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
What about you?

650
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
No.

651
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Peichen said that

652
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Rongxian and Linglong were not together for a long time.

653
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
And then Kunlun and Hu Zu got into trouble.

654
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Fan Yue, we don't have much time left.

655
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
What do you think of Rongxian?

656
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
She's too drunk after marriage.

657
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
But she's kind and upright.

658
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
She has the style of a gentleman.

659
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
She's more like a lover to Linglong.

660
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
You saw that

661
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
Linglong gave up on Hu Zu's position

662
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
for Rongxian.

663
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,180
But why did she suddenly go to kill Kunlun?

664
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
What happened a thousand years ago?

665
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Let them go to the bottom of the pit.

666
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
You're right.

667
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
I was wrong.

668
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,180
You always do this.

669
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
You fight with me.

670
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
And I apologize.

671
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Yes, yes, yes. It's all my fault.

672
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,180
I have something to tell you.

673
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
What is it?

674
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
It's Kunlun's message.

675
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Open it.

676
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Actually, if Kunlun really has the heart to take us together,

677
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,180
these three years, he has already found us.

678
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
What happened?

679
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,180
The letter said that master is ill.

680
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
He is already lost.

681
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
I have to go back to Kunlun.

682
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Don't worry. I just went back to see master.

683
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,180
Kunlun has been looking for you for a long time. You should go back.

684
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Oh, right.

685
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
I have to go back to Kunlun.

686
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,180
Oh, right. You just told me that you have something to tell me.

687
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
I'll tell you when you come back.

688
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Don't worry. I'm at home.

689
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
Three years?

691
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,180
Why did you act like that?

692
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,180
You haven't given me that pen yet.

693
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,180
The change of time in the hospital is not reasonable at all.

694
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
I don't know where they are sent.

695
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,180
I don't know if I should stay in this bad environment for the rest of my life.

696
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,180
Why is he back?

697
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Master.

698
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,180
It's been three years since you left.

699
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
You are finally back.

700
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
I don't want to.

701
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
The three years have passed.

702
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
The two tribes of Xianyao are fighting for the future.

703
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,180
I, Kunlun, have been in the border of Xianyao for many generations.

704
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
I have a great responsibility.

705
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Rongxian, I have lost for ten days.

706
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,180
But no one can see me now.

707
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,180
You are my only disciple.

708
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
You are also Kunlun's son.

709
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,180
Only you can become the master of Kunlun Sect.

710
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Master, it's hard to say the words of the evil world.

711
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
The demons are not in the blood.

712
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Nonsense.

713
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,180
The demons are in the world.

714
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Xianyao has been fighting for thousands of years.

715
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
The injuries are not just the demons.

716
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
There are also the ancestors and Kunlun disciples.

717
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Why not fight to prevent the blood flow of the world?

718
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,180
I, Kunlun, will protect the gods and the demons for a few days.

719
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Rongxian, don't forget.

720
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
You are the son of Kunlun.

721
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
I have been away from Kunlun for a long time.

722
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
I don't want to be involved in the two tribes.

723
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I can only let you down.

724
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Rongxian.

725
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Yes.

726
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
You don't want to take the responsibility

727
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,180
because you can't let that scoundrel go, right?

728
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,180
I don't want to kill Lu Yanxu.

729
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I can't let Linglong go.

730
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,180
I and Linglong will fight each other for a lifetime.

731
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
I will not let him go.

732
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Since you can't let him go,

733
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,180
I will decide for you.

734
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Master, what are you doing?

735
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,180
The demons are not in the blood.

736
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
The demons are in the blood.

737
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
The demons are in the blood.

738
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
The demons are in the blood.

739
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
The demons are not in the blood.

740
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Rongxian, you are the hope of Kunlun.

741
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,180
I can't let you be the master of the demon clan

742
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
for the sake of a fox.

743
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,180
To keep the reputation and heritage of Kunlun,

744
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
I will pass all my spiritual power to you

745
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
to change all the memories of you and that demon.

746
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Rongxian, remember.

747
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Your father and mother are killed by the fox.

748
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
The three years ago, you were so stubborn.

749
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,180
You cheated Linglong and Yanjun.

750
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:16,180
The only thing you did was to kill the strongest Jincheng people in the world.

751
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,180
You never loved Linglong.

752
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,180
You only hated and killed her.

753
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,180
My parents were killed by the fox.

754
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
I never loved Linglong.

755
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,180
The demons should die.

756
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
The fox should die.

757
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
The demon should die.

758
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,180
Is this the truth of the fox clan?

759
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,180
I have to go back to the fox clan and tell them everything.

760
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Stop!

761
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Take them out of the room!

762
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
What are you doing?

763
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Let me go!

764
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Go!

765
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Open the door!

766
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Sister,

767
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
I didn't see Rongxian this afternoon.

768
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Where did she go?

769
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
She went back to Kunlun.

770
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Why did Rongxian go back to Kunlun?

771
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
Did you two quarrel?

772
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
She just went back to Kunlun?

773
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Of course not.

774
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
The Kunlun sect is seriously ill.

775
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
She is going back to the mountain.

776
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
What's wrong?

777
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Awu,

778
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,180
you have been with me for three years.

779
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I know you and Qi are in love.

780
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Why did you say that?

781
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
I just think

782
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,180
you are a good friend.

783
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
I am not.

784
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
I am just a good friend.

785
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
I am just a good friend.

786
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,180
I just think that you are kind and positive.

787
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
You choose her.

788
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Don't worry.

789
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
You are so kind.

790
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
You don't like to rest.

791
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Since you have left the fox clan,

792
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
you should go back.

793
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
You should stay here with me

794
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,180
and be a good husband to yourself.

795
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
Sister,

796
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
what's wrong with you?

797
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
I just think that

798
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
I am growing up.

799
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
I am just a good friend.

800
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Go and have a look.

801
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
What's wrong?

802
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Qi,

803
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
what's wrong?

804
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
What's wrong?

805
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Rongxian.

806
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
What's wrong?

807
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
You are not with the Saintess

808
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
and are hiding in Wang Yougu.

809
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Why did you suddenly enter the Fox Clan?

810
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Did something happen to the Saintess?

811
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Stop.

812
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
Saintess,

813
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,180
stop.

814
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Why?

815
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Why?

816
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Why?

817
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,180
Now you still don't understand?

818
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
She has been

819
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
trying to get you in the first place.

820
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,180
You are the strongest Saintess in the Fox Clan.

821
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,180
You should have been the leader

822
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
and the one who hit me.

823
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
You should have been the leader

824
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
and the one who hit me.

825
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
But she

826
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,180
lied to you and made you stay in the Fox Clan

827
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
while you were not in the Mount Sha

828
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,180
to kill the Fox Clan.

829
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
All of this

830
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,180
is a conspiracy of Kunlun.

831
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
It's not like that.

832
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
It's not like that, right?

833
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,180
The Saintess will be in the Three-year-old

834
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
and will go to the Sword-Sword-Sword-Sword

835
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
for the whole three years.

836
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
No one will do that

837
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
when they are together.

838
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
If I knew you were so stupid,

839
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
I wouldn't have to waste my time

840
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
to design the Three-year-old.

841
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Every one of these three years

842
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
is the moment when I fall in love with you.

843
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
I feel

844
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
I have to be honest.

845
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
I have to be honest.

846
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
But you are the one who did it.

847
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
If you didn't believe me,

848
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
how could I know

849
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,180
how to get into the Mount Sha

850
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
without anyone knowing it?

851
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Senior Ling Long.

852
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Saintess.

853
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Even if the Three-year-old is a lie,

854
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
even if you never loved me,

855
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
first of all,

856
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,180
they are still alive.

857
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
How could you do that?

858
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
But a group of evil demons

859
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
and you

860
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
are the same.

861
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
You

862
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
are the same.

863
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,180
You are the same.

864
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
I am the Saintess of the Immortals.

865
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
How could I fall in love with a group of evil demons?

866
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
It's ridiculous.

867
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
There must be a solution

868
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
between you and me.

869
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Senior Ling Long.

870
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Saintess.

871
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,180
Saintess.

872
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Senior Ling Long.

873
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Saintess.

874
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
I have been raising Saintess's name.

875
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
I wanted to visit Kunlun a long time ago.

876
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
What does it look like

877
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,180
to be the Saintess of Kunlun?

878
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
But you know I am lying to you.

879
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Why do you still help me?

880
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,180
I will remember the graces of today.

881
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
I will have a chance to help you in the future.

882
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
Then you still forget our anniversary.

883
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,180
You still want to think about the money?

884
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
I will tell you when you come back.

885
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
Don't worry.

886
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Leave me alone.

887
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Senior Ling Long.

888
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
You are the Saintess of the Immortals.

889
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
What are you doing?

890
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
What are you doing?

891
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Senior Ling Long.

892
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,180
Don't go.

893
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,180
I don't need you.

894
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
I am the Saintess of Kunlun.

895
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
I am the Saintess of Kunlun.

896
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
Luo Ru!

897
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Luo Ru!

898
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
Luo Ru!

899
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Luo Ru!

900
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,180
Ling Long, Ling Long.

901
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
Luo Ru!

902
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
Ling Long.

903
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Ling Long.

904
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,140
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,220
I didn't mean it.

906
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,580
My child.

907
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,540
My child.

908
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,460
My child.

909
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
My child.

910
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,180
My child.

911
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
My child.

912
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
What child?

913
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
What child?

914
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Can't you see that

915
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,180
she has broken your child?

916
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,180
The child that the fairy demon loves

917
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,180
is born to be miserable and hard to protect.

918
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,180
She has wasted her great spiritual power to raise her child.

919
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
Otherwise,

920
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,180
how could she die so easily in your world?

921
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,180
Rousin.

922
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
You did what you were told.

923
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,180
It's hard to tolerate.

924
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,180
Master.

925
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,180
It's me.

926
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
It's me who killed my child.

927
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
It's me who killed my son.

928
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
