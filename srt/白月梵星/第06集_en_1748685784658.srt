1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,100
Want more creative jobs?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I want to be with you forever.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to be with you forever.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The world is here.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We are here.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,960
Make life a equal place, and make life a reality.

16
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,480
Understood,

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,060
go where you always have to go.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:53,340
Finally we see WILL

19
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,660
That's right, happy new year.

20
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,540
Good.

21
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,820
Let's.

22
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,380
happen at the beginning.

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,540
Time to get together,

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,940
2000ros at White Moon Crime are

25
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:18,780
shop the Detective to poor 여� teamwork

26
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Without me,

27
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Wu Nian Shi is just a piece of waste to you.

28
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Since he is in my body,

29
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
then who is his belongs to?

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
I can decide.

31
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,780
You are quite good at acting.

32
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Uncle Bai,

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
in fact, you know very well that

34
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
I need you for a few years

35
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
to restart Wu Nian Shi.

36
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Not only will you not kill,

37
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,780
but also protect you.

38
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,780
They will only kill you

39
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
to get Wu Nian Shi out of the world

40
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,780
for the so-called great power.

41
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Or to kill you and Wu Nian Shi

42
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
to get you together.

43
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
So it seems that I will take you away

44
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,780
because you are willing to take me away.

45
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Am I right?

46
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Bai Xun was killed by the demon clan.

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,780
You want to become strong,

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
and to take revenge.

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
But you can only be the first demon.

50
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
You have seen the power of the Immortals

51
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
in your eyes.

52
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,780
You know very well that

53
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,780
only the Immortals

54
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,780
can really help you.

55
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
But you can't let me down.

56
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Now that I have caught you,

57
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,780
I can give you the excuse

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,780
to protect you.

59
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,780
No.

60
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Don't think too much.

61
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,780
I can kill Zhen Yu and Fulin

62
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
without the Immortals.

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Okay.

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
I like the way you act.

65
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,780
You want to take revenge on yourself, right?

66
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Come.

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
I will stand here.

68
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,780
I won't move.

69
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,780
But you can hurt me.

70
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
I will let you go.

71
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,780
I will never ask Wu Nian Shi again.

72
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
You said it.

73
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,780
You are right.

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
I will let you go.

75
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
You think the power of the Demon Clan

76
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
is the same as the power of the Immortals?

77
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
Zhen Yu is worse than me.

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,780
You can't even do anything

79
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,780
to kill him.

80
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
Maybe you can still act

81
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,780
in the human clan.

82
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
But in the absolute power of the Immortals,

83
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,780
you are nothing.

84
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,780
The current situation

85
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,780
is just a pre-existing training.

86
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,780
You have no choice.

87
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
I will kill you.

88
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,780
In the human clan,

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,780
you are smart.

90
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Although you can't get up in the power of the Immortals,

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,780
in fact, the power of the Immortals

92
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
is the beginning

93
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
of your revenge.

94
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,780
If I want to kill you,

95
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,780
as long as you can.

96
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
There is something to say.

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Why did you do that?

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
I just don't want him to run away

99
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
with Wu Nian Shi.

100
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,780
There are many ways to kill him.

101
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Why did you choose the most troublesome one?

102
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
What do you want to say?

103
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I just want to remind you

104
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
not to cause any trouble

105
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
because of the temporary shadow.

106
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
The Seven Stars will only have three stars.

107
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,780
If the stars are destroyed,

108
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
you don't have to kill them.

109
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
There is no more the Lord of the Hell.

110
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,780
I know what I am doing.

111
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
The human clan is in the battle of the Immortals.

112
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,780
It must be taken care of.

113
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Otherwise, why should I do this?

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
You...

115
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
You can't do this, Wu Nian Shi.

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
Chief.

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Please lead the army to the Jiyu to bring back the White Shoe.

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
We must take back the White Shoe.

119
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
It is just that

120
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
the Jiyu is a hundred thousand miles away.

121
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
There is no one here

122
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
except for Hao Yue Hall.

123
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,780
We can only send the disciples

124
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,780
to investigate the location of Hao Yue Hall.

125
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Once we find it,

126
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
we will bring the White Shoe back.

127
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Didn't you say that

128
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
you have talked to Fan Yue before?

129
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
When you came back,

130
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
you said that Fan Yue's attitude was good.

131
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
You should have asked the White Shoe to choose.

132
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
What about the result?

133
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Who is here to take care of me?

134
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
The evil clan is kind.

135
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
It's not reasonable.

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
It's not what you can expect.

137
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Chief. Where is Chong Zhao?

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Why didn't he see him after he came back?

139
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Chong Zhao has known that

140
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,780
he has been in the valley for 300 years.

141
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
300 years?

142
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
The valley is the most important place in Lanling.

143
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,780
It's a valley.

144
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
It looks like an external injury.

145
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
It's a very painful thing.

146
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Why did you still call him?

147
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Did you punish him so badly?

148
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
If I was punished wrongly,

149
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,780
I should punish him.

150
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
He can't escape from the chaos of Ling'an.

151
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
He has been in the valley for 300 years.

152
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
He still needs to go to the firewood.

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Although it's true,

154
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
but it's really a crime to be cold.

155
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,780
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,780
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
But the real crime is cold power.

161
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Cold power destroys the fairy demon's iron law.

162
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
It's a crime to break the human race.

163
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
It's a crime.

164
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Yan Huo.

165
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
You have 72 thousand followers.

166
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
You must send all the sects here

167
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
to help them escape from the cold power.

168
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Yes.

169
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
Go.

170
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Now, Wu Nian Shi is taken to the hauyue hall.

171
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
If you want to take it, you can.

172
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
But it's not easy to take it.

173
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Then let's see if my good disciple Fu Ling

174
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
can make Chong Zhao fall.

175
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
You want to use Chong Zhao

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
and that Bai Shuo's relationship?

177
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Before he died,

178
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
if he could really

179
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
take Bai Shuo and Wu Nian Shi out of me,

180
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
it would be his last glory.

181
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,780
I'll choose my own path.

182
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,780
No one is qualified to decide for me.

183
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Master.

184
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Master.

185
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,780
Do you want to see Bai Shuo?

186
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
He doesn't eat or drink these days.

187
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Maybe he'll die any time.

188
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
He knows what he wants.

189
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
He won't let himself die.

190
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Then what is he doing?

191
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
If you want to kill someone

192
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
who is a little bit low,

193
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
you must take some time.

194
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
This is the best medicine

195
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
for the hauyue hall.

196
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Whether it's alive or dead,

197
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
you choose.

198
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
The hauyue hall never raises the cost

199
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
of not living half dead.

200
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Choose to die.

201
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,780
I can help you.

202
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
I can only play the game of Wu Nian Shi.

203
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
You can kill me.

204
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
What?

205
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,780
You really plan to live a long life

206
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
with a piece of dead stuff?

207
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,780
I thought you were so bloody.

208
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
If I were you, I'd choose medicine.

209
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,780
After all, the hauyue hall is not worth it.

210
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
If you can really

211
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
kill me in front of the enemy,

212
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I might be able to see you.

213
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
I'll get it back.

214
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
I'll wait.

215
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Aren't you afraid of the real hauyue hall?

216
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
He's not as weak as you think.

217
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
He's a human.

218
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
But he's afraid of the hauyue hall.

219
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
He's stronger than most people in the world.

220
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
What you said seems to be

221
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,780
quite upsetting.

222
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
You seem to be quite fond of him.

223
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
If you want to detoxify,

224
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
and you don't want to report to the Blue Dragon,

225
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
why?

226
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Because you're afraid.

227
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,780
The people of the Wu Nian Shi are pregnant.

228
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
You should kill them.

229
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Even if you're not strong enough,

230
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
you're a self-proclaimed traitor.

231
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,780
Nuan Ling, I'm not qualified to blame you.

232
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
But Luan Qing,

233
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
I can't blame you.

234
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
I used to be a good person.

235
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
You are you.

236
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
I'm me.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
You're a fool.

238
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
The time of the hauyue hall is over.

239
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
The Immortal Army is dying.

240
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,780
It's you.

241
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
I killed you.

242
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
I saved you twice in Ning'an City.

243
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,780
You didn't thank me.

244
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Instead, you wanted to kill me.

245
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
I should have killed you in the hauyue hall.

246
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
So?

247
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Why did you save me that night?

248
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
You might not know.

249
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
I killed the doctor in the hauyue hall.

250
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
He was not allowed to see me.

251
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Who did he die for?

252
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
You.

253
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
You're a fool.

254
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Chong Zhao, what's the difference between you and Yao Yao?

255
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
The Immortal Army is so cruel.

256
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,780
But it's a small mistake.

257
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
So I killed you in the hauyue hall.

258
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
You're so mean.

259
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
You're not the Immortal Army anymore.

260
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
Chong Zhao, why don't you leave Lan Ling?

261
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
I'll be the one to take care of it.

262
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
You're so stubborn.

263
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
You're the Immortal Army.

264
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
You're the Immortal Army.

265
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
You're so stubborn.

266
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Who did you betray?

267
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
How did you know that?

268
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
I was right.

269
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I found a miracle.

270
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Ten years ago, the Immortal Army

271
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
killed the demon clan.

272
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
They killed the demon clan.

273
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
They killed the demon clan.

274
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
They killed the demon clan.

275
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Chong Zhao and his parents died.

276
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
They've been searching for years.

277
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
What do you want to say?

278
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
The Immortal Army knew that your parents

279
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
were killed by the demon clan ten years ago.

280
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
But do you know that two days before your parents were killed,

281
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Qian Yin and Qi Shi were dead?

282
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,780
You've been searching for years, but you didn't find anything.

283
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,780
Do you know why?

284
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Because

285
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
you've never been a demon clan.

286
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Chong Zhao, what you see now

287
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
may not be the truth.

288
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
But where you can't see it,

289
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
the truth may be there.

290
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
Tell me clearly!

291
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,780
I'm in Lengquan Palace.

292
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,780
I'll wait for you to come back.

293
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Master, my parents are the most powerful warriors in the Lanling.

294
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
They're so helpless.

295
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
How could they be killed by a demon?

296
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,780
That's impossible.

297
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,780
Child, didn't you see it yourself?

298
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Your parents' soul light is gone.

299
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
It's all my fault.

300
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
I've removed Qian Yin's medical power.

301
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780
I've sent your parents to arrest her.

302
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
But they've caused their injuries.

303
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
No!

304
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,780
My father said that even if it's dangerous,

305
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
they'll still have someone to come back alive.

306
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
They can't leave me. They've said it!

307
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
They've said it!

308
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Don't worry.

309
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I'll kill Qian Yin myself.

310
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
I'll avenge your parents.

311
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
You should practice your power and live well.

312
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,780
That's the best way to save your parents.

313
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,780
I've missed you.

314
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
I thought you were dead.

315
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I let you down.

316
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm disappointed if you're dead.

317
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,780
I won't let myself die no matter what.

318
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Then tell me what you want to do.

319
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
I want to learn magic.

320
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,780
You teach me or you find someone to teach me.

321
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Why should I promise you?

322
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm in the Wunian Stone now.

323
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,780
There may be a second encounter.

324
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,780
If you want to know where Xia Yi Nian is,

325
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
you must promise me.

326
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
It's dangerous, Wunian.

327
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
It's not dangerous.

328
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
It's a deal.

329
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
While Wunian Stone is still in the body,

330
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
you should learn magic to increase your power.

331
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
You can do whatever you want with your own hands.

332
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
You can do whatever you want with your own hands.

333
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
You can do whatever you want with your own hands.

334
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,780
The way of thinking is clear.

335
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
The strategy is also correct.

336
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,780
But why don't you take care of it

337
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,780
with the idea of ​​a deal?

338
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,780
The world's troubles should be reported personally.

339
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,780
My father suffered.

340
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
He was bleeding.

341
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
He lost his life.

342
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
One day, I will personally discuss it with them.

343
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,780
So, are you teaching me or not?

344
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
Most of these are the weapons

345
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
that were left by the demons that were killed.

346
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,780
So, each weapon has its own advantages.

347
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Which weapon is the strongest?

348
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
The Tantan Star is not good to you.

349
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Since you want to practice, I will practice the strongest.

350
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
This is the most powerful.

351
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
This is the fire-riding hand-pulled battle

352
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
that has been going on for tens of thousands of years.

353
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,780
The battle is not a fire-riding sword.

354
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
It is not a normal person who can take it.

355
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
It is even possible that the fire-riding sword

356
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
will be hurt by the demons in it.

357
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Are you sure you want to practice it?

358
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
I am sure.

359
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
I...

360
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
He really did give it to me.

361
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Could it be that it was my master?

362
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,780
I suggest you to let it go.

363
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I said that you should practice the strongest.

364
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
If you don't let it go,

365
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
your hand will be wasted.

366
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Tian Hu, take him back.

367
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
I haven't said that I can't.

368
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
I said that you should go back.

369
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
I didn't say that I can't.

370
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Are you touching yourself?

371
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
In my eyes, this is just stupid.

372
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,780
I just don't want to give up.

373
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,780
It's good to get hurt, but I can't stop training.

374
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
There is only one thing that is hard to do.

375
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,780
If you let it go,

376
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780
I won't teach you any more.

377
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,780
Tian Hu, take him back.

378
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,780
You are cold.

379
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,780
The hand-pulling technique is also normal.

380
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
Between us,

381
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
it seems that you can't talk about these things.

382
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,780
I can't.

383
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm not going to talk about it.

384
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
I'm reminding you one more time.

385
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
The number of the moon is hundreds of thousands of miles.

386
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
It's everywhere.

387
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Don't worry about it.

388
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,780
I don't care if you lose your life.

389
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,780
I don't need your reminder.

390
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
I still have to keep my life.

391
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,780
It's better to let the owner worry about you.

392
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Do you care about the moon?

393
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Everyone in the moon cares about the moon.

394
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,780
So you just stay here.

395
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
I will teach you when the owner wants to teach you.

396
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Don't think about what you shouldn't have.

397
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,780
What should I not have?

398
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Do I have to kill him?

399
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,780
Before you kill him,

400
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
I will kill you first.

401
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Even if it's a huge crime.

402
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I'm leaving.

403
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
See you later.

404
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
The first time I've ever seen a man like you.

405
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,780
It's really useless to shoot a gun.

406
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
I'm not going to give up.

407
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,780
You were the one who taught me.

408
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Now you're the one who's going to give up.

409
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
My daughter in white school is so useless.

410
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Can you learn it without giving up?

411
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
I'm not going to give up.

412
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,780
I'm not going to give up.

413
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
I'm not going to give up.

414
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
I'm not going to give up.

415
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Can you learn it without giving up?

416
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,780
Shu Er.

417
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,780
If you don't give up, you will not succeed.

418
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,780
But if you give up, you will fail.

419
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
I believe in you.

420
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,780
I chose to cooperate with the demon.

422
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm not sure where to go now.

423
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
But no matter what the road is,

424
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,780
I will step on it.

425
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Step by step.

426
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,780
I will repay the graces and the graces I should repay.

427
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Don't worry.

428
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,780
I will finally get out of my own way.

429
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I will not give up.

430
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,780
I will not give up.

431
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
I will not give up.

432
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Don't be so bold.

433
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Where's Fan Yue?

434
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Can you ask the owner if he's the one who's going to give up?

435
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,780
He said he wanted to teach me magic.

436
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
He can't see people for a few days.

437
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Did he regret it?

438
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
The owner said he would never give up.

439
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,780
But he said that if you lost your hand,

440
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
he wouldn't give up.

441
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
My hand is ready.

442
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,780
Then wait for him to teach you.

443
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
He will come back when he wants to.

444
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
It's obviously a deal.

445
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,780
It should be equal.

446
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Why are you talking about it?

447
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Who wants you to be in the good place now?

448
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
In the end, you decide the right to the owner of the shop.

449
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,780
This is a hundred-man business.

450
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
In our demon clan,

451
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,780
it's all a one-on-one fight.

452
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,780
Isn't it right to be a business man?

453
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
Our demon clan is this reason.

455
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
You're not satisfied.

456
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
You should be stronger.

457
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,780
You should go back to your human clan.

458
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
The owner is very thoughtful.

459
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Why did he give up so many days?

460
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
He's too eager to give up.

461
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,780
He will be disappointed no matter what he does.

462
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
So the owner did it for him?

463
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
For him?

464
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,780
I just don't want to be a useless useless man

465
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
who can't be bothered by the money.

466
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
The owner is useless.

467
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,780
But he still treats him as a useless man.

468
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,780
I'm not a good man.

469
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm a bad man.

470
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I don't want to be a good man.

471
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
If I continue to do this,

472
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,780
I'll become stronger every month.

473
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,780
No.

474
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,780
I can't continue to be this bad.

475
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
I'm going to find Fan Yue to ask him.

476
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,780
It's so late.

477
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,780
Where is he going alone?

478
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
What is this place?

479
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
It's so mysterious.

480
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,780
It's not a secret place to practice archery.

481
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
Or it's a treasure place.

482
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
What are these?

483
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Giant eagle,

484
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
oil man,

485
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
and a flag?

486
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
They all have names.

487
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Why are they hanging here?

488
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
It looks old.

489
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Is it the ancient treasure of Fan Yue?

490
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
I don't know.

491
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
I don't know.

492
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
I don't know.

493
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I don't know.

494
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
I don't know.

495
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
I don't know.

496
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
I don't know.

497
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
I don't know.

498
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
I don't know.

499
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
I don't know.

500
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,780
I don't know.

501
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,780
Fan Yue.

502
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Why is there his name?

503
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,780
Come out.

504
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
How did you come in?

505
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
How did I come in?

506
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
I followed you.

507
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
Get out.

508
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
Fan Yue.

509
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
You've been looking at me for so many days.

510
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
You should have enough.

511
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
You just wanted to fool me.

512
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
You said you were good.

513
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
You said you were good.

514
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
You said you were good.

515
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
You said you wanted to teach me.

516
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
But you didn't see me all day.

517
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
I didn't expect to see you here.

518
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
You were so upset.

519
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
What's the good thing about it?

520
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,780
I'll keep you in the Hall of Fame.

521
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
I'll let you leave freely.

522
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
It doesn't mean you can break my secret.

523
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
I'll break your secret.

524
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
I'll break your secret.

525
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
I'll kill Hua Du.

526
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
I'll kill him.

527
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
I'll kill him.

528
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
I'll kill him.

529
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Don't try to be my slave.

530
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
If you do it again,

531
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
even if you don't want to,

532
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
I'll take you back.

533
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
What you promised me,

534
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
you used your evil spirit to bully me and suppress me.

535
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
You're not a strong man.

536
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
What's wrong with me?

537
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,780
I know what you want to do.

538
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
I've been more powerful than you.

539
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
I've been crazy and I've been far from you.

540
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
You're a fool.

541
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Don't think you're so special.

542
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Just let me be strong and bear the power of being strong.

543
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
One step at a time,

544
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
one step at a time.

545
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
Go.

546
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
Go.

547
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
A-Yue, you're awake.

548
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
You're awake.

549
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
You're awake.

550
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
A-Yue.

551
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
Who are you?

552
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Yue, I'm the grandfather.

553
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Grandfather?

554
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Yue, why don't you even remember me?

555
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
What about me? Do you remember me?

556
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,780
You are...

557
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
I'm Qi Feng, your brother.

558
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,780
Did you fall from the mountain and get stupid?

559
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
Qi Feng, don't be afraid.

560
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
You can't remember it, even if you don't.

561
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
You are seriously injured.

562
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,780
You should take care of your wound first.

563
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,780
This is your home.

564
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,780
You can stay here.

565
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Then I...

566
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
I'm...

567
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Fan Yue, your name.

568
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Fan Yue.

569
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Have some of this.

570
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Here.

571
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Yue, here.

572
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
You said that we are 15 years old.

573
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,780
So we can drink holy water in the group.

574
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
We are good.

575
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Come, you try it too.

576
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Try it.

577
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,780
It's not strange to drink for the first time.

578
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Just for the first time.

579
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
Chief.

580
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Give my daughter a name card.

581
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
Congratulations.

582
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
You are so generous.

583
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Come, give us a beautiful white card.

584
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Give us a name card.

585
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Thank you, father.

586
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
No, thank you.

587
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,780
Yue, this is the tradition of the group.

588
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Every white card will be made.

589
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
There is a name card.

590
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
You have a name card too.

591
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,780
But when you fell down from the mountain,

592
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,780
the name card was broken by the stone.

593
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,780
I have made it for you.

594
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,780
In the future, we must be safe and sound.

595
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
No disease is here.

596
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
Yue, let's dance.

597
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Dance?

598
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
Let's dance together.

599
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,780
I will go too.

600
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Yue, let's dance.

601
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,780
Let's dance.

602
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
What's wrong with my small farm?

603
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
I know better than you

604
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
what you want to change.

605
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
I have told you

606
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
that I don't know you.

607
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Don't think you are so special.

608
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
You want to be stronger.

609
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
You want to endure the process of being stronger.

610
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
Get out.

611
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Is there any difficulty

612
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
in his past?

613
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
What are those names?

614
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,780
It seems that the moon is important to him.

615
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Is he thinking of something?

616
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
You are so busy.

617
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Are you afraid of me

618
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,780
because you want to get rid of me?

619
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
What do you want to say?

620
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
You want to get rid of me

621
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
and make me a doctor.

622
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
It's been half a month.

623
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
The task is not done yet.

624
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Everything is in my control.

625
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
You don't have to worry about it.

626
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
If you have time,

627
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,780
think about how to get out of the cold spring.

628
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I will do my best.

629
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,780
How to get out of the cold spring?

630
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
He wanted to kill me yesterday.

631
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,780
He came here to be soft today.

632
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
It seems too easy.

633
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,780
But he is suffering.

634
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,780
He is strong.

635
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,780
He has nothing to worry about.

636
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
I have something to do.

637
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Send the food.

638
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
What are you doing?

639
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,780
I followed you to the secret room on purpose yesterday.

640
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
I wanted to get your sick.

641
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,780
Or you taught me magic.

642
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,780
You suddenly talked about it?

643
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
I can't fool you.

644
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
I can't just say it.

645
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,780
I don't know what you mean.

646
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,780
But I did lose your privacy.

647
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,780
I apologize.

648
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,780
You are so strong.

649
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
So you want to teach me?

650
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
You go back first.

651
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,780
I will think about it.

652
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I hope you don't think too much.

653
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Don't pretend.

654
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
I don't eat this.

655
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Uncle.

656
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
What did you do?

657
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,780
What can I do?

658
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
What is this?

659
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
It is a mark of the reaction of the demon.

660
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,780
You are still not telling me what you did.

661
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
What can I do?

662
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,780
It's just...

663
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,780
You are so good at hunting the demon.

664
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
You are so good at it.

665
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,780
I am so anxious.

666
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,780
What is my situation?

667
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
You can't practice the demon.

668
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,780
Why?

669
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,780
Maybe it's because of the Five-Eye Stone.

670
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Isn't the Five-Eye Stone a god?

671
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,780
Will it make people stronger?

672
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Maybe it's because of the Five-Eye Stone.

673
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
What do you mean?

674
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
It's not a god.

675
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,780
It's a god.

676
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,780
What do you mean?

677
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,780
The demon is a god from ancient times.

678
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,780
The god is a god from ancient times.

679
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,780
The Five-Eye Stone is a god from the ancient times.

680
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
It's similar to the demon.

681
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
The more you practice the demon,

682
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
the more you will be affected.

683
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
I only heard that there are demons in the world.

684
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,780
The demon is a god from ancient times.

685
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
What is it?

686
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
60,000 years ago, there was a god from ancient times.

687
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,780
He was divided into three parts.

688
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
The demon was called the Night Lord Xing Yue.

689
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,780
He was called the Night Lord Xing Yue.

690
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,780
He was called the Night Lord Xing Yue.

691
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
But in this battle, the god is a god from ancient times.

692
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,780
The god is a god from ancient times.

693
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,780
There is no god in this world.

694
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
What you mean is that

695
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
if I want to be stronger,

696
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
I can only practice the Immortality.

697
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
Why do you think

698
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,780
I saw a betrayal in your eyes?

699
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
How can I?

700
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Even if I stole the Immortality,

701
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,780
the old man wouldn't help me.

702
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
He would control me.

703
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
You wouldn't let me go.

704
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
You can't get the Immortality.

705
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
You are right.

706
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Get up.

707
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
I'll take you to a place.

708
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Where are you going?

709
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
The Immortality.

710
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,780
What do you mean?

711
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue is a traitor?

712
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Didn't you say

713
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
you want me to teach you?

714
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Or I want to teach you?

715
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Who do you want to teach?

716
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

717
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

718
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

719
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

720
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

721
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

722
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

723
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

724
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

725
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

726
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

727
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

728
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

729
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

730
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

731
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

732
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
This is the Blue Forest.

733
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
How can you enter it?

734
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
I have my own way.

735
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
The master you are looking for

736
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
is the Immortality.

737
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,780
Why are you so familiar?

738
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
The rules are dead.

739
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
You are right.

740
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Why don't you go in?

741
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
I have already left.

742
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
Where are we going?

743
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,780
What?

744
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,780
I am going down.

745
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Stop talking.

746
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,780
You are talking about my old man.

747
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,780
This is the Immortality.

748
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

749
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

750
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

751
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

752
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

753
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,780
He can't even do the short part of his life.

754
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
My dragon.

755
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,780
I saved you in the Immortality.

756
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Now I am here to take the debt.

757
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Fan Yue.

758
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,780
You are not well.

759
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
Your Jiyu is the Immortality.

760
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Why are you here?

761
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Jiyu is the Night Lord.

762
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

763
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

764
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Zhenyu.

765
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,780
I think you are getting better.

766
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
The Night Lord Xing Yue

767
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,780
is chasing a turtle.

768
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
It has been a long time.

769
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I am back.

770
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
The one in the blue.

771
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
He knows me.

772
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
I can do whatever I want.

773
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,780
What?

774
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,780
You want to help the Immortality today?

775
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
How about it?

776
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
It has been many years since I came to Youshan.

777
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,780
The demons have been fighting with the three kings.

778
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,780
But I think it is the fight between you and me.

779
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
The one you want to kill is the one I save.

780
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,780
The one you want to do is the one I am against.

781
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,780
You are so angry.

782
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Okay.

783
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I will see if your new king

784
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,780
of the demons

785
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
is worthy of your pride.

786
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,780
Zhenyu.

787
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,780
You are old.

788
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I am a demon.

789
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
I don't need the three kings.

790
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
Fan Yue.

791
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Don't be too early.

792
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,780
One day, I will avenge

793
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
the death of the evil.

794
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,780
I will send you to the transmission town

795
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
to help you find me.

796
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,780
You have been looking for me for so many years.

797
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
But you stole my treasure.

798
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,780
You are so generous.

799
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,780
You are so generous.

800
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,780
I am sorry.

801
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,780
You are so generous.

802
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
I am sorry.

803
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,780
I am sorry.

804
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
I am sorry.

805
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
I am sorry.

806
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
I am sorry.

807
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
I am sorry.

808
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
I remember

809
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
you stole Wu Nian's stone.

810
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Don't be ridiculous.

811
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
You stole it yourself.

812
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
But I am curious

813
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,780
how I broke the old barrier.

814
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,780
It is like a forest.

815
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
What do you want?

816
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
Use your fairy-tale

817
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
to cure his rebellion.

818
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Rebellion?

819
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,780
The rebellion between Wu Nian and the demon.

820
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
You are the rebel of Wu Nian.

821
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
You are the one

822
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
who stole Wu Nian's stone.

823
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Do you know?

824
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Yes.

825
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
And

826
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,780
I will teach him a lesson.

827
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
You should tell Jin Yao

828
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
that I let you in.

829
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
You have the most treasure.

830
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
I am afraid that I can't catch the king.

831
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
I don't want to

832
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
have five old men at the same time.

833
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
You are the young master

834
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
who is born in the world.

835
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Are you afraid of Wu Shangxian?

836
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Wu Shangxian is not afraid.

837
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Wu Nian's stone is the most dangerous.

838
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
You are the king of Wu Nian's stone.

839
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
I can't catch the king

840
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
even if I take you.

841
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,780
Enough.

842
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
Teach him a lesson.

843
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Give your life to me.

844
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,780
Calm down.

845
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,780
I will teach him a lesson.

846
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
You are sure

847
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
that you want to let this

848
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
good Wu Di

849
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
be my master?

850
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
What do you think he can teach me?

851
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Take this.

852
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Your reflex will be gone soon.

853
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Is it that powerful?

854
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Of course.

855
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
If I am the second one in the world

856
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
no one will dare to call me the first.

857
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,780
You are so smart.

858
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
You sold me the ghost that I wanted

859
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
years ago.

860
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
You are comparing me to the ghosts.

861
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Do you want to return the medicine?

862
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I am just saying.

863
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,780
I have met too many cheats before.

864
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,780
I am confident in the people

865
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,780
that the master introduced.

866
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
How is it?

867
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,780
Do you want to return the medicine?

868
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
Look.

869
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,780
Look.

870
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
Old turtle, look.

871
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,780
I am back.

872
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
A girl's family is affected.

873
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,780
What is the effect?

874
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,780
Take it.

875
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,780
What is it?

876
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,780
You stay here and learn.

877
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Sometimes you use this to contact Hai Luo.

878
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,780
I stay here myself.

879
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,780
I am here to help you.

880
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,780
I stay here myself.

881
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,780
What if the ancestors find out?

882
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,780
That's why I am here.

883
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Don't lose your time.

884
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Otherwise, you will be lost.

885
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,780
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

886
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,780
You don't have to warn me.

887
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,780
I will take care of your people.

888
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Let's start.

889
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
Are you okay?

890
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
First, you should bow to the master.

891
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,780
I bow to the father and mother.

892
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,780
I have never bowed to anyone except the master.

893
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
If you want me to bow to the master,

894
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,780
you have to show me your true ability.

895
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,780
If you don't bow, I won't.

896
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,780
You don't know?

897
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,780
Master.

898
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Say it.

899
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,780
Little ancestors, I will not bow.

900
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,780
I will not bow.

901
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,780
You are good.

902
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,780
It's nothing.

903
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,780
I will not bow.

904
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,780
You are safe now.

905
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
You are safe now.

906
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
I will learn from the old master.

907
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
When I am done,

908
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,780
remember to take me back.

909
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
Okay.

910
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
I will bow.

911
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
I will not bow.

912
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
There must be many people who can see the world in a thousand years.

913
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
There must be many people who can see the world in a thousand years.

914
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,780
There must be many people who can see the world in a thousand years.

915
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,780
What should I learn first?

916
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Look carefully.

917
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,780
Have you learned?

918
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
What?

919
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,780
The pen.

920
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Are you sure it's the fairy?

921
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,780
What is the most important thing?

922
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,780
To defeat the enemy.

923
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
To defeat the enemy?

924
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,780
To defeat the enemy?

925
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,780
To defeat the enemy?

926
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,780
I taught you the proper secret technique.

927
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
The secret technique.

928
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
Of course, you can call it

929
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
the death weapon.

930
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
I will teach you something else.

931
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,780
I will teach you something else.

932
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,780
You are the light I want to forget.

933
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,780
It is the lonely journey.

934
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Let this moment be with you.

935
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,780
I want to have you.

936
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,780
Let the sea be with you.

937
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:19,780
I will learn from the old master.

938
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,780
You are the blue earth I want to live.

939
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,780
Let the rain and the fog

940
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,780
make tears fall.

941
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,780
Let the sound of the flute

942
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:44,780
make the wind blow.

943
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,780
Let the wind blow.
