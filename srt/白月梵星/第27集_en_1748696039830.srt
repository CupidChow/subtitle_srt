1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Right.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
Aren't we gonna survive now?

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,140
Master camping tonight!

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,540
Full ab footprints!

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,560
For decades!

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
The world is here.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
We are here.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I only want to watch every sunset with my beloved.

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
I want to be with you forever.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
The fairy demon is a disciple.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
You and her are not the same person.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,560
Perfect Love

14
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:52,760
A

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
The life is clear.

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
The life is true.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Let's live together.

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Let's die together.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Let's live together.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:32,760
The life is clear.

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Let's live together.

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's live together.

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
The life is true.

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's live together.

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
All the hardships in the world,

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
all your efforts.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I'm not Bai Xi, I'm not!

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Since you're in so much pain,

29
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
I can help you to resolve this.

30
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Anyway, I'm not the one

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
you really want to find.

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Please spare my life, Princess.

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
You're not surprised at all.

34
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Looks like you already know her.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Whether she's Fulin or Bai Xi,

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
she can't even kill the princess.

37
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
As long as the princess let her go,

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Cheng Zhao will definitely be a dead man.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,760
She's already so important to you.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
I can.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I can spare her a life.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
But from now on,

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
she's not allowed to go out of the door again.

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Otherwise...

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Cheng Zhao will surely get used to her.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
You can leave now.

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Fan Yue,

48
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,760
are you one of the three children?

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I'll know everything.

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
You're leaving?

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I'm not leaving.

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I want to see you.

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Do you want to see me or Bai Xi?

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,760
No matter if you're Fulin or Bai Xi,

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I want to see you.

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
No.

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't want to see you.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
I don't want to see you.

59
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
No.

60
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm not Bai Xi.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,760
It's all because of Zhan Yu.

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I'm Fulin.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm a drug.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm just a useless woman who abandoned me.

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm not Bai Xi.

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
What are you doing?

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I gave her all my strength.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
I don't want her to be mine.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
I'll return her back.

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
You don't owe her anything.

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
She owes you.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Fulin,

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,760
I've already sent the secret of the Cold Spring Palace to Lan Li.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll send it to you.

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll send it to you.

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
I'll send it to you.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll send it to you.

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,760
I've already sent the secret of the Cold Spring Palace to Lan Li.

79
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
The Immortal Sect will come back to the Cold Spring soon.

80
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I'll take you away from here.

81
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Leave?

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Where?

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Will you go back to Lan Ling?

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm a demoness who's been doing bad things.

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I'll go back to Xian Mei with you.

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
They'll kill me right away.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I won't let them kill you.

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
You've gone through this.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
You're also saying that Zhen Yu killed you.

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Don't worry.

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I'll make the name of Xian Mei.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Don't you understand?

93
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
I'm not Bai Xi.

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Bai Xi died ten years ago.

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm Fulin.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,760
And my life is none of your business.

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
You go.

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
I'm tired.

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I'll be there in a while.

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
I'll be there in a while.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm willing to give my life to you.

102
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll give you my life.

103
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I'll be there in a while.

104
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I'm Chen Xi.

105
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
You're Xin Yue.

106
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
You're the new minister.

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
You're the first one to be out.

108
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,760
My mom said that you should be like the new moon in the sky.

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
The moon is dark.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
The moon is shining.

111
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
As long as you're ready, you can go down.

112
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I'll always be by your side.

113
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm not Bai Xi.

114
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll protect you.

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm not Bai Xi.

116
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
I'll protect you.

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
My lord.

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Go out.

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
You mean the key to the Black Snake seal is Zhen Yu?

120
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Yes.

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
I asked A'Noa to draw the Black Snake seal.

122
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
I went out of the Hall of Fame to investigate all the secrets.

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I found out that Zhen Yu is not from the Heavenly Saint Clan.

124
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
But from the Snake-Demon-Sword.

125
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
The Black Snake seal is from Zhen Yu.

126
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Ten years ago, the whole Demon Clan

127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
could have the Tiger King's hand be in the hands of every few.

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Zhen Yu is one of them.

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
But why did he ask for Zitong?

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Qi Feng.

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Qi Feng.

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Qi Feng.

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Qi Feng is not Zhen Yu.

134
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
He's the revenge for the White Snake Clan.

135
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
He didn't kill A'Noa.

136
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
It's because he has the same idea.

137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
What's wrong?

138
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
What else did you find?

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I just got the news from the Cold Palace.

140
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
The Chenye's betrayal and the Zhen Yu's assassination.

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Today, the Zhen Yu will be executed by Chenye.

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Tian Huo.

143
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Take the White Snake.

144
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Don't let him get any trouble.

145
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
The Hall of Fame will be executed by the Cold Palace.

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I have to report it myself.

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
But Zhen Yu suddenly released this kind of news.

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm afraid he has found out the relationship between Chenye and the Hall of Fame.

149
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
He intentionally designed to lure you into the Bureau.

150
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Will the Hall of Fame be executed by the Zhen Yu?

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I didn't mean that.

152
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
But Zhen Yu is a dangerous person.

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
It's better for me to go with the Hall of Fame.

154
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
The key point of the White Snake is that it can't be disturbed by any trouble.

155
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Take the White Snake.

156
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
It's your most important task now.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
It's the Hall of Fame's mission to protect the Hall of Fame.

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
It's my mission.

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
If you still think I'm the Hall of Fame

160
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
and you still think I'm the Hall of Fame's guardian,

161
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
then follow my orders.

162
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm asking you.

163
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Chenye failed to get out of the Bureau.

164
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
What should I do?

165
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Kill!

166
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm asking you again.

167
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Chenye colluded with the enemy and tried to rebel.

168
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
What should I do?

169
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Kill!

170
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I'm asking you one last time.

171
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Chenye is not only against me,

172
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
but also against me.

173
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
What should I do?

174
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Kill!

175
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
My life is your destiny.

176
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Zhen Yu is not fit to fight for his life.

177
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,760
The world wants your life to be sealed and peaceful.

178
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Peaceful?

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Do you know what I'm going to do next?

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Once I succeed in my plan,

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
the world will be filled with power.

182
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Zhen Yu!

183
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm sorry for your loss.

184
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Today,

185
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I will teach you a lesson.

186
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
I will not let you go.

187
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Ji Feng, I'm here to see you.

188
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Go.

189
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm not afraid of Chenye.

190
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
You are right.

191
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
If I'm right,

192
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
you are also a member of the Bai Ze Clan.

193
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Back then,

194
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,760
the boy I wanted to find was actually you.

195
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Right?

196
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Chenye protected you.

197
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
If I were you,

198
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I would come to save him.

199
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Fan Yu, I don't need you to pity me.

200
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I don't need you to save me.

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Go!

202
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Chenye, you are so sincere to him.

203
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I can't let you teach him a lesson.

204
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I have a mysterious power of flying medicine.

205
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I can't deal with it.

206
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
I'll take you away.

207
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I can't do it anymore.

208
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I never thought that I would leave alive.

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I'll leave the Bai Ze Clan to you.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Go!

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Go!

212
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Don't leave!

213
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
These years,

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
I killed a demon everywhere.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Do you really think that I did it to repair the Jiao Wei?

216
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
That's just a blind eye.

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
I've given all the demons this border.

218
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
As long as I have enough demons,

219
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I can completely repair the border.

220
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
The people I want to win will return soon.

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Go!

222
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Fan Yue is in the Palace of the Dragon.

223
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Chen Yu is being dragged by Fan Yue.

224
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
It's the best chance for us to leave the Palace of the Dragon.

225
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I said I won't go anywhere.

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
You should go.

227
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I must take you away from this hell.

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
This is the ancient spirit mirror of 60,000 years ago.

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
It's not as powerful as the other.

230
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Fan Yue,

231
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,760
your demon power is much more useful than those ordinary demons.

232
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
The power of the spirit mirror is so powerful.

233
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
It's really a magical power.

234
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
I didn't make any mistakes.

235
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
You are the god of the 60,000 years ago.

236
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
That's why you can practice Jiao Wei.

237
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
You can cure Chen Ye's legs.

238
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
It's also because you have a secret power.

239
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
You guessed it right.

240
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Unfortunately, you have no chance to fight with me.

241
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Qi Feng!

242
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I've never been able to get out of the Dragon before.

243
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,760
I can't create a chance without you.

244
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Chen Yu,

245
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I won't let you do anything you want to do.

246
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Qi Feng.

247
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Qi Feng.

248
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Qi Feng.

249
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Qi Feng.

250
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Qi Feng.

251
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Qi Feng.

252
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Qi Feng.

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Qi Feng.

254
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Qi Feng.

255
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I forgive you this time.

256
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I'll do my best.

257
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I'll go to the room with you.

258
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll go to the room with you.

259
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I won't look back this time.

260
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Do you have the same moonlight on your way?

261
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Let's go to the endless city.

262
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,760
How can we reach the sea?

263
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,760
The wind blows through the mountains.

264
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,760
The dream is long.

265
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,760
I can't stop time.

266
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I'm afraid of the world.

267
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,760
I can't turn back.

268
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Let's go to the endless city.

269
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,760
How can we reach the sea?

270
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,760
The wind blows through the mountains.

271
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
The dream is long.

272
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I can't stop time.

273
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I'm afraid of the world.

274
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I can't stop time.

275
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Zun Shang.

276
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Zhen Yu.

277
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,760
You are not like me.

278
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Shuo.

279
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Shuo.

280
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
I told you I'll kill you.

281
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
I'll avenge my father.

282
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Shuo.

283
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
You are not like me.

284
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
You are just a dragon.

285
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I'm telling you, even if you are a dragon,

286
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I won't kill you.

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,760
You are not like me.

288
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm telling you, even if you are a dragon,

289
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I won't kill you.

290
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm telling you, even if you are a dragon,

291
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,760
I won't kill you.

292
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
If you can't fight with the gun,

293
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,760
use the fastest speed to attack the enemy.

294
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,760
If you can't catch the only one who can break it,

295
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
you can't win the battle.

296
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'll die.

297
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
What if my opponent is Zhen Yu?

298
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
He's the same.

299
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
But it's just a trick.

300
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
He's so strong.

301
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Even if I find his break,

302
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
I can't break his life.

303
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
But don't forget,

304
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
you still have the power of the Five-Times.

305
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
When you put all your power into this ritual,

306
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
even if it's me,

307
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
you have the power of seven-times.

308
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
You can fight.

309
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
If you want to use the human's power,

310
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
you can't.

311
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
But you have to remember the feeling and move

312
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
and the power of the spirit.

313
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
As long as you work hard,

314
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
you have the power of the Five-Times.

315
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
One day, even if you are the monster,

316
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
you can fight.

317
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
I'm not afraid of you.

318
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I'm afraid of myself.

319
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
I'm afraid of the past.

320
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm tired of living my life

321
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
and my life.

322
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm gonna die.

323
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,760
I'm gonna die.

324
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm gonna die.

325
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm gonna die.

326
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm gonna die.

327
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,160
I'll take you home.

328
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,680
Okay.

329
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,680
Uncle.

330
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,320
Uncle.

331
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,680
Uncle.

332
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Uncle.

333
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,120
Uncle.

334
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
Uncle.

335
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,080
Stop!

336
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Stop! Stop!

337
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Where am I?

338
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
I'm here to see you.

339
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Why are you so serious?

340
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Xi.

341
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Xi, why haven't you come home yet?

342
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I'll take you home.

343
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Otherwise, Uncle will be worried.

344
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Stop it.

345
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Your hands are red.

346
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Today is my mother's birthday.

347
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Father has been keeping me in his room.

348
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,080
I want to make some steamed buns for my father and Uncle.

349
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Let them be happy.

350
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Xi, what about you?

351
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,080
You must be very sad.

352
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I'll help you.

353
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Don't be sad in the future.

354
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Don't be sad.

355
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I believe Uncle Bai and Uncle A'chu

356
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
want to see you happy.

357
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Happy?

358
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Do I still have the right to have it?

359
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
You're awake.

360
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Drink it.

361
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Do you remember where it is?

362
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
I don't.

363
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Why did you take me away from the Cold Palace?

364
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
No one really wants to stay in the hell.

365
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
You didn't have a choice.

366
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Now, as long as you have the courage to believe in yourself and me,

367
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
you can actually have a choice.

368
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm sorry.

369
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,080
I said I wouldn't let you get hurt.

370
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,080
I didn't protect you.

371
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,080
You can do whatever you want when you have a choice.

372
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Come and tell me, okay?

373
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Master, I didn't say anything.

374
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm sorry.

375
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
You have to say it.

379
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
He's so quick to finish the practice of his thoughts and spiritual power.

380
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Tian Hu.

381
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Why are you here?

382
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Where's Fan Yue?

383
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
The Hall Master wants to handle something.

384
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
He asked me to do it for you.

385
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
He won't leave me alone.

386
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Is there anything wrong?

387
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Only Chen Ye can make Fan Yue let go.

388
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Is he going to the Cold Palace?

389
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Stop the fire! Tell me!

390
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Zhen Yu is a man of the Black Hand of the White Tribe.

391
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Chen Ye went to find Zhen Yu and got caught.

392
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
Bai Shuang.

393
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Get out of the way.

394
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
I don't have time to meddle with you.

395
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
The Hall Master must have his own plan.

396
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
Bai Shuang.

397
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Tian Hu.

398
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
You have your promise.

399
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I have someone I love to save.

400
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I have to go.

401
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Bai Shuang.

402
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Bai Shuang.

403
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Open the door.

404
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
I didn't complete the Hall Master's plan.

405
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Let me go.

406
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
His spiritual power is stronger than yours.

407
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
You can't stop him.

408
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
He trapped you in the cave.

409
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
He didn't want me to punish you.

410
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Besides, it's not your fault.

411
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
If not because Bai Shuang gave me the pill in advance,

412
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm afraid he won't recover so quickly.

413
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
The pill?

414
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
When did he give you the pill?

415
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
The day the Hall Master went to find the old turtle.

416
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
He asked Bai Shuang why he would leave blood.

417
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
He fought with him for a time.

418
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
He broke his rule.

419
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Your life is yours.

420
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
I'm your life.

421
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Why do you want to be tied together?

422
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
He came to the room to find me.

423
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,080
These are the pills I changed to the new prescription.

424
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,080
I don't know if it's useful to have a seven-star fire.

425
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
If he doesn't get the money,

426
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,080
he'll leave it to Haoyue Hall for other demons.

427
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Hall Master.

428
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
The Hall Master said he must have his own reason.

429
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
He has his own reason.

430
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
If he doesn't tell me,

431
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
how would I know what he means?

432
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
But you still have the pill.

433
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
You're not happy with it.

434
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
You still have the pill in your heart.

435
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
You still have the pill in your heart.

436
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
He always said I didn't care about my own life.

437
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
He didn't do it to save me,

438
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
but to care about his own life.

439
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Although he doesn't have the power to save me,

440
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
he has the foundation of the Four-Eyes and the White-Eyes.

441
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
You don't have to worry about it.

442
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Hall Master, you just recovered.

443
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Go to rest.

444
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
If he wakes up, I'll call you.

445
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Tianhuang.

446
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Tianhuang.

447
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Qi Feng has never forgotten who he is.

448
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to take the revenge.

449
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
The grudges of these years

450
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
are always hard to explain.

451
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Let the hatred and the death of Qi Feng

452
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
of Cang Shan

453
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
be destroyed together.

454
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,080
The Hall Master lost Cang Shan and Qi Feng's two brothers.

455
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
You're the one who's in the most pain.

456
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
How could Tianhuang be in the southern part of the world?

457
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
You're here to look after Uncle.

458
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,080
I want to send Qi Feng back to the tribe.

459
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
I'll go with you.

460
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
This time, I invite you all to come forward

461
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,080
to invite the disciples of the sect leaders to come.

462
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,080
I'll take the 72-th sect of the Immortal Sect

463
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,080
to destroy Lengquan Palace.

464
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Qi Feng.

465
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
The sect leaders are in great danger.

466
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,080
The Immortal Sect is not that strong.

467
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
But I have the power to protect them.

468
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
The disciples of the sect leaders

469
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
are not that weak.

470
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Lan Ling suddenly summoned the sect leaders

471
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
to come forward to destroy Lengquan Palace.

472
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Is it too impulsive?

473
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
I understand your concern.

474
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
That's right.

475
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
The 72-th sect of the Immortal Sect

476
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
is going to destroy Lengquan Palace

477
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,080
to make the Immortal Sect and the Demon Sect open.

478
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
The situation is big.

479
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,080
The fear will be dire and the innocent will be destroyed.

480
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
The sect leaders

481
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
will always be like me.

482
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
I've found out

483
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
that the two of us

484
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
are related to the Yin Clan.

485
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Impossible.

486
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
The Yin Clan has been destroyed

487
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
60,000 years ago.

488
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Sect leaders,

489
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
what did you get

490
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
from the news about the Yin Clan?

491
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Why are you asking me?

492
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Are you questioning Lan Ling and me?

493
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
I'm not questioning you.

494
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
But this matter is very important.

495
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
If the Yin Clan is really related to the Yin Clan,

496
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
the situation of the Taoist sect will be more serious.

497
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
If the Immortal Sect is not involved

498
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
and the money is being spent,

499
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
what else should we do?

500
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
What's the matter?

501
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
You...

502
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I said, he...

503
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Now is not the time to fight.

504
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Before, I was in love with the Demon Sect.

505
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
The real strength of Lengquan Palace

506
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,080
was that I didn't dare to easily go to the Taoist sect.

507
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
If I don't take this time,

508
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Lengquan Palace will be taken down

509
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
by the heavy window of the Hall of the Moon Palace.

510
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm afraid there will be no more opportunities.

511
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
The strength of the Moon Moon

512
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
is at this point.

513
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
But the power of the Demon Sect

514
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
of Lengquan Palace

515
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
is not easy to get rid of.

516
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
The words of Lengquan Palace

517
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
are just words.

518
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Who will see it?

519
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Who will see it?

520
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
What if this is the conspiracy

521
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
of Lengquan Palace and Hall of the Moon Palace?

522
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
It deliberately led me to the Immortal Sect.

523
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Then,

524
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,080
another king came to fight.

525
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
What is this?

526
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
What is this?

527
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
The Immortal Sect is right.

528
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
How can we just

529
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
take action with the news of some useless people?

530
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes. What if it's the trap?

531
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
This is really strange.

532
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
We still don't want to take action.

533
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Yes.

534
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
The Immortal Sect said

535
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
that Lengquan Palace was heavily damaged by the Hall of the Moon Palace.

536
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,080
I want to ask

537
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,080
where is Zhenyu now?

538
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Zhenyu has escaped from Lengquan Palace.

539
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
I don't know where he is.

540
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
You mean

541
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
he might have come back from the land at any time.

542
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
So, everything is unknown.

543
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
In my opinion,

544
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
before we find Zhenyu's whereabouts,

545
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
we should just keep quiet.

546
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Yes.

547
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Keep quiet.

548
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Keep quiet.

549
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Keep quiet.

550
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
You are awake.

551
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Where is Fan Yue?

552
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
You are like the Hall Leader.

553
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
You should go to each other at the first moment.

554
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
He must be hurt.

555
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
He is still in the coma.

556
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Did he fall down?

557
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I'll go check on him.

558
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
The Hall Leader took your medicine.

559
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
He is fine.

560
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
But,

561
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Qi Feng is dead.

562
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
He is sad.

563
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
He is in the secret room now.

564
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Don't worry about

565
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
the cooperation between Qi Feng and the other members.

566
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh, right.

567
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
I have to go to Lengquan Palace again.

568
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Xi might be there.

569
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Bai Xi is not in Lengquan Palace.

570
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I have been to find him

571
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
when you were in the coma.

572
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
But I saw him in Qi Feng's consciousness.

573
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
You saw the picture years ago.

574
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
There were many unexpected things.

575
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Besides,

576
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Lengquan Palace is heavily damaged.

577
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
It is scattered.

578
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
If your sister is in Lengquan Palace,

579
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
she might have escaped.

580
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Don't worry.

581
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
I have sent the secret detective

582
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
to keep on talking about him.

583
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Thank you, Tian Hu.

584
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
No need to thank me.

585
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Why didn't you tell them

586
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
that we asked Chongzhao to get Lengquan?

587
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
All these news

588
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
was from Chongzhao.

589
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
You saw it.

590
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
They didn't even believe me.

591
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
How could they believe

592
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
the news of Chongzhao?

593
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Now, the ancestors are in trouble.

594
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Once they know

595
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
that Chongzhao has the power

596
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
to take over the country,

597
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Chongzhao will return to the ancestors.

598
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
He will not be taken by the ancestors.

599
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
What's more?

600
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Sect Leader,

601
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
please tell us.

602
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Chongzhao said

603
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
that he was forced to practice

604
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
the magic of the Immortal Demon.

605
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Only by the magic of the Immortal Demon

606
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
can the magic of the Immortal Demon

607
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
be combined.

608
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Sect Leader said that

609
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
there is no only the demon power

610
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
in the body of Chongzhao.

611
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Immortal Demon is not easy to take over the clan.

612
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
If the other Immortals know

613
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
the magic of the Immortal Demon,

614
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
they will not even be able to save their lives.

615
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
This child is suffering

616
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
for Laning's life and death.

617
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
As the mayor,

618
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
how could we

619
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
push him into the dead end?

620
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
This old man is a coward.

621
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I will

622
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
return to the palace for Chongzhao.

623
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
But now,

624
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
I have to find Chongzhao first

625
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
and see what's going on.

626
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
We are also looking at Chongzhao.

627
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
We have to go too.

628
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
No, the situation is not clear now.

629
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
You take care of Laning.

630
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
I will protect Chongzhao.

631
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Remember, you must take care of Laning.

632
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
We will do as you say.

633
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Don't leave

634
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Don't leave

635
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
The last moon light

636
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
The last moon light

637
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
The last moon light

638
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
The last moon light

639
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
The last moon light

640
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
The last moon light

641
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
The last moon light

642
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
The last moon light

643
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
The last moon light

644
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
The last moon light

645
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
The last moon light

646
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
The last moon light

647
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
The last moon light

648
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
The last moon light

649
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
The light falls

650
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
and moves

651
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
and moves me to the far away

652
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Yuan

653
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
I am wrong

654
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
This time

655
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
I don't dare to tell

656
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
If everything doesn't happen

657
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
would we

658
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
be better brothers?

659
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,080
The same moon light

660
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Let's go, let's go

661
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
The endless long road

662
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,080
How to reach the sea of people?

663
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
The smoke and the wind, the quiet life

664
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
The moon light

665
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
The life is so long, what to do?

666
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,080
The time is so short

667
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,080
It's so long, how to get to the edge of the world?

668
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
I have to go, but I don't care

669
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
No matter how many times

670
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
I turn around

671
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,080
and leave

672
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Tian Huo told me

673
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
that when you are unhappy

674
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
he will come here

675
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
The mountain is gone

676
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
The wind is gone

677
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
You suddenly have a kind of

678
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
mysterious identity

679
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
So many things come

680
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
If it's me

681
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
I will be very confused

682
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
I know you are used to the city

683
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
But in front of me

684
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
you don't have to hide yourself

685
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,080
You said that we are family

686
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
When I was in the palace

687
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
I swear

688
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I will protect everyone around me

689
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I won't let the pain of the white seat

690
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
happen again

691
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
But in the end

692
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
I still let the mountain and the wind

693
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
leave me

694
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
And you are hurt

695
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Fen Yue

696
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
You are also a bloodthirsty

697
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
You will bleed and get hurt

698
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
and will be sad

699
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
There is nothing different

700
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
between you and the person you want to protect

701
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Don't take your wall

702
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
as a reason to blame yourself

703
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
You are the one who will comfort me

704
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Thank you, Nian Shuo

705
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Not only comfort

706
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
but also a watch

707
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
You only have one left

708
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
You can't take the wall

709
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Do you understand?

710
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
I will live well for you

711
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I promise you

712
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I won't let the one

713
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
who is not afraid

714
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
be a part of me

715
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
I see

716
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
So you have the fireflies

717
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
The autumn wind is blowing

718
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
and the leaves are floating

719
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
This is the last firefly

720
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
My heart is so excited

721
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Wait for me

722
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,080
I think you and this firefly

723
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
are very similar

724
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
The light and the night

725
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
are the hope of the darkness and the shadow

726
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
You mean

727
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I am your hope

728
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Your light

729
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
The light and the shadow

730
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
are the hope of the darkness

731
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
I am your hope

732
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Your light

733
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I am your hope

734
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Your light

735
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
The light and the shadow

736
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
are the hope of the darkness

737
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
I have heard that the gods are born

738
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Maybe you will live with them

739
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Since I am so important

740
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Then when I am old

741
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
You must be with me

742
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Take care of me

743
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
You must not die

744
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Ok

745
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
When I am old

746
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I will never leave you

748
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
You are saying this

749
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
to the world

750
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Yes

751
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
I will tell you

752
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I am willing to be like stars

753
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080

754
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
we are

757
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
I am willing to be like stars

758
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
and the moon

759
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080

763
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080

I'm so excited

778
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Wait for me

779

The stars are shining in your eyes

00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,080
You are the light I want to see

781
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,080
It's the lonely journey

782
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Let this moment last

00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,080
You are the blue earth in my life

786
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Let the tears stop when the spring breeze and the sun shine

787
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Let this moment last

788
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:51,080
