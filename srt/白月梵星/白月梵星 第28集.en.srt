No.

19

Master?

20
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,720
What exactly happened at Cold Spring Palace?

21
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,290
Why did Fan Yue suddenly attack it?

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,520
I don't know, Master.

23
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,180
At the time, the situation was dire,

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
so I had no choice but to leave first.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,700
Leaving was for the best.

26
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,820
Zhen Yu was defeated by Fan Yue

27
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,810
and fled with severe injuries.

28
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,840
This is already widely known.

29
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,030
After this battle,

30

Cold Spring Palace will surely remain in hiding for a while.

Yes.

You're out of your mind!

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,470
How could you involve yourself with a demon?

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,230
Fu Ling has saved me many times,

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,070
even at the risk of punishment from Zhen Yu.

44
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,430
Now, she has left Cold Spring

45
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,870
and has no further ties with Zhen Yu.

46

Please, Master, save her.

47
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,820
Even if she has left Cold Spring,

48
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,230
she is still a demon!

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,840
How can you forget all the wrongs she's done

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,700
just because you're feeling merciful now?

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,070
She's not a demon!

52

10 years ago,

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,130
Zhen Yu took Bai Xi from the Bai family,

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,820
erased her memories,

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,220
and infused her with demonic power,

61
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,700
turning her into a demon.

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,810
I've only recently found out that she's Bai Xi.

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,920
Why did Zhen Yu do this?

64

I don't know.

65
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,770
But Xi is innocent.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,900
She was deceived by Zhen Yu,

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,930
which led her to commit many wrongdoings.

68
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,900
She suffers from guilt now.

Fu Ling has done too much evil.

Even if she was once a human,

75
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,090
after becoming a demon,

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,770
everything she has done is her own doing.

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,230
Moreover, she now carries demonic power.

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,480
She has already become a demon.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,190
I cannot save her.

But you can't

84

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

Now, I'm neither an Eternal nor a demon.

98

Returning to Lanling will only bring it trouble.

you'll always be my good disciple

107

and a disciple of Lanling.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,180
Since you don't want to return,

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,180
then stay here in Ning'an City.

Fu Ling is no longer the Bai Xi she once was.

Otherwise...

that caused the ancient mirror to shatter even further.

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,740
What are you thinking about?

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,980
♫You are my first and last♫

176
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,170
A lot of things.

177
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
I'm thinking about the first time I came to Unbridled Pavilion.

178
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,450
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

179
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,250
I'm thinking about our first meeting,

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,250
about you teasing me,

181
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,840
and also about Tian Huo and Cang Shan

182
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,730
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

183
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,000
bickering here.

184
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,190
♫Let's never let go♫

185
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,980
And about Mu Jiu.

186
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,300
Unbridled Pavilion used to be lively and bustling.

187
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,730
I never thought it would be so quiet one day.

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Shuo,

189
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,410
when everything is finally settled,

190
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,170
let's return to Unbridled Pavilion

191
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,370
and reopen it.

192
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,140
If only Xi could come back.

193
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,260
We can definitely find her.

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,450
Take a look.

195
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,360
Fresh and good.

196
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
Yeah, come on.

197
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
Not bad.

198
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,430
Take one.

199
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,840
You're awake.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,100
I just made some steamed buns.

201
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
Try one.

202
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
As you said,

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,850
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,570
Now, I'm neither an Eternal nor a demon.

205
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,300
Returning to Lanling will only bring it trouble.

206
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,330
Xi is all alone now.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,990
I want to stay here

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,760
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

209
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,320
to be with her

210
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,030
and protect her.

211
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,400
Since you don't want to return,

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

213
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,660
then stay here in Ning'an City.

214
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,520
♫I remember that word of concern♫

215
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,640
This place is your home after all.

216
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,170
Go back

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,470
when you come around.

218
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,190
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

219
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,070
But...

220
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,230
Fu Ling is no longer the Bai Xi she once was.

221
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,740
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

222
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,880
Don't get too entangled with her.

223
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,790
♫It dried in the wind♫

224
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,060
Otherwise...

225
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,140
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

226
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,910
I've said all I need to say.

227
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,030
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

228
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,240
Take care of yourself.

229
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,410
♫That year, that year♫

230

♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

231
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,380

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,320
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

233
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,140
It's okay.

234
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,610
Looks like I'm out of practice.

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,580
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

236

♫That year, that year♫

238

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,400
Where are you going?

240
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,400
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

241
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,370
The poison in you hasn't been cured yet.

242
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm going to get some medicine for you.

243

♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

Xixi,

250
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,420
if you were still alive,

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,100
you'd definitely enjoy life here too.

why I was so good to Chong Zhao.

♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

260
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,620
a long time ago.

♫Another year passed♫

I wish I had remembered him sooner.

265
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,060
Unbridled Pavilion is open.

266
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,780
Is Shuo back?

267
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,060
Greetings, Divine Lord.

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,620
After all the twists and turns,

269
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,550
we're back in Unbridled Pavilion.

270
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,950
I wonder what Fan Yue

271
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,060
is doing now.

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Please.

273
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,510
Please save Xi.

274
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,300
If there truly are immortals in this world,

275
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,270
please, save Xi.

276
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,980
Souls destroyed.

277
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,120
Eternal damnation.

278
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,800
Those words

279
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,680
were actually uttered

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
by someone other than me.

281
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,970
She's already dead.

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,380
I never interfere with the life and death of any living being.

283

Saving you

284

was already an exception.

285
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,480
The next time I descend to the mortal world,

286
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,080
it may be thousands of years from now.

287
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,050
You, a mortal,

288

289

292

♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

343
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,260
Grandfather said

344
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,860
you have the Divine Mantle of the Demon Lord.

345
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,300
Then why was Jing Yuan

346
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,120
still in this world 10 years ago?

347
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,160
I don't know.

348
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,370
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

349
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,580
Just now,

350
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,690
a few memories of Jing Yuan flashed through my mind.

351
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,060
Maybe it's related to the purple moon's appearance.

352
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,530
♫To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart♫

353
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,310
But the one who saved you back then wasn't me.

354
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,250
For 10 years, I've been obsessed

355
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,790
♫I'm your wanderer♫

356
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,220
with seeking immortality

357
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,810
so I could find the person who saved me back then.

358
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,090
I know.

359
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,610
You've always been searching for him.

360
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,030
♫The flowers flew away♫

361
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,850
But Fan Yue,

362
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,200
when the Demon Lord saved me back then,

363
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,740
♫My tears are streaming down like rain♫

364
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,150
I was only 10 years old.

365
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,110
I'm grateful to the Demon Lord, Jing Yuan,

366
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,040
and have great respect

367
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,610
for him,

368
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,810
♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

369
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,970
but that's all.

370
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,130
The one I care about

371
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,250
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

372
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
and admire,

373
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,190
the one I feel joy seeing

374
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
and want to be with forever,

375
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,160
is you,

376
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,030
Fan Yue.

377
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,470
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

378
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm just so happy.

379
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,420
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

380
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,630
So happy that I finally found him.

381

♫My love brought tears♫

382
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,380

383
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,990
Do you understand?

384
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,520
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

385

Please bless the world♫To protect the world for eternity♫

389
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,980
Fu Ling.

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,930
What's going on?

391
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,320
Didn't you take the medicine?

392
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,120
Why is your condition getting worse?

393
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,730
I'll get you another bowl of decoction.

394
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,770
No need.

395
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,690
I just need to tough it out.

396
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,710
Why has your condition worsened despite all the medicine you took?

397
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,350
The medicine you took couldn't cure the poison,

398
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,460
right?

399
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,420
What kind of poison is in you?

400
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,890
Stop asking.

401
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,650
What the poison is

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,730
is none of your concern.

403
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,790
Fine.

404
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,350
If you don't tell me,

405
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,470
I'll go ask Zhen Yu.

406
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,480
No!

407
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,200
He'll kill you.

408
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,100
Then tell me

409
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,350
what the poison is

410
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,550
and how we can cure it!

411
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,260
Heart Devouring Poison.

412
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
It was created by Zhen Yu.

413
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,330
Except him,

414
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,800
no one else can cure it.

415
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,790
Normal medicine is useless.

416
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,310
Shuo has already returned to Ning'an City.

417
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,390
She can make pills.

418
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,410
I'll take you to Unbridled Pavilion to find her.

419
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,160
Maybe she can save you.

420
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
No!

421
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,170
I don't want to see her!

422
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,300
Xi!

423
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Xi.

424
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,150
It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,200
I can't...

426
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,920
I can't see Shuo.

427
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,630
I've sinned.

428
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,530
I can't see her.

429
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,480
I can't see Shuo.

430
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,270
I've sinned.

431
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,110
I can't see her.

432
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
I can't.

433
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,660
When we first found the Lunar Hidden Sea,

434
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,210
I saw a pendant on that person.

435
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,960
It was identical to the one the Demon Lord

436
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,220
was wearing when he saved me 10 years ago.

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,000
So I thought he was the one who saved me.

438
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,970
It turns out I was wrong all this time.

439
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,790
But when I went to the Lunar Hidden Sea for the second time,

440
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,630
why didn't he deny it?

441
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,150
By the way,

442
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,810
the pendant had a design

443
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,280
of the moon and fire.

444
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,320
In the memories you recalled,

445
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,780
did you ever see him?

446
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,640
No.

447
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,880
Do you think

448
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,920
he might be connected to the Demon Lord?

449
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,010
Who exactly is he?

450
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,700
Why was he by the Lunar Hidden Sea?

451
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,850
What did those words

452
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,530
he said to me mean?

453
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,690
There are still many things I don't understand.

454
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,270
Since he told you to activate the Contemplation Stone,

455
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,500
after we collect the Five Contemplations,

456
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,780
we may meet him again.

457
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,580
Everything will make sense then.

458
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,020
The tides of the Lunar Hidden Sea have ebbed and flowed for tens of thousands of years,

459
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,540
creating some crystals.

460
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,340
I found them interesting and collected them.

461
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,240
You don't like jewelry,

462
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,870
but this is made of stone.

463
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,350
Divine Lord, you won't refuse it, will you?

464
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,140
Who is she?

465
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,640
What is my relationship

466
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,420
with her?

467
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,020
Shuo.

468
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,400
Shuo!

469
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,290
Shuo!

470
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,430
Shuo.

471
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,440
She's been poisoned,

472
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,470
suffering unbearable pain every day.

473
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,530
Do you have any pills to ease her pain?

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,270
Fu Ling?

475
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,930
You can't kill her!

476
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,930
She's defected from Cold Spring Palace

477
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,400
and no longer serves Zhen Yu.

478
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,700
What does her defection have to do with me?

479
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,970
All I know is I must avenge my father

480
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,850
and the people of Ning'an City!

481
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,480
But she knows where Xi is.

482
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,490
Where is Bai Xi?

483
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,790
Put me down.

484
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,750
I told you I wouldn't come to Unbridled Pavilion.

485
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,510
I told you I wouldn't beg her.

486
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,260
Why did you still bring me here?

487
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,430
Make it clear.

488
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,150
Where is Bai Xi?

489
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,560
Since you know where Bai Xi is,

490
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,990
just tell her.

491
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,280
Yes,

492
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,880
I do know where Bai Xi is.

493
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
Bai Xi is already dead.

494
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,610
That weak, useless girl

495
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,620
didn't even have the courage to hold a knife.

496
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,890
She died the very first day

497
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,920
she came to Cold Spring Palace.

498
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,190
Impossible.

499
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
Xi was gentle,

500
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,880
but she was never weak.

501
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,650
She wouldn't have died just like that.

502
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,730
You're lying to me.

503
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,240
You're definitely lying to me!

504
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,050
Tell me where Xi is!

505
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,360
Fu Ling.

506
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,560
Fu Ling!

507
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,130
Shuo.

508
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,930
Save her.

509
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,680
Now that Zhen Yu has fled with injuries,

510
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,320
you don't have to stay in Cold Spring Palace anymore.

511
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,350
I don't know why

512
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,270
you're still entangled with Fu Ling,

513
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,960
nor do I care about

514
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,720
whatever ties you two have.

515
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,630
But giving her the pill is my biggest compromise.

516
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,420
Take her away.

517
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,290
Shuo.

518
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,900
Lately,

519
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,300
I often think about the days when we were little—

520
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,020
you, me,

521
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,050
and Xi.

522
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,920
I know Xi had been to Cold Spring Palace,

523
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,090
but Tian Huo went there to search

524
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,980
and didn't find her.

525
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,050
No one knows where she is.

526
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,530
She says Xi is dead,

527
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,930
but can I really believe her?

528
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
She's killed so many people

529
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,110
and done so many evil things.

530
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,850
-Actually, Fu Ling is...
-She even caused my father's death!

531
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,450
So, Chong Zhao, tell me.

532
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,020
She said Xi is dead.

533
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,580
Can I believe her?

534
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,810
Shuo.

535
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,620
I'm just like you.

536
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,250
I really want to find Xi too.

537
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,510
But there are many things

538
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,110
I can't give you answers for.

539
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,760
I've always felt that you're smarter than me,

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,620
that you see things more clearly.

541
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,240
Back then,

542
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,050
my parents and I came to Ning'an City and opened a steamed bun stall.

543
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,930
At first, I really didn't understand it.

544
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,520
We were Eternals

545
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,270
with the power to summon wind and rain,

546
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,460
change shapes, and move things at will.

547
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,160
Yet, we had to hide our identities,

548
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,430
suppress our power,

549
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,850
and spend every day just making and selling steamed buns.

550
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
Why couldn't we fight back when we were bullied

551
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,610
and mistreated?

552
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,290
Instead, we had to swallow our pride and endure.

553
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
During that time,

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,930
I argued with my parents every day.

555
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,700
And they scolded me every day.

556
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,610
At that time,

557
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,520
I wasn't happy.

558
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,740
If you're feeling really down,

559
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,200
why not have a good sleep

560
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,480
and dream a good dream?

561
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,820
When you wake up, it'll be a brand new day.

562
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,020
The sun is shining brightly today,

563
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,550
with a gentle, warm breeze.

564
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,310
When you're in a bad mood,

565
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,040
just soak up the sun.

566
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,900
The pear blossoms are in full bloom outside the city.

567
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,920
They're beautiful.

568
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,150
Take a trip when you have time.

569
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,280
It'll help you forget a lot of worries.

570
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,390
[In the early morning mist, the riverbank is shrouded in light rain,
with willow trees looking like a painting.]

571
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
At that time,

572
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,620
I often delivered steamed buns to your house,

573
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,060
so I recognized

574
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,290
that the sachet belonged to you.

575
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,430
Here, Xi.

576
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,140
If it weren't for you,

577
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
I would've wallowed in it for a long time.

578
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,400
I'm really thankful

579
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,680
for the comfort you brought me back then.

580
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,640
Now, I want to

581
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,160
return this sachet to you.

582
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,690
I never wrote you any notes.

583
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,770
It wasn't me

584
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,410
who comforted you.

585
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,720
But this sachet...

586
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,110
It was indeed mine,

587
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,530
but not long after, I gave it to Xi.

588
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,440
Could the one who sent you notes to comfort you

589
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,730
have been Xi?

590
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,950
I remember there was a time

591
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
when she would sneak out by herself.

592
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,260
When I asked her where she was going,

593
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,770
she wouldn't tell me.

594
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,300
It seems she was going to find you.

595
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,630
But I recognize your handwriting.

596
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,390
Xi taught me how to write.

597
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,910
I learned to write by copying her characters.

598
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,610
Naturally, our handwritings look similar.

599
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,720
If you want to know what really happened back then,

600
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,350
you'll have to find Xi

601
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,500
and ask her.

602
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,620
I don't believe Xi could have died like that.

603
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,410
Even if Fu Ling refuses to tell me,

604
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,030
I'll find Xi my own way.

605
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,250
As for Fu Ling,

606
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,960
just because she has betrayed Cold Spring Palace

607
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,560
doesn't mean the evil she's done can be erased.

608
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,160
For your sake,

609
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll show her mercy and won't kill her,

610
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,670
but I won't save her.

611
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,330
Take her away.

612
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
Shuo.

613
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,620
The Contemplation Stone lives up to its reputation as the divine object of Goddess Xing Yue.

614
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,210
Its power has wounded me so badly.

615
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,350
To repair the ancient mirror,

616
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,710
I need more power.

617
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,310
If back then,

618
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,020
that idiot turtle from Lanling hadn't deceived me,

619
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,910
I wouldn't have wasted so many years

620
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,400
and lost the opportunity.

621
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,810
Old Turtle,

622
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,640
you brought this upon yourself.

623
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,780
I will never let you off the hook.

624
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Fan Yue.

625
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,290
What's wrong with you?

626
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm fine.

627
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,730
You're lying.

628
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,140
You've been acting weird today,

629
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,750
like you're purposely avoiding me.

630
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,540
We're so close now.

631
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
You can tell me anything.

632
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,670
This is my master's turtle shell.

633
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,850
Master once said

634
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,210
he has many turtle shells,

635
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,930
but this one is always with him.

636
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,390
Now that he's sent it over,

637
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,550
something must have happened.

638
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,840
Old Turtle has always been in Lanling.

639
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,640
There have been no reports of an attack on Lanling.

640
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,420
The turtle shell is giving us a direction.

641
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,810
The east.

642
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,920
Shuo said those things

643
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,500
because she didn't know who you were.

644
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,920
She's been searching for you for many years.

645
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,520
Don't you want to be reunited with your sister?

646
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,480
The one she's been looking for

647
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,150
is her sister, Bai Xi.

648
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,120
But look at me now.

649
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,570
My hands are covered in blood,

650
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,740
and I've done too many bad things.

651
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,480
What right do I have to be Bai Xi again?

652
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
I'd rather she think

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,070
Bai Xi is dead.

654
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,030
But…

655
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,230
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

656
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,010
Then what about us?

657
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,980
The one who sent me notes back then was you,

658
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,050
right?

659
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,520
I don't want to talk about that either.

660
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,990
If you're feeling really down,

661
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,270
why not have a good sleep

662
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,810
and dream a good dream?

663
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,350
When you wake up, it'll be a brand new day.

664
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,340
The sun is shining brightly today,

665
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,920
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

666
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,900
with a gentle, warm breeze.

667
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,510
When you're in a bad mood,

668
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,300
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

669
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,720
just soak up the sun.

670
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,900
The pear blossoms are in full bloom outside the city.

671
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,290
♫I remember that word of concern♫

672
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,560
They're beautiful.

673
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,780
Take a trip when you have time.

674
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,130
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

675
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
It'll help you forget a lot of worries.

676
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,480
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

677
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Enough! Stop reciting them.

678
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,340
They were just some casual things I wrote.

679
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
♫It dried in the wind♫

680
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,820
I've long forgotten them.

681
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,780
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

682
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,350
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

683

♫That year, that year♫

684
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,020
Then, will these remind you?

685
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,260
I've kept every single one of those notes.

686
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,179
[The afterglow paints the rooftops and drifting smoke golden.]

687
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,179
[When you're bored, you can go to the riverbank to look at the sunset.]

688

♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

689
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,639
Over the years,

690
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,670
I've read them again and again.

691

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

692
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,520
I always thought the person from back then was Shuo,

693
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
and I've kept her in my heart ever since,

694
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,570
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

695
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,560

♫That year, that year♫

697
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,010
But it turns out

698
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,820
I was wrong from the start.

699
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,429
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

700
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,020
I liked Shuo

♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

702
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,500
because I was touched by these notes,

703
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,719
[The afterglow paints the rooftops and drifting smoke golden.]

704

[When you're bored, you can go to the riverband to look at the sunset.]

705
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,860

♫Layer after layer♫

710

I've been such a fool.

711
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,840
For all these years,

712
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,239
I didn't even know I liked the wrong person.

713
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,699
I told you,

714
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,330
I've already forgotten.

715
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,020
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

716
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,800

♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

718

Zhen Yu erased all your memories.

719
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,350
But even when you couldn't remember anything,

720
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,270
♫I remember that word of concern♫

721

you still showed me mercy and protected me.

722
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,330
It was because your heart never changed.

723

♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

724

♫I remember that drop of tear♫

00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,560

730

♫The one in the autumn wind♫

♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

I also have demonic power now,

743

♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

there are hibiscus flowers in the city too.

783
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,150
Why did you come all the way out here so early

784
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,310
to pick them?

785
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,280
Shuo and Zhao

love the hibiscus cakes I make.

The flowers here are the most vibrant,

788
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,200
so naturally, I came here to pick them.

Lingdang.

790
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,350
Go gather some dew.

791
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,930
Making the cakes with the morning dew

792
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,190
makes them the sweetest.

793
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,390
Yes, Lady Xi.

794
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,200

[Follow the way of heaven as the way. Practice kindness, caution, and harmony.]

804

807
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,300

Father.

813
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
I'll go ask Father to save Aunt Meng.

Xi.

815
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,100
Xi, what's wrong?

816
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Chong Zhao.

817
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,990
Your parents

818
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,010
weren't killed by a scorpion demon.

819
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,630
Before your mother died,

820
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,350
I met her.

821
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,400
What are you saying?

822
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,000
I couldn't see the person's face clearly,

823
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,270
but I vaguely saw that he severely injured your mother.

824
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,680
He also tried to kill me,

825
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
but I lost consciousness soon.

826
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,110
I don't know

827
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,360
what happened after that.

828
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,760
Don't return to Lanling?

829
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,580
Was she hunted down by someone from Lanling?

830
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
No.

831
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,060
I must go back to tell Master

832
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,370
and have him look into it.

833
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,450
No.

834
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,020
You can't trust anyone in Lanling.

835
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,290
Your master could also be the one who killed your mother.

836
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,250
Impossible.

837
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,040
My master and my parents had a deep bond.

838
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,030
If it were my master,

839
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,010
he wouldn't have raised me himself.

840
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,120
Anyone in this world might hurt me,

841
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,520
but my master would never.

842
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,440
Moreover,

843
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,300
my master has been protecting people his whole life.

844
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,090
He would never do such a thing.

845
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,420
[Bodhi Village]

846
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,690
The compass led us here.

847
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,950
Is my master

848
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,510
in this village?

849
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,380
Do you know this village?

850
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,160
I've never heard of such a place on the Eastern Continent.

851
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,220
But the compass is clearly pointing towards the village.

852
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,870
Why don't we go in and have a look?

853
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,230
A single village,

854
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,790
hidden in the mountains.

855
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,990
It's rather strange.

856
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,910
Stay close to me after going in.

857
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,290
Let's go.

858
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,560
Here, take it if you like.

859
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,630
-Old wine.
-Pumpkins.

860
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,720
Fresh pumpkins.

861
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,050
Take one with you.

862
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,290
-Take a look.
-Take one. Take one.

863
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,290
So fresh.

864
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,910
Thank you, sir.

865
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,510
It smells so good.

866
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,140
Why are there humans

867
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,500
on the land of the Eternals?

868
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,750
They all have mana.

869
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,310
They're not humans.

870
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
This village is not simple.

871
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,320
Be cautious.

872
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,110
Come look.

873
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,340
Miss, take a look.

874
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,110
Have a look. Fresh fruit.

875
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,820
Miss, come back again.

876
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,540
Thank you, madam.

877
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,110
Sir, the wontons are really good.

878
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,510
I'll pack some for you.

879
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,520
Take care.

880
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,790
Sir.

881
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,630
We were out for a walk

882
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,110
and stumbled upon this place.

883
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,110
May I ask where this is?

884
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,230
This is Bodhi Village.

885
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,670
You're here because you're meant to be.

886
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,020
Welcome.

887
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,990
Meant to be?

888
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,660
Yes.

889
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,510
This village is protected by the Divine Maiden.

890
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,510
Whether you're on the run,

891
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,550
homeless,

892
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,840
or seeking to avoid the mundane world,

893
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,800
if fate brings you here,

894
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,990
the Divine Maiden will take you in,

895
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,800
never asking about your past

896
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,670
and treating everyone equally.

897
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,520
The Divine Maiden?

898
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,880
That's right. This village

899
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,320
owes everything to the Divine Maiden.

[Food]

901

We were all saved by her.

902
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,710
Yes.

903
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,670
The Divine Maiden is not only powerful

904
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,510
but also very compassionate.

905
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,790
She's the kindest person

906
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,620
in the world.

907
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,010
If you meet her,

908
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,550
you'll definitely like her too.

909
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,280
Definitely, you'll like her.

910
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,840
Yes.

911
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,970
Yes, you will.

912
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,530
Let's go over there.

913
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Do you think the Divine Maiden

914
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,850
they spoke of is real?

915
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,040
Whether real or not,

916
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,000
someone who can hide so much spiritual energy

917
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,080
and keep it a secret

918
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,770
is definitely not an ordinary person.

919
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,410
Look.

920
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,900
The Divine Maiden is here!

921
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,980
I told you,

922
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,320
once you come to this village,

923
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
we're all family.

924
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,140
No need for formalities.

925
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,170
Just do your own thing.

926
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,460

I don't know.

What's Divine Maiden doing?

933
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,500
Is he the one

934
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,110
the Divine Maiden has been waiting for?

935
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,400
No way.

936
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,430
The Divine Maiden has been waiting for him all this time,

937
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,320
but now he has

938

another woman by his side.

939
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,480
The Divine Maiden must be heartbroken.

What does she mean?

we'll just get to know each other again.

why not let me get to know you as well?
