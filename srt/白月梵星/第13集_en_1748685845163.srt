1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
This might be what you combine with this.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,540
Thanks for watching andiendo!!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved one.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a stranger.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Eh?

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It deaths you first.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
I can visualize you would have mown this life.

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,400
Would you learn from those glurgling words?

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,540
SH your audience must be mesmerized.

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
RUN!

16
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,820
Intro

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Who will say that the world is far away from me?

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I will not be able to find the reason why I am here

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
I will not be able to find the reason why I am here

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I will not be able to find the reason why I am here

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
The End

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Episode 1

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Episode 1

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
When your father died, you couldn't do anything

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
You looked so sad, it really made me feel better

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will make you suffer

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The End

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Episode 1

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Episode 1

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Episode 1

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Episode 1

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will go with you

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Master, you haven't recovered yet

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can't risk it

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am already helpless

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You are making me look like a useless person

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,500
The more useless you are, the more you will not think that you are useless

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Don't say that again

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Then I will go with you

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I know that this palace is dangerous

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
But you made me look at you carefully

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Have you ever considered my feelings?

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,500
If you don't speak, then you are agreed

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you don't speak, then you are agreed

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Fire of Heaven is not here

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am not looking for the Fire of Heaven

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I am here to find Miss Bai

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are looking for me?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Miss Bai, thank you for saving my life last night

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will always repay you

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
The second one is not lying

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I will give it to you

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Take it as a reward

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Then I am not polite

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Do you think I am a coward?

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Oh, right

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
What did you just say?

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
The underground palace?

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
This one?

61
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
You stole the gold again

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
You stole the gold again?

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
No, I didn't mean it

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I was here to deliver the fire

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I swear I will never tell anyone

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
You are so stubborn

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
I am sorry, I am sorry

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,000
I am here to help you

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How can you help?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wait

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you really want to help?

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We are in the Dragon Immortal Garden

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But love is deep and the body is full of life and death

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right?

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The Fire of Heaven is not in the Garden

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
We don't need your help

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
We need his help

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
That bastard is so mean

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
He is so honest and he even believes in his lies

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You don't have to worry about Mu Jiu

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Just remember

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
No matter what happens tonight

85
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
You must protect the Palace Master

86
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I understand

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Actually our Palace Master has been living happily for so many years

88
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
If he can keep this kind of life

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
It's good

90
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
There is no such thing in the world

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,000
If the Palace Master didn't bury the person who was the only one

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He wouldn't be alive today

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Palace Master, I...

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I am not talking nonsense

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No matter who the Palace Master is

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I like him

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I respect him

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What was Fan Yue like before?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Fan Yue

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How did you fall in love with Bai Shuo?

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I...

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the whole process of the relationship between you and Bai Shuo

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
From the Palace Master to the Palace Master

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
To Lan Ling

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
To the current position

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know which part of the relationship is in love

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Palace Master

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't be fooled

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you sure you didn't show any details?

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Absolutely not

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Palace Master

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No matter what

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Bai Shuo's father's death

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It has something to do with us

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Although we have a relationship with Bai Shuo

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's all because of Wu Nian

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
We are going to walk on our own path

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Ah Xi

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
It's the night of Fan Lan

120
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Love is the most important thing

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
It's the night of Fan Lan

122
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Love, hate, murder, and greed

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know what the next thing is

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not sure what will happen

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But no matter what danger is

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not afraid

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But Fan Yue

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I only remember you

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You saved me

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You saved me

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You saved me

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You saved me

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You saved me

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Be careful

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why did you do this to me?

136
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Do you know that you might die?

137
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm fine

138
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I said I would protect you

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I remember this

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
And

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I still have you

142
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The four words of King of Jiyu

143
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Don't let him relax

144
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
We are demons

145
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
That's killing in the blood of the mountains

146
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
You will never understand

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
What our owner has experienced

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,500
The heart is like a rain of sand

149
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,500
The flower in the wind is like a water in the water

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Do you have to go into the palace?

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I have to go

152
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
It's because of Wu Nian

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Actually, there are some things

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
You may not say, but I can guess

155
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
You have been walking with demons

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,000
For the past five years, you have become stronger, right?

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Will you have the next year in the whole city?

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But it's my business

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Chongzhao

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I know you don't care about the Wutong Spirit Pill

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Stay in the inn

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't go to Fan Xian

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have what you want to do

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The Immortal Sect won't support you

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Shuo

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I will

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
What plan do you have today?

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
You don't know who said that the Wutong Spirit Pill is dangerous

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
It's still going

172
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Let's go

173
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Beichen

174
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
You know that the Wutong Spirit Pill is dangerous

175
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
You still have to go

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Miss Bai

177
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I know you are good

178
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
But Kunlunzi has been in a daze for a thousand years

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Recently, Chongjian has not recovered

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The Immortal Sect needs the Wutong Spirit Pill

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The Immortal Sect has come

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Although I hope it's not big, I can't give up

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will do my best

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Come in

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can't persuade them

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Kunlunzi has always been in a daze

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are not the same

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The responsibility of Lanling

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
is on you

190
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Let's go

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
We should go

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I can go to the palace alone

193
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
You stay in the inn

194
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Senior brother is absolutely dangerous

195
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
If we haven't come back after two hours

196
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Don't hesitate

197
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,000
Leave the city and go back to the inn

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes

199
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
One, two, three

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm done

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Good

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Good

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Miss Bai is done

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You must be happy next year

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Good

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Good

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Today is the Fenlan Festival

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The Immortal Sect

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Who do they wish to be?

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
To themselves

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
One person is a weapon of all

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And he can't beg for the immortal

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He wrote the wish on the lantern

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
To remind himself

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He must rely on himself

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's right

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In this world

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's better to beg than to beg

224
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Uncle

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Shall we go to the lantern too?

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Anyway, it's not the time for the banquet

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Take it

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is yours

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What did you write?

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Nothing

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have a secret in your stone

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm done

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If it's not the time

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There will be a battle

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This will be the most memorable scene

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've ever seen

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Uncle

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We are not lovers

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Right?

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I've asked the mountain

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
How we met

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Aqi

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sorry

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Everything that happened

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Your father

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Your father

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I wish I wasn't the one

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But I wish I was the one

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
At least he could protect me

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Come on

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come on

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's time to enter the palace

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Uncle

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know when he will come back

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Now

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's time to say goodbye

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thank you

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you angry?

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What happened just now?

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't remember

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Anyway, remember what I told you

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you are in danger again

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You protect yourself first

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I want to protect you more

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We must go back together

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Uncle, what's wrong?

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Nothing

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's too difficult tonight

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't force it

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I said I would help you

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I will help you

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No matter what happens

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's hard to be late

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You are welcome

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You are so good

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But this flower is too much

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We have two groups in our eyes

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We need two groups to come to the banquet

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The guest is very kind

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
As a fairy, he is very patient

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If it's not for the Wutong Spirit Pill

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a place for the people to live

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Who will come?

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Are you coming?

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The king is here

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that's all

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am late today

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
It's late.

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm late.

305
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,800
Allow me to accompany you.

306
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,680
Don't say anything more.

307
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,160
Hurry up, Wu Tongzhi.

308
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Turn the third fire into fire.

309
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Take out the winner of Wu Tong Wuyen.

310
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
You're so mean.

311
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't want to stay any longer.

312
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,920
Don't worry, first.

313
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Wu Tongzhi is in the wood box.

314
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,400
You all come to join Wu Tong Wuyen

315
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
for Wu Tong's spirit list.

316
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,440
The winner of tonight's event

317
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,400
can take the spirit list.

318
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,080
But I have something to tell you.

319
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,320
I've decided to open the city

320
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,280
after today.

321
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,320
Let the people enter the city.

322
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,960
From now on, the people

323
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
will not be trapped in this city.

324
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Please tell the people

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,600
what I've said after you go back.

326
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,040
In the future, the people will go to the world.

327
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,600
Please take care of them.

328
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,640
Don't make things difficult for them.

329
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,160
What are you talking about?

330
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,040
What are you talking about?

331
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,760
What are you talking about?

332
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,960
What are you talking about?

333
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
You can only have one person.

334
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
In addition to the city,

335
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,480
there are people, demons, and three hells.

336
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,680
Where else can we give the people the place?

337
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,440
If we want to leave the city,

338
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,760
we must have the place of the Heavens.

339
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,840
Is the prison

340
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,560
a place for the demons

341
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,760
or the gods?

342
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,720
The demons

343
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,760
don't have a place to be a human.

344
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,120
You are the first in the world.

345
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,240
You are in the world.

346
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Why are you here?

347
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,920
Right.

348
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Right.

349
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,280
Right.

350
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Right.

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
Right.

352
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
Right.

353
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Right.

354
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,200
The two demons

355
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,040
can't be a human.

356
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,000
Where is the city?

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,520
What I said just now

358
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,240
is just my idea.

359
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Since you all think it's not right,

360
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I will think about

361
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,280
the one who goes to the world.

362
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,400
Tonight,

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
we will finish the five-star show.

364
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,240
The five-star show

365
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,640
needs three different characters.

366
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,440
There is no one else

367
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
who can make the three-star show.

368
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,800
This...

369
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,160
This...

370
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
What is this?

371
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
What is this?

372
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
Look.

373
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
This is...

374
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
What is this?

375
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
This is...

376
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
This is...

377
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,760
This is...

378
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,680
This is...

379
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
This is...

380
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,960
This is...

381
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,040
This is...

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,200
Now,

383
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,080
we invite you

384
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,920
to our light.

385
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,440
Three

386
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,280
one

387
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,160
two

388
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,760
It wasn't great, really.

389
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
A scene.

390
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,160
The scene.

391
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,080
It was really great.

392
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,280
Isn't it great?

393
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,400
Really, it's beautiful.

394
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,800
It's really scary.

395
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,880
Why?

396
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,040
Shadow King,

397
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,680
this piper is fire.

398
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Why are you so HDR?

399
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,480
Are you conned?

400
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
You are a liar?

401
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
That's right!

402
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
The ceremony is not over yet.

403
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Everyone, don't be so careless.

404
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Miss Bai, please take out the two new firewoods.

405
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
What firewoods?

406
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What firewoods?

407
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
What firewoods?

408
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
How can you get two new firewoods?

409
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Isn't the firewood in Mujiu's hands?

410
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
New firewoods!

411
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
It's him!

412
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Give it to him!

413
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Bring it out!

414
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
What did he do with the firewoods?

415
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
It seems that nothing can be hidden from Yi Cheng.

416
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
This firewood is given to me by Mujiu.

417
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Is the rules of the Five-Eye Sect

418
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
prohibiting the firewoods?

419
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
That's not true.

420
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
What does that mean?

421
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
With the firewoods of the Chief,

422
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
do you still want to take it back?

423
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Of course not.

424
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
The firewoods of the Wu Tong Sect

425
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
are originally born to be one.

426
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
The third firewood

427
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,720
needs two more to be replaced.

428
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Bring it out!

429
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Bring it out!

430
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Bring it out!

431
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Bring out the two more firewoods!

432
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Bring it out!

433
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Bring it out!

434
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Bring it out!

435
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Bring it out!

436
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Bring it out!

437
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Bring it out!

438
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Bring it out!

439
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Whether or not the firewoods are gone

440
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
in the Blue Night

441
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
is the key to the main point of the One-Eye Sect.

442
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I heard that the Hu Clan

443
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
is the best at hiding and escaping.

444
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
You should go to the underground palace first

445
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
to see if Hua You is there.

446
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
If he is not there,

447
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
you can bring him in

448
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
as soon as possible.

449
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I see.

450
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
What about you?

451
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
The third firewood

452
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
will be born

453
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
with the first demon and the One-Eye Sect

454
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
to be one.

455
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
After the third firewood,

456
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I will go to the underground palace

457
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
to meet you.

458
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
No problem.

459
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I will take care of it.

460
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
But

461
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
you need to prepare two things for me.

462
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
One is the map of the palace

463
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
and the image of Hua You.

464
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
What's this?

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Go, go, go!

466
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Go, go, go!

467
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Search the door!

468
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Go!

469
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Open the door!

470
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Open the door!

471
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Open the door!

472
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Open the door!

473
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Open the door!

474
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Open the door!

475
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Let's go together!

476
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,820
Shit.

477
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,280
So lady, what did you think.

478
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
Sutra.

479
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,900
Now the three deities are finally請folded

480
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,200
Please be admirable, Your Majesty

481
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,820
So what may we bet the last winner is?

482
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,360
Five Top Sp還有無穴

483
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,920
It's exactly a battle with him.

484
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
What?

485
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
What is this?

486
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
What is this?

487
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
What are you doing?

488
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
What are you doing?

489
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
What are you doing?

490
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
What are you doing?

491
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
What are you doing?

492
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Hua Ting,

493
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
What are you doing?

494
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
All of you

495
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
You are family of seven

496
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Seven will be the right people

497
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Since you all are so unruly

498
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
I want the Yicheng to be your true afraid bone!

499
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
Spgaeduk.

500
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,400
What the hell?

501
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
What an Frost know?

502
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Huayong?

503
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Huayong?

504
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Does the King of the One Kingdom want to use the magic to trap him?

505
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Who is he trying to trap?

506
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
No, this is too suspicious.

507
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
We can't let Tianhua and Bai Shu come in.

508
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I have to take Huayun away.

509
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Where do you want to take him?

510
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
What are you doing?

511
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I told you, I'm the young master of Hu's clan.

512
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
But I have nothing to do with Yicheng.

513
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
My aunt will make the whole Yicheng feel safe.

514
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
As long as the plan is successful tonight,

515
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
don't say that it's just a normal place.

516
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Even if it's the whole Jingyou Mountain,

517
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
I won't let it go.

518
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,720
I have given you the last chance just now.

519
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
If you are willing to give Yicheng a life,

520
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I can give you a life too.

521
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
But unfortunately, you don't cherish it.

522
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Today's plan is all about self-cultivation.

523
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Huali, if you dare to act recklessly,

524
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
I, Hangyue, will never let you live.

525
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
The gold-gaining is limited.

526
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
If you have serious injuries,

527
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
you don't have to pretend to be fine.

528
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
As for this,

529
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I'll let you die here tonight.

530
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Huali, even if you kill the Immortal Demon today,

531
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
you can only relieve the hatred of the past.

532
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
The Immortal Demon will come to revenge one day.

533
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
How can the Yicheng clan be defeated?

534
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Tonight, I, the Yicheng Clan,

535
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
will never be trapped in this lonely city.

536
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I will never be defeated by the Immortal Demon.

537
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
There is no place for me to go.

538
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
There is no place for me to go.

539
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
All the rules will be decided by the Yicheng Clan.

540
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
What's going on?

541
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
What's going on?

542
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
What's going on?

543
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Who are you looking at?

544
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
You are not just trying to save the Immortal Demon.

545
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
What do you want to do with the Yicheng Clan?

546
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
You don't have to worry.

547
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
You will know the answer soon.

548
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Lord Yiren, I advise you to take your hands off.

549
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I will keep the Blue Spirit's disciple.

550
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Once you find out something is wrong,

551
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
you will immediately go to the top.

552
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
If you don't go out tonight,

553
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
the Blue Spirit's martial arts will be affected.

554
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I forgot to tell you all.

555
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
The Yicheng Clan has already opened.

556
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
The outsiders cannot enter.

557
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
The people inside cannot be out.

558
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
What are we going to do?

559
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Tonight, you can only die in Yicheng.

560
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Take them down.

561
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Be careful.

562
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Take down the Star Fire.

563
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Star Fire!

564
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Get me out of here!

565
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Star Fire!

566
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Ah Zhang, are you alright?

567
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
I'm fine.

568
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
I'll do what I can.

569
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Go.

570
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Go!

571
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
It's time.

572
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Go and get the Soul-Catching Stone.

573
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Only then can you save everyone.

574
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
You go to the underground palace.

575
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
I'll go to the Flower Spirit.

576
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I won't stop.

577
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I'll immediately return to the Star Fire.

578
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
If you are not aware of the Star Fire,

579
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
can you threaten me?

580
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
If the Star Fire is not important,

581
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
why do you have to let everyone go?

582
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
The Immortal Demon has already entered the prison.

583
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
You can immediately take down the Soul-Catching Stone.

584
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
But you have to take back the first two Star Fire from the White Beast.

585
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
That means you also need the three Star Fire.

586
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Even if you know what you want,

587
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
no one can stop my plan.

588
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Your plan is destined to fail.

589
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I've already arranged for it in the underground palace.

590
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Do you think that by taking me away,

591
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
can you stop all this?

592
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
What exactly are you going to do?

593
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Now that the situation is settled,

594
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I'll tell you,

595
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
I want the Immortal Demon to be the first one to be killed,

596
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
and then I'll be the Immortal Demon.

597
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Ji Tan?

598
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Where is Mu Jiu?

599
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
He didn't come in.

600
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
What happened?

601
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
This is the third picture of the Immortal Demon.

602
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
The bow,

603
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
the three Star Fire,

604
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Huayong,

605
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
and you.

606
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
It's all over.

607
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Why didn't you respond?

608
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
I'm sorry.

610
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Why didn't you respond?

611
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
It's Han Cha...

612
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
You're so heartless.

613
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
You're so dangerous.

614
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
You don't know what you're going to do in the Immortal Demon.

615
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Do you know that if you take the wrong step,

616
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,720
he won't even have the chance to die.

617
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
If I don't do this,

618
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I won't live for long.

619
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
No one can take the King of Yi's sword.

620
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,720
One person will be in the final.

621
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
One day,

622
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
you'll understand my choice.

623
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
You always think so yourself.

624
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Whether it's a few years ago or seven years later,

625
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
you knew that you'd give up on me,

626
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
and you couldn't stop me.

627
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
But you didn't dare to be protected by Mingyu.

628
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Now, you know that Huayong City

629
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
can't solve the real problem of the King of Yi's sword.

630
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
You don't dare to face it.

631
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Huayun,

632
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
you're a coward.

633
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
You're a coward who can't be trusted.

634
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
When I was little,

635
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
I used to stand on your shoulder

636
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
and even hold your sword.

637
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I'd hold the stars in the sky.

638
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
At that time,

639
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I really thought that my father

640
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,720
was the strongest hero in the world.

641
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
But why?

642
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Why did you become like this now?

643
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I've never

644
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
given up on your mother.

645
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
I've tried my best to save her.

646
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Save her?

647
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Let her jump into the crowd and trust you!

648
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
The Queen is dead,

649
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
and she's still alive.

650
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
It's a plan I've made with her.

651
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
What did you say?

652
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
She's dead?

653
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
I gave her the life-saving pearl.

654
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
She's still alive under the dragon.

655
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
She's still alive.

656
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
She should be alive.

657
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
But

658
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
when things are done,

659
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
there's only one step left.

660
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Let me

661
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
let you

662
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
let me

663
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
let you go.

664
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
No!

665
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
No!

666
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
No!

667
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Which step is left?

668
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Wu Zhao was cheated by the Shushi.

669
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
The pearl she gave me

670
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
is fake.

671
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Wu Zhao?

672
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Are you changing me, Queen?

673
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Why are you here?

674
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Didn't I ask you to guard the palace?

675
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
The palace is under control.

676
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
No.

677
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
I should say

678
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
the whole city is under control.

679
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Including the King and the Queen.

680
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Wu Zhao,

681
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
what do you mean?

682
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
I've been thinking

683
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
you're born weak and have a good temper.

684
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
You can pull out the whole family of the Yi-Demons

685
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
with the pearl of the Meijia.

686
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
No matter what you think,

687
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
you're not as good as me.

688
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Why can you be the King of Yi City?

689
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
If I don't do it,

690
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
let go of me!

691
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
You've been hiding your power.

692
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You're not a single man's skill.

693
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
You're a man of power

694
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
who can't be trusted.

695
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
You can work with Leng Quan Palace.

696
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
I can't do it.

697
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
You saved the Fulin last night.

698
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
You did it?

699
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
It's not necessary to hide it.

700
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Tonight is a good night.

701
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I'll take care of it.

702
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I'll take care of it.

703
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
I've said

704
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
I'll take care of it.

705
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
How can you be so strong?

706
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
You can work with me first.

707
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
In this city,

708
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
I have my own power.

709
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
What?

710
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Did you kill me last night?

711
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Don't touch him!

712
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I'll kill you!

713
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I'll kill you!

714
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I'll kill you!

715
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
I'll kill you!

716
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
You can't kill me last night.

717
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Don't touch him!

718
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
A demon king,

719
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
a man of power,

720
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
I'd like to give you my life.

721
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You have some skills.

722
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
You've cut my blood.

723
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Do you think I should give up?

724
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Then you'll kill me immediately.

725
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
You can do nothing.

726
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
I know you're so weak.

727
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
If I kill you,

728
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
will I be punished?

729
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
You're so smart.

730
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
I don't like you.

731
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
No,

732
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
I should say

733
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
I don't like you.

734
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Why are you so unfair to me?

735
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
You're the most important person to me.

736
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Just because of Wu Nian Shi?

737
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
It's not just because of Wu Nian Shi.

738
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
It's also because I think

739
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
your happiness is too much.

740
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
You may not know that.

741
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
It's not the first time we meet

742
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
in the city.

743
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
It's in Buji House.

744
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
There are many things that can be done together.

745
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I thought

746
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
people with no worries

747
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
should be more difficult.

748
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Feng Zi.

749
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Feng?

750
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
It sounds like a word

751
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
in my mind.

752
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
In this world,

753
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
it's better to be a good person

754
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
than a crazy person.

755
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
At least, it's painful.

756
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
For example,

757
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
now,

758
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
I want to play a game with you.

759
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Tonight, blood and blood

760
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
will fill the whole city.

761
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
The spirit will be in your dream.

762
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Death will come.

763
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
But I can give you a chance.

764
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Fan Yue.

765
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Chong Zhou.

766
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
You choose one.

767
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
The one you choose

768
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
is the one I can let go of.

769
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
A Shuang.

770
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Don't trust him.

771
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Feiyun.

772
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
I don't need your trust.

773
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
I just need you to choose.

774
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
If you don't choose,

775
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
they will all die.

776
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Bai Shuang.

777
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
You love each other.

778
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
I want to see

779
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
how you choose

780
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
between the two men.

781
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
What are you doing?

782
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
What are you doing?

783
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
What are you doing?

784
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
What are you doing?

785
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
How can we get out of here?

786
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
You're hiding it.

787
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Think of a way.

788
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
What are you doing?

789
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
What are you doing?

790
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Come out.

791
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
I didn't expect to come

792
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
to Wu Tong's dance.

793
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I even have to spare my life.

794
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Miss Bai has already

795
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
reminded me that

796
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
playing music is dangerous.

797
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I came to Fu Yan

798
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
to kill people.

799
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Why do you

800
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
have to come to Mingzhu?

801
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Why did you save me just now?

802
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
I just joined the group.

803
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
You haven't answered

804
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
my question just now.

805
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
What a pity.

806
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
What a pity?

807
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
I...

808
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
have a right-hand man.

809
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
He is born with zero pulse,

810
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
but he has no master.

811
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
I heard that Wu Tong has zero pulse.

812
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
He can repair his zero pulse.

813
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
So...

814
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
So you have to

815
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
act first

816
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
to get in a hurry?

817
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
No.

818
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
How long have you been

819
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
planning this?

820
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
How long?

821
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Since I was adopted by the Meijia,

822
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I have been

823
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
so stubborn.

824
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
You were a prince when you were born.

825
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
No matter how weak you are,

826
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
someone would think

827
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
that you can do anything to make you king.

828
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
But I was born with a low pulse.

829
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
I was bullied since I was a child.

830
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
I asked why.

831
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
They told me

832
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
that this is the fate of a man.

833
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
The fate of a man.

834
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
These scarves

835
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
were not left on the battlefield.

836
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
They came from the people.

837
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
I was a wandering street

838
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
and had already been poisoned.

839
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I had to rely on the Meijia to recover.

840
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
That's why I did

841
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
the work of the Meijia guards.

842
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
The grandfather is so close to you.

843
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Mother is so kind to you.

844
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
You are so kind to him.

845
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Uncle Liang,

846
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
when your mother was forced to die,

847
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
who was not kind to you?

848
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
To be honest,

849
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
she did not do anything to me.

850
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
But unfortunately,

851
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
I have to die

852
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
before she can block my way.

853
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
What did you do to her?

854
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
She was too clever to blame.

855
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Seven years ago,

856
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I was so angry

857
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
that I tried to push the people back.

858
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
But she found out.

859
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
You said

860
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
I could still keep her.

861
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I used a piece of paper

862
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
to cut off the six-word stone

863
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
in the back of the star.

864
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
I took her life.

865
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
But I underestimated

866
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
your love for her.

867
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
In front of the people,

868
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
you chose to send her away.

869
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
You had to change the plan.

870
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
It was you.

871
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
You used Hua You.

872
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Yes.

873
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
The one who exposed your mother's body

874
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
was not Hua You.

875
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
It was me.

876
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I used this crime

877
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
to expose Hua You.

878
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I just didn't expect

879
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
that when Meihan stood up

880
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
to face everything,

881
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
you still wanted to protect her.

882
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I could only lie

883
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
and find the armchair

884
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
to make Meihan die.

885
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
If you believed me,

886
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Meihan jumped into the room

887
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
and took all the secrets

888
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
and died in a hurry.

889
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Then I said I was cheated by the numbers

890
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
and didn't know

891
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
that the armchair was fake.

892
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
You believed me too.

893
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I didn't blame you

894
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,720
because you were Meihan's brother.

895
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
So you were the one who did this.

896
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
I killed you!

897
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
You can't die.

898
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
I haven't forgiven you.

899
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
I don't want you to die.

900
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
You can't die.

901
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Hua Lin is indeed a good father.

902
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Seven years ago,

903
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
you had to return the sword of the King of Yi.

904
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
You were hurt by the sword.

905
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
You thought you were lucky

906
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
and didn't die.

907
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Hua Lin sent you to the city

908
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
to help you

909
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
to keep your life.

910
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Only then can you meet Fan Yue.

911
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Why didn't you tell me?

912
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I want you to leave Yi City.

913
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I want you to leave Yi City.

914
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
After living a free life,

915
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
you will have to

916
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
bear the same grudge

917
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
as your mother.

918
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
I don't want to die.

919
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I don't want to die.

920
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I don't want to die.

921
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I don't want to die.

922
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I don't want to die.

923
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Listen to this.

924
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I don't want to die.

925
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I don't want to die.

926
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
I don't want to die.

927
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Mei Han is wrong.

928
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Hua Lin is wrong.

929
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Even you are wrong.

930
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Today, I will let you

931
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,720
see it yourself.

932
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Who can save the King of Yi City?

933
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
You still don't choose?

934
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
I have no patience.

935
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
I will choose

936
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
if I don't choose the third one.

937
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
One.

938
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
Two.

939
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Three.

940
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Four.

941
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Five.
