1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
TFS

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here, we are here.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The fairy demon is a stranger, you and her are not the same person.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm willing to be as a star, as a moon.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I only want to be with you forever.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The world is here, we are here.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We are together forever.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are together forever.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I only want to be with you forever.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are together forever.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We are together forever.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We are together forever.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We are together forever.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The fairy demon is a stranger, you and her are not the same person.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A Qi! A Qi!

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A Qi!

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why didn't you let her go?

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The moon lord has played this trick for so long.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I just want to ask for a favor.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Last night, I felt a soul in this love letter.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
After leaving the love letter, that soul-dreamed star attacked me and Bai Shuang.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The demon in the soul-dreamed letter is the same as the one I drew in the fairy demon's garden.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A Qi.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A Qi.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I dare not be absent-minded.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But looking at the fairy demon,

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think the person who buried the body is the lover of the fairy demon.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A Qi.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She actually appeared.

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, 800 years.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We are together in the same place.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now, the world knows that the person I used to love is no longer the same.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I didn't expect that the fairy demon is also one of them.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What a coincidence.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The fairy demon has played A Qi before.

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But A Qi doesn't have the fairy demon's luck.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The person in the lock can be around for a long time.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And can protect her for a lifetime.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The fairy demon came to get the medicine for the weak water.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To cure Miss Bai.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You are smart.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not smart.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just saw the appearance of love.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I saw Miss Bai's eyes.

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I also saw it.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What a pity.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's a pity?

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What happened that year

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
will make A Qi buried under the tree.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The love tree is crying? Why?

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Bai knows that

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the root of the love tree was the stone of the weak water.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The stone of the weak water is the treasure that the Hu tribe used to make the flower.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The power and the rhythm are far from the original.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
After 1000 years, the Hu tribe was lost.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The two brothers and I worked hard to make it.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We worked hard for many years.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was not easy to win the Hu tribe's loyalty.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But 800 years ago, the Hu tribe suddenly lost.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When did it happen?

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was yesterday.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I took the right side to the front this morning

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and saw all the leaves of the love tree falling down.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I used the spiritual power to check it.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's empty now.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you waiting for?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Close the door and stop the entrance.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No matter who stole it, the third one will be found if it's the stone.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All the tribes around us are worried about the Hu tribe.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If the tea of the Great Zhang Qi Valley is found by the people,

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the love tree will be in danger.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The Hu tribe is so hard to get over.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's too much.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But if the love tree is in danger,

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the back of the tribe cannot be planted in the middle of the love tree.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It can't be repaired.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If it goes on like this,

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the Mount Jinyou will be in trouble.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It can't be done.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you say?

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Use my life to fill it.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What do you mean?

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The one who provided the spiritual power to the love tree is just a spiritual power.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If the love tree provides spiritual power to the love tree,

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it won't be in danger.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The one who has the most spiritual power in the Hu tribe is me.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Without the love tree,

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will be dead.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Awu, don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You are the mountain master.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's because I am the mountain master.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have to solve this matter.

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You saw it too.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The tribes around us

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
are all worried about the past.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not that I am like my sister

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
who is not like the one who has the most spiritual power.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then you can't bet your life on it.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I am not betting my life on it.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I am tired.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ah Qi,

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
these years,

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we have been worried about the things

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the Hu tribe has done.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In their eyes,

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
it is all the fault of the right and wrong.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have been taken by them

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to the back of the tribe

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and to see their faces.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will give them my life.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So that they know

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that my sister never owes them.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The thing that was Rong Xian

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
was a tragedy.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Even if the Hu tribe wants to hate,

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
they should hate Rong Xian.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why blame Ling Long?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Even be angry with the mountain master.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't you know

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
that the evil in your heart

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is the most poisonous thing in the world?

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When Ling Long was still a Saintess,

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
those people were all

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
sad and sad.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They were all killed by the killing.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My sister became the sinner

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
who was killed by the killing.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ling Long loves Rong Xian.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She died for the sake of love.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If it wasn't for the things

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
between the Hu tribe and Kunlun,

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
maybe it wouldn't have happened.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
His love for her

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
became the most vulnerable of all.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He was scolded by the Jin family.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The hatred of the Hu tribe

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
became the one who hated me.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I should have known

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that I was a sinner.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But unfortunately,

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A Qi loves me.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She loves someone

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
who would use her own life

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to change her life.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A Qi!

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A Qi!

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A Wang.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I regret the most

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that I didn't see you

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
wearing that wedding dress.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No. A Qi!

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No!

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No!

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A Qi!

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A Qi!

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
After A Qi died,

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the mountain master passed away for a long time.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Without the brotherhood,

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I could only take care of the Hu tribe

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
with my own strength.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I could have let his life be without a day.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The Qin Shu has the food.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Naturally, it's too late to eat.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's how it is.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's been hundreds of years.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I thought everything would be safe.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But the brotherhood

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
is still a long way to go.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, the Qin Shu

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
started to push people

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to continue to gain spiritual power?

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We didn't find any signs.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Later, we found out

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
some foreign people came to visit.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Without the god of the mountain,

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the Qin Shu was destroyed.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The mountain master came to understand

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that the Qin Shu had A Qi's body.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
A Qi's life was a mess.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He was finally the mountain master.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, he wouldn't hurt the people.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But the foreign people were different.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If someone approached the Qin Shu,

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the love and hatred he had for the Qin Shu

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
would be seen as the illusion

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
of the death of the master.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You mean

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A Qi was the one who hurt the people?

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Qin Shu has become a monster.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's not my brotherhood.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There must be a miracle.

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Miss Bai,

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you saw my brotherhood in the scene.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You should feel that

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
he is a good person.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We brothers grew up together.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We can't say anything about him.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Maybe the others don't understand.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But Miss Bai, you can feel it.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I believe A Qi's true nature.

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But now,

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the Qin Shu is also a fact.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So,

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want you to find out this.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can let the 1000 years of honor disappear.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can also let my brotherhood

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
be destroyed.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Chang Wu will use everything

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to take the price to thank you.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Anything.

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No way.

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
After A Qi's trap,

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the spirit thought never appeared.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Last night,

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there was a blood relationship between Miss Bai and me.

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It must be the power of the Five-Thousand Poison.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a miracle.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Fan Yu, I don't want to fight

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
with that stone.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I really want to see A Qi again.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I promise

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I won't hurt Miss Bai's life.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I just need her to write a little.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I said it.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You promised to give me the stone

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
when you promised to give me the three days of honor.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You lied to me.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think you and A Qi are innocent people.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't be so stubborn.

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But you are also a person who understands Qin.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Can't you really kill us?

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The illusion that Rong Xian left

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
is the fate between you and us.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Can I beg you?

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I promise you.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Miss Bai.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You are a liar.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You are a rebel.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can't get up and down.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You have no right to help others.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I know what I'm talking about.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I know what I'm doing.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You are right.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We are the people who know A Qi the best.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She won't do anything to hurt others.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Do you remember what Ling Long said at the end?

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He wants A Wu to stay away from the war of the demons.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Take care of yourself.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Live a peaceful life.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But what does it have to do with you?

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is Ling Long's wish.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But A Wu

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
chose freedom for the Hu tribe.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But he chose responsibility.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If I can't help A Wu this time,

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I will be guilty.

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You didn't kill the Hu tribe.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You didn't harm A Qi.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You have no guilt.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I can help now.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Do you want me to stay away from the war?

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But you are a human.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You are a human who has been killed by A Wu.

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Master.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I knew you from Ling Long's mouth.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I also knew Ling Long was pulling my hand.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She treated me as the warmth of the sister.

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't know

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I had a sister.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now she is not with me.

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I believe

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
if Ling Long is still here,

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
if my sister is still here,

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
she will never see her sister.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
She is a human.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She has to suffer.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
She won't do anything.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The tragedy happened a thousand years ago.

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I am willing to help you.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Miss Ba.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Please forgive me.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We need to talk about something.

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Come out.

288
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
When will you hide from me?

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I didn't hide.

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I gave you the thing

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that Bai Shou gave me.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Where is it?

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I didn't see it.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shi Tou.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You are so bad at lying.

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You really have to hide from me.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You won't talk to me again.

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You don't like Mu Jiu.

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why do you want to talk to him?

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Even if it's fake, you shouldn't do that.

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I like him.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Make some time for me.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You just started it.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's just so little.

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I almost didn't know it.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But when you were with him,

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I felt nervous.

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I felt anxious.

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I realized that

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I liked him.

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
What about me?

312
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,880
What about the store owner?

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
We are still friends.

314
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,920
There is not only a man and a woman in this world.

315
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
You and I, me and the store owner,

316
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
are friendship.

317
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,720
Cang Shan,

318
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
we are just friends.

319
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,760
Can you give me

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,920
that wedding dress?

321
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
I don't know why but...

322
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,640
I don't think there's a engagement

323
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't tell anyone about it.

324
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
I will not accept this证.

325
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
Do you still remember the true meaning

326
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
of you

327
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,880
I still saved

328
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
my sister and me when I was a child.

329
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,240
We always give our lives to each other.

330
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,480
Her illness is very long and it can't heal me.

331
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,480
So I wanted to show my true self.

332
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Now you're on the way,

333
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
and send your life out.

334
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
It seems you've already left your head

335
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
with the grudge of the Jiang'an people.

336
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I know you're worried about me.

337
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
If the water is running out,

338
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
and the impurities are in my body,

339
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
I don't know how long it will last.

340
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
You know your own safety is not good,

341
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
so you just want to save me.

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Fei Yuan, I'm very grateful.

343
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Thank you.

344
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
But I have my own business.

345
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Chang Mei has lived in the old lake for a thousand years.

346
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
She's been saying that she's really good at breaking the rules.

347
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,480
A Qi's death is just a story that's been written with lies.

348
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
You don't suspect it at all?

349
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,480
She's hiding it from me.

350
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
The crisis between the Hu family doesn't concern me.

351
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
It's not a big deal to hear it from you.

352
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
But what if she's a different person?

353
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I know.

354
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
But I want to make it clear that the secret behind the love letter,

355
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
if you know that you're going to die,

356
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
you won't dare to take it.

357
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
You're a coward.

358
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
You're a coward.

359
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I can't even look at myself.

360
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,480
You should know this thought the best.

361
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
The seven stars are shining on you.

362
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
It's not a single move.

363
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
You've been afraid of it since you were killed.

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I did it because...

365
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Because you're strong.

366
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
You have the confidence.

367
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
But no one is strong enough to live.

368
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
It's even more so with a human like me.

369
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
If I don't practice myself,

370
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
and I don't break through the difficulties,

371
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I'll never become stronger.

372
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
So,

373
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,480
you know that you're not lying.

374
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
You want to join the army.

375
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Yes.

376
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Besides,

377
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
I have you.

378
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Master.

379
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,480
If you and I lie to Miss Bai,

380
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
if the Hall of Love knows about it,

381
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm afraid we won't be able to fix it.

382
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I didn't lie to her.

383
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Qi did give the love letter.

384
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm sure it's true

385
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
between me and Qi.

386
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
But if it's not lost,

387
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
she'll...

388
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Shut up!

389
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
When my brother died,

390
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
I had to protect Master.

391
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
These years,

392
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
in my heart,

393
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Master is Ah Jie.

394
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
She's Ah Cao Cao.

395
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
I know

396
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
everything Master did

397
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
was to make up for it.

398
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
But Qi is dead.

399
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
The love letter is blood.

400
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
So what?

401
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Miss Bai's blood

402
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
has caused the breath of the impure.

403
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
With blood,

404
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
it might make the blood worse.

405
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
If she's not Ah Qi,

406
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
she'll be in danger.

407
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
If I want her,

408
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I'll never let her go.

409
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
The last love letter was a cry.

410
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Qi gave her all the cultivation

411
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
and the love letter.

412
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
This time,

413
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
I wanted to go by myself.

414
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
But Fan Yue came.

415
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
I wanted to borrow her some spiritual energy.

416
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Maybe there'll be a chance.

417
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Now that there's a chance,

418
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
she'll come.

419
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Master,

420
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
you want Miss Bai's life?

421
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
I'll figure it out

422
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
if Fan Yue comes.

423
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,480
The food is just a treasure.

424
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
But it's the real God's food.

425
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
If Bai Shu is buried

426
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
under the love letter,

427
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
the love letter

428
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
will never be in the river again.

429
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Master, you're...

430
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
You're so naive.

431
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I don't know if it's useful.

432
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Even if it's useful,

433
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I won't agree with you.

434
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I don't have any other choice

435
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
until today.

436
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Xiaobao,

437
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I must do this.

438
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Let me go!

439
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm still a wolf.

441
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Let me go!

442
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
I made a mistake.

443
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Why are you so stubborn?

444
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm willing to watch you.

445
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
You're my aunt.

446
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Aunt, aunt, aunt.

447
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
You're my aunt again.

448
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
I didn't come to visit my parents.

449
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I thought I had a few books.

450
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
But who knows?

451
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
I was born as an aunt.

452
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
I've been living for 20 years.

453
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
I've been a criminal for half of my time.

454
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
I think I'm a man of the past.

455
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm a man of the past.

456
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm a man of the past.

457
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
You're a man of the past.

458
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Who's the one who's not married?

459
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
I don't know.

460
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I'm sure you have 8 or 10 orphans.

461
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
But you're the one who's the man.

462
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
You're the one who's the man.

463
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Now you're a great advantage.

464
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
You're the master of the mountain.

465
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Don't you think

466
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
people are jealous of your good fortune?

467
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Master of the mountain?

468
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
You're getting married.

469
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Why are you still talking about master?

470
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Cheng Lang.

471
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
You don't know how to lie to me?

472
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm not lying.

473
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Don't make a mistake.

474
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
By the way,

475
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,480
I have to go to the forest to find those two cold-blooded men.

476
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm not telling you.

477
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm leaving.

478
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm leaving.

479
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Don't go.

480
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Master.

481
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Tomorrow?

482
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Why?

483
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Didn't we agree?

484
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I'm a good friend of Tian Huo.

485
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
He's married.

486
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
I shouldn't be absent-minded.

487
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I promised you to let Qi out.

488
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
I'll let you two meet again.

489
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
I won't let you two get married.

490
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Why bother to care about it?

491
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
It's still late.

492
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Miss Bai should know

493
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
that they're getting married tonight.

494
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
The whole family will take care of it.

495
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,480
It's very important for me to be a good friend.

496
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
If I make a mistake,

497
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll be disliked by others.

498
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll be a burden to you.

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm a master of the mountain.

500
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I should be considerate of the tribe.

501
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Please understand my difficulties.

502
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
It must be tonight.

503
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Yes.

504
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Fine.

505
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Since you've said it,

506
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I'll have to buy it.

507
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
By the way,

508
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm wondering when Master will be born.

509
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
How old is he?

510
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
He'll be born in September.

511
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
But he'll be 20.

512
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Why are you asking this?

513
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm from the human race.

514
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,480
We should always talk about marriage.

515
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Let's ask him.

516
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Let's go.

517
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Changmei chose to be here today.

518
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
She must have something special.

519
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
What day is it today?

520
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
September 1st.

521
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Is there anything special?

522
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Changmei said that

523
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,480
the birthday of Mujiu is also in September.

524
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Is he going to be married today?

525
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
It's because Mujiu is the birthday of Mujiu.

526
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
He can't say that.

527
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Don't think too much.

528
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
I'll go with you tonight.

529
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
I'm here.

530
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
There won't be any changes.

531
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
I'll go with you.

532
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
You're here to attend the wedding.

533
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
The fire is out.

534
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
It's a fake.

535
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
But we have a date.

536
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
We should have someone to accompany us.

537
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
The words of the human race are from the mother.

538
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I'll accompany Bai Shu to the wedding.

539
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
You can stay with the fire.

540
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Why?

541
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Cang Shan.

542
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
Come with me.

543
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
When did you like the fire?

544
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
You...

545
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
You...

546
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
How did you...

547
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
How did you find out?

548
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
That day,

549
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
when you were young.

550
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
So you didn't want to attend the wedding

551
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,480
because you didn't want to see the fire and the others get married?

552
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
The fire has already been told to me.

553
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm not sure.

554
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
I don't know.

555
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
I don't know.

556
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't know.

557
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,480
We are just friends.

558
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Bai Shu.

559
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Why is Mu Jiu the one he likes?

560
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
And I'm just a friend.

561
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Friend?

562
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
I don't know.

563
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I just thought of seeing him and Mu Jiu get married.

564
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm just jealous.

565
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
You know the fire time is longer than mine.

566
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
What do you think he is?

567
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
He is a coward.

568
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Brave.

569
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
And he's smarter.

570
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
He's sensitive,

571
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
he's pessimistic,

572
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
and he's even a bit coward.

573
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
How can you say that?

574
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
That's not a lack.

575
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Maybe your owner is the same as him.

576
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
He's always been like that.

577
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Tiao Kuo has experienced so much before.

578
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
It's hard to trust someone.

579
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,480
You and Fan Yue have experienced so many things with him

580
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
and you are friends.

581
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Now Tian Huo is finally getting married.

582
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
He's willing to try Mu Jiu.

583
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,480
It's not easy to get married with him.

584
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,480
But he said it's just a trap.

585
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
You don't understand him.

586
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Even if it's not for this,

587
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
I always think that

588
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,480
it's not right to have Mu Jiu with Chang Mei.

589
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
It's not right.

590
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
If Chang Mei doesn't have any bad intentions,

591
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
if she really has a plan,

592
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
she won't let Tian Huo marry Mu Jiu.

593
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
I have Fan Yue here.

594
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,480
But Tian Huo has to face the whole Hu tribe alone.

595
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
You have to help her.

596
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
We can't worry about that.

597
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
So tonight,

598
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
do you want to marry him again?

599
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I hope not.

600
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Chang Mei's purpose is no matter what,

601
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
she's a poor person who's in a difficult position.

602
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
She may not have chosen many things.

603
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,480
If she really has a plan,

604
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
no one will win.

605
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
The Hu tribe's plan

606
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
is not the best.

607
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
It hurts.

608
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
It hurts.

609
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
It hurts.

610
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Young Master.

611
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Young Master, what's wrong?

612
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Hurry.

613
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Hurry and find me some medicine.

614
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Hurry up.

615
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Hurry up.

616
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Go and report to the Chief.

617
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Young Master, are you okay?

618
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
You're so stubborn.

619
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm lucky that I can hide.

620
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Huo. Huo.

621
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
You're here.

622
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
I was so scared.

623
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
I thought that my aunt and I were against you.

624
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
You look so pretty.

625
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
This dress suits you.

626
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
The hair is pretty.

627
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
The makeup is pretty.

628
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I mean,

629
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
you look pretty.

630
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Even if you have a bad temper,

631
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
you're still a good girl.

632
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Huo.

633
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Why don't you talk to me?

634
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Huo.

635
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Huo.

636
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Uncle Zhou.

637
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Have you forgotten the rules?

638
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Go back.

639
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Aunt, I'm not leaving.

640
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Let me see him.

641
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Tonight is your wedding.

642
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
He has a lot of things to prepare.

643
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Wait until the wedding,

644
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
and then you can take your time.

645
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Huo is not right.

646
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
He scared Uncle Zhou.

647
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Really?

648
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
You did it.

649
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
You're not going to die if you have a bad temper.

650
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
He's my life.

651
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
If you're going to hurt him today,

652
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
then kill me first.

653
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
What did you say?

654
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
I said,

655
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
please, aunt,

656
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
kill me first.

657
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Master, we...

658
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Get out of here.

659
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Aunt.

660
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I raised you personally.

661
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I was afraid of you being touched,

662
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
and afraid of you being sick.

663
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I've been reluctant to let you

664
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
suffer and suffer for so many years.

665
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
But in the end,

666
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
the life I've spent on you

667
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
was saved by you.

668
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
You saved an outsider.

669
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
In your heart,

670
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
do you have me, aunt?

671
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Aunt treats me well.

672
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I dare not forget.

673
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
But Ah Huo and all these are not related.

674
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
He shouldn't bear these.

675
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
He came to Mount Jin to kill you

676
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
because of Fan Yue.

677
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
They want to use the purple dew to

678
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
harm me.

679
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
They have never been hostile to the Hu Zu.

680
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
They've protected me

681
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
for several times in the city.

682
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Aunt,

683
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
I beg you.

684
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Please give them the dew.

685
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Shut up.

686
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I'll tell you one more time.

687
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
The dew is the truth.

688
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
One word is not the answer.

689
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Miss Bai.

690
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Miss Bai.

691
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Is the owner here?

692
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Master,

693
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
I've finally found you.

694
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Something bad happened.

695
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
What is it?

696
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
The Fire Demon Lord is in trouble.

697
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
The Fire Demon Lord

698
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
has been under a complicated spell.

699
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I wanted to help him

700
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
to get rid of him,

701
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
but I was wrong.

702
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
I had to use the magical power

703
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
to help him.

704
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I had to use the power of the power.

705
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
I asked you to go to Mount Jin.

706
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
The Fire Demon Lord?

707
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Why did you ask me to go?

708
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Maybe they're

709
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
the people working in the forest.

710
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Anyway,

711
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
the wedding is in a hurry.

712
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
If we can't get rid of the spell,

713
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
it'll be in trouble.

714
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Dalu.

715
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Miss Bai.

716
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
It's late.

717
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Can you go with me

718
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
to the Qing Shui?

719
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I'll go with you to the court.

720
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
No need.

721
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
I just need Miss Bai's blood.

722
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Whether the Fire Demon Lord

723
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
is going or not,

724
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
there's no difference.

725
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Is it true

726
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
that Miss Bai's feelings

727
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
for Ling Long

728
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
are false?

729
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Or is it

730
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
because she doesn't trust me?

731
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
You're joking.

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Please.

733
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you.

734
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Miss Bai.

735
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Master.

736
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Master, I'm here.

737
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I'm here.

738
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
You can save the Fire Demon Lord.

739
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
But you have to

740
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
follow my instructions.

741
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Tonight,

742
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
I'll let Master Changsheng

743
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
announce the location of the Mountain Lord.

744
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
If you refuse,

745
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I'll kill you.

746
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Do you understand?

747
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
I don't understand

748
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
why you're so

749
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
giving me the throne.

750
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm not telling you

751
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
about some things.

752
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
It's for your own good.

753
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
After tonight,

754
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'll let all the people

755
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
who might harm you

756
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
disappear

757
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
and then

758
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
you can understand

759
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
whether

760
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
I've promised

761
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
you something.

762
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
That's all.

763
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Sister.

764
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Isn't your aunt's sister

765
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Ling Long's daughter?

766
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
What do you promise her?

767
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
What does it have to do

768
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
with me?

769
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Aunt.

770
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
What's going on?

771
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
What's going on?

772
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Please hurry up

773
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
and let me know.

774
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
The spell is very powerful.

775
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I'm afraid it won't be too late.

776
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
The Heavenly Fire Demon Lord

777
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
is from the Hall of the Moon.

778
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Why does Elder Chang Wu

779
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
seem to be

780
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
even more anxious

781
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
than me?

782
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
The Heavenly Fire Demon Lord

783
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
is about to enter the Lake Tribe.

784
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
That's also Elder Chang Wu's clan.

785
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
The wedding is about to start.

786
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
If it's a matter of time,

787
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
the new person

788
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
will not appear.

789
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
It's not a big deal.

790
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
So

791
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
you've misunderstood me.

792
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
You think

793
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
we can talk in front of him?

794
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I really don't..

795
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
All right.

796
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
All right.

797
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Thank you, Old Master Chen.

798
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
We can't bother

799
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
such things now.

800
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Your ritual is trying to

801
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
suck.

802
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Mrs. Yu, she which was frail as a lake and her mentor all the time

803
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,620
teh

804
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:32,520
I wonder if she could even speak to you

805
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,760
Creach.

806
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,960
All in Langer Mountain?

807
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,620
Yes.

808
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,980
Long bolstering the village,

809
00:35:40,980 --> 00:36:00,540
ancons Her Tools of the Withering

810
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Yes, Commander Sun.

811
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,340
Let's go!

812
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,140
And another particles for you,

813
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,180
if anyone havn't agree to save our possib encounter,

814
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,100
they'll send me to investigate in a Bud hollow.

815
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:59,680
Not in the light of the train.

816
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,680
If Linglong is still here, I'm afraid she won't believe her eyes.

817
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,680
If Linglong is still here, I won't be the one to be the one to be the one.

818
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,680
If Shao Shi can be a little slow, that's because there's a sister who's always been there for me.

819
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
If someone is trying to block the rain, who wouldn't want to be a useless young girl all their life?

820
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Why does the mountain master always force the wine maker to be the one to be the mountain master?

821
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Why did he suddenly say the wine?

822
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Okay. Let's talk about Linglong.

823
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
The mountain master really loves elder sister.

824
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,680
These past years, he's been willing to give up his freedom and stay in the Mount Jin.

825
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
I've asked the Changwu Elder a lot.

826
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,680
The mountain master's position is a family of generations.

827
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Even if the mountain master is not a queen,

828
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,680
how can he choose to marry a concubine to the Hu tribe?

829
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Not a daughter of a fatherless mother who is 20 years old.

830
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Right?

831
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Miss Bai is very interested in the Hu tribe's family affairs.

832
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Today, we're here for Qi.

833
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Those old people should wait until they release the two of them.

834
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Let's go.

835
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,680
What's the hurry?

836
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,680
You've already removed the Fan Yue.

837
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,680
I've been waiting for you to come here for a lifetime.

838
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I should have told you clearly and not be late for the operation.

839
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
Miss Bai, what exactly do you want to say?

840
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I just want to ask, who is the one who's drinking the wine?

841
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Old fox, let me ask you one more time.

842
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Do you agree to the Young Master's position as the mountain master?

843
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Yes.

844
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,680
But is there anyone else who doesn't agree?

845
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
I don't agree.

846
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Cang Shan?

847
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Tonight is the big day of the fire.

848
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,680
I don't know what kind of small dishes you're making for the Hu tribe.

849
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,680
But I can't even go back to the wedding of the House of Houshui.

850
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,680
The wine is just a 20-year-old child.

851
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,680
It's the orphan of the Hu tribe's one-off mother.

852
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I'm just not related to her.

853
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,680
There are many ways to hide the age of the world.

854
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
For example, the age of a person's family.

855
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Even if they were born a thousand years ago,

856
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,680
they can still grow up 20 years ago.

857
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,680
You're so fair and you're so hard to be a big demon.

858
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
But it doesn't matter what happens.

859
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,680
The important thing is why?

860
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,680
After I heard that Mu Jiu and you weren't alone,

861
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
I thought for a long time.

862
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
The relationship between you and Mu Jiu

863
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
is really not something that no blood member can explain.

864
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,680
You're hurt and Mu Jiu is more than a mother who's more than a mother who's a father.

865
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
What's even more strange is that

866
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,680
the mountain master wants Mu Jiu to choose to stay here for a day.

867
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Why is it today?

868
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
I finally remember.

869
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
The first day of September.

870
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
A thousand years ago, it was today.

871
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
The head of the Dragon Heart, Gao Kunlun,

872
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
was killed by the gods.

873
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
He was killed by the Buddha.

874
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,680
It was also today that Linglong was killed.

875
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
It wasn't.

876
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,680
You are my Linglong.

877
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,680
It was the Five-Nin-Tian who brought us to the Dragon Heart Hall.

878
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
If I'm not mistaken,

879
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,680
it was Fan Yue who changed his life in the temple

880
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
and gave Mu Jiu a life-saving skill.

881
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
And the help of the Five-Nin-Tian

882
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
made Mu Jiu survive in the real world.

883
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Mu Jiu is Linglong's child.

884
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Cang Shan,

885
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
look carefully.

886
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
The Demon Lord of the Sky Fire is not here.

887
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Tonight is our family event in Jingyou Mountain.

888
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
It has nothing to do with you.

889
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
You're not talking.

890
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
What are you talking about?

891
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Mu Jiu,

892
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
the Heavenly Fire told me personally

893
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
that he likes you.

894
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
Although there is only one point,

895
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
although it was just the beginning,

896
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
but he...

897
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
he...

898
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
indeed likes you.

899
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Since he likes you,

900
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
you can make him happy.

901
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
If you become the Chief of this mountain,

902
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,680
no one can make him happy again.

903
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
So,

904
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
I don't agree.

905
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Listen to me.

906
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Take this person down.

907
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Chief!

908
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Step back!

909
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Cang Shan,

910
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
let go of the knife.

911
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
What are you doing?

912
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
If you have any good intentions,

913
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
I will kill you.

914
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Get out of here!

915
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Get out of here!

916
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
You're afraid Linglong's hatred and curse

917
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
will be on Mu Jiu.

918
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
So you tried to hide this secret.

919
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
You didn't even know how to change his age.

920
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
You chose this day

921
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
because Linglong's birthday is today.

922
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,680
You want him to see that

923
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Mu Jiu has grown up.

924
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
You want to return all of what I should have

925
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
belongs to Linglong.

926
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Miss Bai, you are really smart and scary.

927
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
You are right.

928
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
You and Chief Hao Yue

929
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
have grudges and gifts for Mu Jiu.

930
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,680
I shouldn't have done this to you.

931
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,680
But I have been hiding this secret for so long.

932
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I can't let anyone know.

933
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Your grace,

934
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
I will return it to you in my next life.

935
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
They dare not touch me.

936
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Go find Ah Hua.

937
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
My aunt is against him.

938
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
You must save her.

939
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Do you hear me?

940
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,680
The owner said that the strong should stay behind.

941
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
Go find Tie Huo.

942
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
If he says anything,

943
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I will kill you.

944
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Go.

945
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Chief Zhu, don't let him run away.

946
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Yes.

947
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,680
I didn't expect that we would be so stupid.

948
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
The foxes are so impulsive.

949
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Bai Shu should be taken away by Chang Mei.

950
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Let's go.

951
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Cheng Zhang, what do you mean?

952
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
You want to use Wu Nian Shi's power

953
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
to become the strongest demon.

954
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,680
If Chang Mei and Fan Yue die tonight,

955
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
you will be the strongest.

956
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,680
You don't need to tell me.

957
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,680
Are you crazy?

958
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
How can we kill Fan Yue and Chang Mei?

959
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Only I am not you.

960
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
You...

961
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Cheng Zhang, you are injured.

962
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
You are going to die alone.

963
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
I brought some of the evil spirits from the Fox Clan.

964
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
They are not fully trained.

965
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
But they need the power of the Immortal Demon.

966
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Don't worry.

967
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
I won't hurt you.

968
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Cheng Zhang, I can help you.

969
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
No need.

970
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
No need.

971
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
We are different.

972
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
We shouldn't be the same.

973
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
You can leave here tomorrow.

974
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
You are worried about me.

975
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
You are afraid that you will punish me.

976
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
Am I right?

977
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
Zhong...

978
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Zhong...

979
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
Zhong...

980
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
Zhong...
