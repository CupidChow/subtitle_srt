1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These stories are actually more than just creepy stuff.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Be prepared for the difficulties...

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm willing to be like a star, a king, a moon.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The world is here.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are here.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've never seen a flower before.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I only want to see every star with my beloved one.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to be with you forever.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fairy demon is a stranger.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You and her are not the same person.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm willing to be like a star.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want to be with you forever.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm willing to be like a star.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to be with you forever.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Go there first.

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,540
I need to go kill this one pää加油.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,700
bag

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Will be the death after all this life.

20
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Together, the dead should live out exactly whatever he wants.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The world is a mess.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going to kill you.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to kill you.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to kill you.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going to kill you.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to kill you.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to kill you.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going to kill you.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to kill you.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to kill you.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to kill you.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to kill you.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The world is a mess.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The last medicine that Fan Yue took today

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
will be recovered in the next few days.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe it will be in the next few days.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Two.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As long as we get it, we will have a chance to get it.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We can revive Chongzhao and others.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Three.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Fan Yue.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I choose Fan Yue.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The last medicine that I took today

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
will be recovered in the next few days.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Did you see that?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
After the death of Guan Tong,

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Bai Shuo still chose Fan Yue.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He never cared about you

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and never cared about you.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He never cared about you and never cared about you.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Chongzhao,

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you should see clearly

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
what kind of people and what kind of people are you.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You protect them.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When did they really protect you?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When did they really care about you?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why don't you just let me be cold-hearted?

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can't only be lucky,

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
but also be happy from now on.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can do whatever you want.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are so lucky to have the medicine.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Master.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you for the list of my medicine.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can let me use it temporarily.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have been doing this for many years.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have succeeded in the practice today.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yaojun, it's time to start the business.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you want to do?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The spirit bone that you owe to Hua Yong should be returned.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As for the seven years of practice,

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will take your life.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The fire of the heart is a fire.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The green garden is a tree.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The blood of the immortal demon is a dragon.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It can create a god.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
As a result,

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
it will have its own god.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Create a god?

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
When the five-year-old is still alive,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the night tribe will be lucky.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The night tribe will be lucky.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The night tribe will be lucky.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The night tribe will be lucky.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The night tribe will be lucky.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The night tribe will be lucky.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,560

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Over 60,000 sacred equids were killed.

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Ononononononononononononsis is appear in the gods' court until it is empty.

90
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,760
The конечно is always the arrack.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,760
God is the most complicated god in the world.

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,800
What do you do to help the winner?

93
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,400
A sea of buscarim Every night.

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400

How to open the Five-Negature Water?

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The god will suppress it.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Five-Negature Water is the god.

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
To restart the Five-Negature Water,

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
you must remember the secret,

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
the hatred, the hatred, the hatred, the hatred, the hatred, and the hatred.

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
What's this?

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Let go!

103
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Let go of me!

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
This bastard!

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Why are you being arrested?

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Yes.

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
The underground palace is in big trouble.

109
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Tonight,

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
all the fairy-tales will become the piece of art!

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
What?

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
What?

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
You're dead.

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
No!

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
It's working.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Hua Yong.

117
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Come here.

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm your master.

119
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Your highness.

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Even if Hua Yong becomes the god,

121
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
she will still be my master.

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
What's wrong with me?

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Why didn't you respond?

124
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm not a master.

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm just a master.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I don't want to be a master.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm an expert.

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I don't want to be a master.

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I don't want to be a master.

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
You're not a master.

131
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I want to be a master.

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
I don't want to be a master.

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
I don't want to be a master.

134
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Why didn't you respond?

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
It's because I'm not right.

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm not right?

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I'm not right.

138
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm not right.

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
What you taught me

140
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
is not a god-made thing.

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
It's a killing.

142
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
It's a killing.

143
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
It's a killing.

144
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
And Hua Yong

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
is just that killer.

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Wu Zhao.

147
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Actually, from the beginning to the end,

148
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
you're just a tool

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
that can be used for anything.

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Go away.

151
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Go away.

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Go away.

153
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Go away.

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Go away.

155
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Go away.

156
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Go away.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Go away.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Go away.

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Go away.

160
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Go away.

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Go away.

162
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
The steamed buns are dirty.

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I can't eat them.

164
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
My name is Mei Han.

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
What's your name?

166
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
You're so sad.

167
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
So,

168
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
why don't you

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
come home with me?

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Why is it that Hua Yong is the one?

171
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Then I have to thank you.

172
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Hua Yong is the best killer

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
in the world.

174
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
He can be strong enough

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
to pull out the King of the Yi Sword.

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Your goal is not to win.

177
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
How can you pull out the King of the Yi Sword?

178
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Of course, it's to open your heart

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
and get the Five-Thousand-Eight.

180
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
This King of the Yi Sword

181
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
is a silver iron

182
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
that was made by the first-generation Yi King

183
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
with the power of the gods.

184
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Other weapons can't be pulled out,

185
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
but this sword can.

186
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Hua Yong, pull out the sword.

187
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Fu Liang, let him stop.

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
The God Sword, the God Sword.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
This is your fate

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
to die here today.

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Hua Shu.

192
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Hua Yong.

193
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Hua Yong.

194
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Hua Yong.

195
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Hua Yong.

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Hua Yong.

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Hua Yong.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Kill you.

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Hua Yong.

200
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
The God of the Yi Sword.

201
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
How can you use your power?

202
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
The worst thing you did

203
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
was to drive the people out of the palace.

204
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Hua Yong.

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
What's going on?

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Why are you here?

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Don't go.

208
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Hua Yong.

209
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Hua Shu.

210
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Hua Zheng.

211
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Hua Yong.

212
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
The God Sword is here.

213
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
How can we stop him?

214
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You just have to pull out the sword

215
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
and make the sword.

216
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Hua Yong.

217
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Hua Zheng.

218
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Hua Yong.

219
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,400
This is the power of the God Sword.

220
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Hua Yong.

221
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Feiyun. Feiyun.

222
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
My Lord.

223
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
You're the King of the Demon King.

224
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
How can the King of the Demon King die?

225
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Feiyun.

226
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Feiyun.

227
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Feiyun.

228
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Feiyun.

229
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Feiyun.

230
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Feiyun.

231
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Feiyun.

232
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Feiyun.

233
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't cry.

234
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Don't cry.

235
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm just a little sleepy.

236
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I'll sleep for a while.

237
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
You've conquered the God Sword.

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
The God Sword is the master of the world.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Uncle Bai.

240
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
You can become a new King of the Demon King.

241
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I never wanted to be King of the Demon King.

242
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I just wanted to be myself.

243
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
It's good that he took the God Sword away.

244
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
In the future,

245
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
you don't have to do anything for the sake of the world.

246
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Hua Yong.

247
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
You can go your own way.

248
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Let me come back.

249
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Xiao Sen.

250
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Search over.

251
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
OK.

252
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll be amped.

253
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Once you are back,

254
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
you'll really develop your own destiny.

255
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You can starve your suit.

256
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Crown Prince Lidget.

257
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Crown Prince.

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Why is he still able to turn on the spiritual power?

259
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
What exactly is going on with him?

260
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm not sure either.

261
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Ask him when the Hall Leader wakes up.

262
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Take care of him first.

263
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll go.

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
You want to save Chongzhao?

265
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
He was taken away by the Fulin.

266
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I've already told the little disciple of the Lezhu to inform Lanling.

267
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Chongzhao is Lanling's first disciple.

268
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Let Jin Yaowu save him first.

269
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
It's more useful than you.

270
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Actually, you don't have to worry about his safety.

271
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I think someone will protect him.

272
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
What do you mean?

273
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,400
The Fulin's body is the one who saved Chongzhao's from the Emperor's return.

274
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,400
What kind of affection do you think Fulin would like to have?

275
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Besides, there are people who need you more.

276
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Tianhu.

277
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Someone is looking for you outside.

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Who?

279
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Sorry, Huaiyong.

280
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Sister.

281
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I caused you so much pain.

282
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
If I could come back earlier and face everything,

283
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
if I could believe you,

284
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
maybe Father wouldn't have...

285
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I wouldn't have been able to do anything.

286
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Maybe Father wouldn't have...

289
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
It's not your fault.

290
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I told you when you were little that I would protect you well.

291
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I didn't do it.

292
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
No.

293
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
You've been protecting me.

294
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
In the past,

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
you were the best person.

296
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Sister, are you still going?

297
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I have to protect someone.

298
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
But I will come back to see you often.

299
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
What are your plans after that?

300
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
The Yicheng will be rebuilt.

301
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I want to rebuild Yicheng with my people.

302
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Don't you plan to leave?

303
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
We used to be despised,

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
but we were also despised.

305
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
We always wanted to change our views.

306
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
We always wanted to change our views.

307
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
We were despised.

308
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
But I understand now.

309
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
The meaning of the Yiren is not determined by others,

310
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
but by ourselves.

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
As long as we live with confidence and courage,

312
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
we don't need to follow other people's views.

313
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
And now the power of the Five-Ninus Stone

314
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
has been integrated into the Yicheng's building.

315
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Yicheng has been promoted to the Yicheng's eternal.

316
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
The people want to rebuild Yicheng.

317
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
You've really grown up.

318
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Isn't it the same for you?

319
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Actually, I came to ask Miss Bai to be the king of Yicheng.

320
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
The King of Yicheng is the main one in the building.

321
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
He saved Yicheng.

322
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
We all hope that he can become the new king of Yicheng.

323
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Yicheng has a new king?

324
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
You are...

325
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
How can I?

326
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Why can't you?

327
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
The most important thing is to be righteous, righteous and close to the King.

328
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
You have all these.

329
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
You are more famous than anyone else.

330
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Compared to me, you are more suitable to be a Yiren.

331
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Hao You, I believe that you can lead Yicheng to a different path.

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Besides, I have to do something.

333
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I can't stay here.

334
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Miss Bai,

335
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Sister, I will protect this city.

336
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
If one day you are tired from walking outside,

337
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
you must remember that this is your home.

338
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Let's go.

339
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Feiyun.

340
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Wait.

341
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
You go out first.

342
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
No.

343
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Stop.

345
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Stop.

346
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Feiyun.

347
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
What should I do?

348
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
What should I do?

349
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
It's almost time.

350
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Now, it's only two stars from now on.

351
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Can I still be five years old?

352
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
What nonsense?

353
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Until the last moment,

354
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
there will always be hope.

355
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
What is he carrying?

356
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I saw it before.

357
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
I thought it was just a pattern.

358
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Actually, it's not.

359
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Right?

360
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You still refuse to say it until now?

361
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
He is taking my medicine.

362
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
He is my patient.

363
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
If you want me to cure him,

364
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
you must tell me his medical condition.

365
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Otherwise, how can I cure him?

366
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
The illness of the owner is not that he can cure me with his medicine.

367
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
What do you mean?

368
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Shi Tou.

369
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Look at the shopkeeper.

370
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Come with me.

371
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Do you remember the secret room

372
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
in the back store?

373
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Yes.

374
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I've been in the store

375
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
and I've been using the name card.

376
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Those names

377
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
represent the dead people

378
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
of the shopkeeper.

379
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I guessed some things

380
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
when I was in the hospital.

381
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I also understood

382
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
why he was so angry at that time.

383
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
But what does it have to do

384
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
with his illness?

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
The shopkeeper forced himself

386
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
to become stronger

387
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
in order to revenge.

388
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
He practiced

389
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
the magic of magic

390
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
when he was strong.

391
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
He was not able to attack

392
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
and attack the enemy

393
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
and caused a huge rebellion.

394
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
This is

395
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
the same as

396
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
the one who wanted to become stronger.

397
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
But the difference is

398
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
that he was the only one

399
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
at that time.

400
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
No one taught him

401
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
and no one protected him.

402
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Except for the practice

403
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
of the day and night,

404
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,400
he practiced the practice of life.

405
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
He was fearless.

406
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
The seven stars on the chest

407
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
were the rebels

408
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
who stayed there

409
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
at that time.

410
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Every drop of the star

411
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
was to be killed

412
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
and the soul was to be burned.

413
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
It was like this now.

414
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
The star was to be burned?

415
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
The name is still in the book.

416
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
The seven stars

417
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
burned the soul.

418
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
It's simple

419
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
but dangerous to die.

420
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Now he only has two left.

421
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
What does that mean?

422
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
It means the life of the shopkeeper.

423
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
There are only two chances

424
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
to die.

425
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Once the seven stars are all dead,

426
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
he will die.

427
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
How can we save him?

428
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Only you can save the shopkeeper.

429
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
As long as you have five years left

430
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
and you can open the Five-Year Deity Power,

431
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
you can eliminate the seven stars and the soul.

432
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
That's why you must

433
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
open the Five-Year Deity Power.

434
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I thought you were going to die

435
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
because of something else.

436
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
It's so hard and dangerous.

437
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
It's just to save his life.

438
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
The shopkeeper's life is all about

439
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
your own life.

440
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
No matter what price you pay,

441
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I will do my best to save him.

442
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
I've always been curious.

443
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
People say that the shopkeeper is cruel, cold-hearted,

444
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
and kill people like a snake.

445
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
As a woman,

446
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
you are willing to serve him

447
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
and be loyal to him.

448
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Have you ever doubted him

449
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
and doubted him?

450
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
That's because

451
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
you never understood the real shopkeeper.

452
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
You are a good man.

453
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
You are a good man.

454
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
You are a beauty.

455
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Hurry up.

456
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
He's dead.

457
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
But no one will care

458
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
if the world is a mess.

459
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
If you are not willing to be cleaned

460
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
and bullied,

461
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
then try your best to survive.

462
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Let's go!

463
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Let's go!

464
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Let's go!

465
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Shopkeeper,

466
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm in trouble today.

467
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
The fate of the Chou Yao Yi Clan is the line of the Wolf Clan!

468
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
People say that the owner is a murderer.

469
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
But they don't know that

470
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
sometimes his murder is just to stop the murder.

471
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Everyone is afraid of the Haoyue Hall.

472
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,400
But the powerful ones are never the monsters that were kept in the Hall.

473
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,400
And the owner is the one who can protect the weak and weak

474
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,400
in the strong demon clan.

475
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I follow the owner.

476
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
It's not because of his power,

477
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
but because of his compassion.

478
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,400
The owner of the Hall is the one who can protect the weak.

479
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
This time, from the start,

480
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
the owner chose to come to the Chou Yao Yi Clan

481
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,400
because he didn't want the little demon of the Hall to see his weak side.

482
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
He didn't want them to worry about him.

483
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
His strength is never to you,

484
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
but to everyone.

485
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,400
I don't think I really know him.

486
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
There is always a purpose in life.

487
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Someone is doing it for the sake of the owner,

488
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
someone is doing it for the sake of the lover.

489
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,400
But the owner only wants to live.

490
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I've been with the owner for so many years.

491
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I thought that there was nothing more important in his heart.

492
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
But now I'm not sure.

493
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
What do you want to say?

494
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
You know what I'm talking about.

495
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
The owner has been using your love

496
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
until now.

497
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
You know better than me.

498
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm going to marry you this time.

499
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
The layout of the Yicheng Clan

500
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
is not as good as I thought.

501
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
It's a bit of a waste to use the skill of the God.

502
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
It's a bit of a waste to use the skill of the God.

503
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,400
It's a bit of a waste to use the skill of the God.

504
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Fulin, tell me.

505
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
What is the plan of my clan?

506
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
The layout of the Clan is as detailed as the silk.

507
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
The silk is not wet.

508
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Not wet?

509
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,400
I'll take you to the Yicheng Clan.

510
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
It's Fulin's fault.

511
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm sorry for your mistake.

512
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,400
But the plan is not as good as I thought.

513
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
It's also the King of the City's fault.

514
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Please forgive me.

515
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
It's not as good as I thought.

516
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Master, I found the secret of Fan Yue in the Yicheng Clan.

517
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Everyone knows that the Yicheng Clan can't use its power.

518
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,400
But Fan Yue broke the Yicheng Clan's power

519
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
and destroyed the clan.

520
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
That's why the plan was broken.

521
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
The Wutong Five Pills has been in use for thousands of years.

522
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,400
The Yicheng Clan has been in use for thousands of years.

523
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Fan Yue is the King of the City.

524
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
It's not as good as I thought.

525
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Fulin, I'm lying.

526
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
You're the best.

527
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Fulin saw it in the underground palace.

528
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Fan Yue's chest is covered with a white-headed rabbit.

529
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
It's covered with a star.

530
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Then Fan Yue opened the door.

531
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
The star-shaped rabbit?

532
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes.

533
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,400
It seems that the star-shaped rabbit is hiding the Ghost Doctor.

534
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Get up.

535
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Go and find out what's going on with the Star-shaped rabbit.

536
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Yes, Master.

537
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Is it because the Star-shaped rabbit opened Fan Yue's chest?

538
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,400
As long as I train the Xie Chong,

539
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,400
the Xie Chong will be not bad.

540
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Tell me.

541
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
The Xie Chong needs the spirit of the 999-star demon.

542
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
The 999-star immortal.

543
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
The 999-star human family is together with the Xie Chong.

544
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
It can be broken by the soul.

545
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
No matter how strong the spirit is,

546
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
the Xie Chong will be controlled by the Xie Chong.

547
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
It's a loss.

548
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,400
It's hard to find a cure for the Xie Chong.

549
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
But it's easy to help me.

550
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Since the Xie Chong needs so many medicines,

551
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Fulin, can you forgive me?

552
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
You can do it yourself.

553
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Yes, I will.

554
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I heard that Fulin will bring the demon to the Cold Palace.

555
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,400
How about we make him the first face of the Xie Chong?

556
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Even my guest doesn't need you to do anything.

557
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Fulin promised to let Chongzhao be the demon within a month.

558
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
There are still five days left until the deadline.

559
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
If Chongzhao doesn't join the Cold Palace in five days,

560
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Fulin will personally give him the Xie Chong.

561
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
If he fails again,

562
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
he will be the first to get the cure.

563
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
You might be the second.

564
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
You can't even eat me.

565
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
A'Zhan!

566
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I said...

567
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Shiyi, you caught me.

568
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
This is the Cold Palace.

569
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Chua, have you forgotten?

570
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
The Emperor's Palace is in the middle of the night.

571
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
If it weren't for me,

572
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
you would have been in trouble.

573
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I want to go back to Yicheng.

574
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You still want to go back to the old uncle?

575
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
He only has Fan Yu in his heart.

576
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
You are going to die. Does he care about you?

577
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
I don't need you to care about me.

578
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I don't want to care about you.

579
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
What is this?

580
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
My body is a demon flower.

581
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It's him who saved you.

582
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Chongzhao, you have to pay for this favor.

583
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm going to die.

584
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I don't want to see your face.

585
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I don't want to see your face.

586
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Yicheng's Emperor's Palace,

587
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Bai Shou learned you were dead.

588
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
You have been so cruel to him.

589
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
You have been so cruel to me.

590
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
If that's the case,

591
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I will destroy all your worries.

592
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
If you love Bai Shou,

593
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
you will die.

594
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
If you want to go to Lantlin,

595
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I will let Lantlin live.

596
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,400
What do you want to do?

597
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
What do I want to do?

598
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Since I am in the land,

599
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Chongzhao, come with me.

600
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I will be your slave.

601
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
The old school is getting bolder.

602
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,400
How dare you kill me?

603
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,400
You even captured our hand.

604
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Chongzhao, please give me the order.

605
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
I will lead the army to rescue Chongzhao.

606
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
I will fight for the Cold Spring Palace.

607
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Can you be quiet?

608
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,400
If we really have the easy way to fight for the Cold Spring Palace,

609
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
there will be no chaos in the whole city.

610
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
But the Cold Spring Palace is always very spicy.

611
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Will Chongzhao...

612
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
No.

613
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
If Fuling really wants to take the life of Chongzhao,

614
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
he won't be willing to save him.

615
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Since the Cold Spring Palace saved Chongzhao,

616
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
maybe...

617
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Maybe what?

618
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Maybe Chongzhao is the step in the Cold Spring Palace's plan.

619
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
The step in the plan?

620
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
The fireworks are right.

621
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,400
The conspiracy behind the Cold Spring Palace is not as simple as the one on the surface.

622
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
The whole city is full of demons and limited-editors.

623
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,400
It's not like a pure lie.

624
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I will hide the secret behind the Five-Nine Stone

625
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,400
and the other secrets.

626
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,400
There are too many places now.

627
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
We need to find out the truth.

628
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
What plan do you have?

629
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
This matter needs to be done in a long time.

630
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
But I will find a chance to enter the Cold Spring Palace

631
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,400
and wait for the meeting to be done after Chongzhao.

632
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
You're awake.

633
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
You've been staying here all this time?

634
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Of course.

635
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I mean...

636
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Of course I will keep you safe.

637
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
If you die, who will drive the Five-Nine Stone with me?

638
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
I will.

639
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I will.

640
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
I will.

641
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Uncle!

642
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Yicheng, you're so clever.

643
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
How did you break the forbidden barrier?

644
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I was just kidding.

645
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Just kidding?

646
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
You can break the forbidden barrier for a thousand years

647
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
when you get there.

648
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Fengyuan, if you can break the forbidden barrier,

649
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,400
you will be related to your seven-star soul, right?

650
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I heard from the Fire-Headed Mountain.

651
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Don't blame them. I forced them.

652
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Tell me the truth.

653
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Did you use the Star-Demons to take me?

654
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
I didn't just save you.

655
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
If Yicheng was destroyed, Yicheng would be destroyed.

656
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Everyone would die.

657
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
But Yicheng has already been killed.

658
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
You didn't listen to me.

659
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I was the one who died.

660
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
You're asking so much.

661
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,400
What kind of answer do you want to hear from me?

662
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
How many do you remember?

663
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I remember everything.

664
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Then what about Mo?

665
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I remember everything.

666
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
That's what I remember.

667
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Yicheng, you're awake!

668
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Is it not time for me to come?

669
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
What do you think?

670
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
It's not time for me to come.

671
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
You really are coming.

672
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll ask your shop to get the medicine first.

673
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I have something to do.

674
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
What is it?

675
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
It's about the forbidden barrier.

676
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,400
This is the forbidden barrier you mentioned.

677
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
You don't make a big deal of business

678
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
and you don't do business.

679
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
It's not good to waste money.

680
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Why don't you use the Star-Demons?

681
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I bought this building.

682
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
You need to borrow money.

683
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Lan Ling is also the one who made my master do it.

684
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
You're demons.

685
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
How can you be like me?

686
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Besides, I'm not giving you the Star-Demons.

687
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Then who are you giving them to?

688
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm giving them to your shop owner.

689
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I don't like to owe people.

690
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
You saved me.

691
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I should be able to save you.

692
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Do you think your medicine will work?

693
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
There's no other way.

694
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
It's better to try it on me.

695
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
It's better than waiting for your illness.

696
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
You don't have to trust my medicine.

697
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
But you should trust my master.

698
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
You can tell him that he's a good man.

699
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
He's a good man.

700
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
No, I'm not.

701
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
The most time we spend on the building

702
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
is when we go back to the city.

703
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
You don't have to accompany me.

704
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I'll do it alone.

705
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm here to help you.

706
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I'll help you.

707
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
It's good to know that.

708
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
It's good to know that.

709
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
It's good to know that.

710
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
I've been following Ning'an City since the first city.

711
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Now I even dare to enter the chicken house.

712
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Do you believe that I broke your leg?

713
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
So you knew that I was following you.

714
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
It means that you still have me in your heart.

715
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Cangshan, go out.

716
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Cangshan,

717
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
go out.

718
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Sit down.

719
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Don't.

720
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Wait.

721
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Go.

722
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
I...

723
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Wait.

725
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I've spilled the owner's medicine.

726
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I can't take it.

727
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Is that so?

728
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I'm here to free myself from work.

729
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I can cook and eat.

730
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
You can tell me the truth.

731
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
If you don't know how to answer,

732
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
then you have to promise me.

733
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Let me go.

734
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Everyone,

735
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
we've been through a lot in Yicheng.

736
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I've given you the second brand of fire.

737
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
You're so good at taking care of your friends.

738
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Who's your friend?

739
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
You're so bad at playing the fool.

740
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Miss Bai,

741
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
put down your stone.

742
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I can't do it.

743
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
The owner of the chicken house.

744
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
You're so naive.

745
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
In Yicheng,

746
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
the owner of the shop is your friend.

747
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
If you make a mistake again,

748
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
I'll let Cangshan throw you out.

749
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
You've already thrown me out for three times.

750
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Why are you following me to the chicken house?

751
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
I like Ah Hua.

752
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
I'm staying with her.

753
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Are you looking for death, you stinky fox?

754
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
If I like you, I'll have to die.

755
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Then you can do it.

756
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,400
You...

757
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Can't you hide your feelings for this?

758
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
What's there to hide?

759
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Who's lucky and who's not?

760
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Then try to be with her.

761
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Besides,

762
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
I don't want to miss the short life of a fox.

763
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Then you can't stay.

764
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
You have to work if you want to stay.

765
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
You're responsible for all the dirty and tiring life in this chicken house.

766
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
If there's any mistake,

767
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
you can leave immediately.

768
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
You're a good owner.

769
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Thank you, owner.

770
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Ah Hua.

771
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Ah Hua.

772
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
You can untie her first.

773
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Miss Bai,

774
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
you'll be the same as the one in the house.

775
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Why are you bleeding?

776
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
I guess I slept too late.

777
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
I'm on fire.

778
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
On fire?

779
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
It's fine.

780
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I'll make you some tea.

781
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Come on.
