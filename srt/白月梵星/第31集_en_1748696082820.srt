4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,280
I am willing to be like the stars, and the army is like the moon.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
The world is here.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
We are here.

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I have never seen a flower before.

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
I only want to watch every sunset with the one I love.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I want to be with you forever.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
You and him are not the same person.

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,280
I am willing to be like the stars, and the army is like the moon.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
I want to be with you forever.

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
I want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
You and him are not the same person.

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,280
I want to be with you forever.

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,280
I want to be with you forever.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,280
I want to be with you forever.

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
We are together forever.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,280
I am willing to be like the stars, and the army is like the moon.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
I want to be with you forever.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I want to be with you forever.

22
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
I want to be with you forever.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
I want to be with you forever.

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,280
I want to be with you forever.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I want to be with you forever.

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Why do I feel that you are different from the past?

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,280
If he is not Xi, why do you want to save him?

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Give him some time, and give yourself some time.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
I will go to give the medicine to the teacher.

30
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Shuang, what did you see?

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I saw the picture in the last year in the Pu Ti Village.

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I saw my brother writing into the top.

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
As long as we can achieve the imperial painting,

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
we can reach the fifth year.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
The imperial painting is always in the top.

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Every time the imperial painting is hidden behind.

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
It may not be a star.

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,280
We have been through Nian City, Yi City, and the Great Wall.

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
We have been through the Great Wall.

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
We have been through the Great Wall.

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,280
We have been through Nian City, Yi City, Hu City, and the Great Wall.

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
In fact, every time the imperial painting is hidden behind.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Whether we are righteous or not,

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
whether we are pushing or stopping,

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
it will eventually reach the top.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
But it seems that there is a hand in the middle of everything.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
I think it's the same this time.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Fengyuan, we will never know

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
what will happen after we reach the top.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
But we will never give up.

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
After we parted from the old man,

52
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
what happened?

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Did you already achieve the fifth year of the imperial painting?

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
If you have already achieved it,

55
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
why didn't you mention it to me?

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
What are you looking at?

57
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Nothing.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
How did your hand hurt?

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I accidentally drew it for Master's key.

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
You accidentally?

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
What's wrong?

62
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Nothing.

63
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Leave it.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
The form is meaningful.

65
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
But the spirit is meaningless.

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Shuang,

67
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
what's wrong with you?

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Fengyuan,

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
you still underestimate the power of time.

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I used to be 60,000 years old.

71
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
But now I am 60,000 years old.

72
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I am 60,000 years old.

73
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I am 60,000 years old.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
I am 60,000 years old.

75
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I am 60,000 years old.

76
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I am 60,000 years old.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I am 60,000 years old.

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I want to hide it.

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
How could you easily find it?

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
I am Bai Shuang.

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I am the only one

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
who can keep you company.

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Take care of your本.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Don't forget.

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I gave you everything you have today.

86
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
I can take it back anytime.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
I am very capable of your kerf.

88
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
It will last over 3 years.

89
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I can see it from that taste.

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Let's sit down and have a good sleep.

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Get up.

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
First,

93
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
pacify your face.

94
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Give me your melody.

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
First,

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
act or follow my lead.

97
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You climbed to the place you are now.

98
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Your courage is not small.

99
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
You are so ridiculous.

100
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Don't be so excited.

101
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Once you and I fight,

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
the situation is too big.

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Aren't you afraid that

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
the secret of the Pu Ti Village

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
will be revealed to the public?

106
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Are you surprised?

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay.

108
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Then I will make it clear.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I once went to a place called

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
the Pu Ti Village.

111
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
I found that the outside of the village

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
is very special.

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
The whole front door

114
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
with the ability to set up the barrier

115
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
is only you.

116
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
I don't know what you are talking about.

117
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
You broke into my forest today

118
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
and killed the master.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
As long as I release the signal,

120
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
the master will be rewarded.

121
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Zhen Yu,

122
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
you don't have a chance to revive.

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
If you really want to do it,

124
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
you should have released the signal.

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
It's much more scary

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
than killing me.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Your secret will be revealed by other ancestors.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
That day,

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
after I left the Pu Ti Village,

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I sent someone to investigate

131
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
because I was curious.

132
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I found something very interesting.

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Do you want to know?

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
For nearly 100 years,

135
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,280
or since you became the leader of the forest,

136
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
every time,

137
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
there will be people from the ancestors

138
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
who are missing during the mission.

139
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
And then,

140
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
the soul lamp is dead.

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
But the strange thing is,

142
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
their corpse

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
is not found in time.

144
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Do you think it's a coincidence

145
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,280
or someone is doing it on purpose?

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
What's the connection

147
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
between the secret behind this?

148
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Do you think I should

149
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
remind the ancestors

150
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
of the good intentions?

151
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
But don't worry,

152
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I know

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,280
everyone in the world has a secret.

154
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I've already known your secret.

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Actually,

156
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I came today

157
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
to discuss with you

158
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
about the secret behind this.

159
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
What do you think?

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
As the leader of the ancestors,

161
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
how can I work with the demons?

162
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
The leader of the ancestors?

163
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
That's a great threat.

164
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
But what's the use?

165
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Can you do it with a single stroke?

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
You don't need to be a person.

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
The 72-star Immortal Sect

168
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
really trusts you and respects you.

169
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
And there are a few people.

170
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I'll tell you

171
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
that I've brought you a gift today.

172
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
This fish-pattern

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,280
records the whereabouts of the demons

174
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
and their weak points of life.

175
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I believe that it can help the leader

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
to strengthen his heart and improve his prestige.

177
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
From now on,

178
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
no one will dare to

179
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
know you anymore.

180
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
What do you want?

181
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
It's very simple.

182
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,280
You just need to kill the demons

183
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
and establish a good reputation.

184
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
And I just need to

185
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,280
take some small forces to heal.

186
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
To heal you?

187
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Isn't that a different thing?

188
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Once we cooperate,

189
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm not dangerous to you.

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm an assistant.

191
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
I can also help you

192
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,280
to get rid of someone's stubbornness.

193
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
In my opinion,

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
the power of the Shadow Lord

195
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
has been lost

196
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
over the past 60,000 years.

197
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
But you still have the power.

198
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Zhan Yu,

199
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
who are you?

200
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
It doesn't matter who I am.

201
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
What matters is

202
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
that we can cooperate.

203
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
This is the best choice

204
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
you have made.

205
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm not a person.

206
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm not a person.

207
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
There's one more thing.

208
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Please take care of the sect leader.

209
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Lan Ling, that old man...

210
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
He was sent to the Bodhi Village long ago.

211
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
The sect leader is also very unique.

212
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Look,

213
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
our goal is so same.

214
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,280
I will never let you down.

215
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Brother,

216
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
why are you here alone?

217
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
This person is old.

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
He always wants to be free, right?

219
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I don't know,

220
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
but I came to this Soul Light House

221
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,280
to see the old people.

222
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm not sure

223
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
if I can get rid of them.

224
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
But I'm not sure.

225
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm not sure.

226
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I saw the old people.

227
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
But when I came in,

228
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
I found out that those dead Soul Light House

229
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
had been left behind long ago.

230
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Although the Soul Light House is left behind,

231
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,280
their reputation will always be on the path of the Immortal Sect.

232
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
The future is like this.

233
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I will sacrifice my life

234
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,280
to get the best result

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
and get the best result.

236
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
I will be the one to take care of the future.

237
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
How many people will be left behind?

238
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
How many people

239
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
will be able to

240
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,280
really remember them?

241
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Yu Feng,

242
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
whether it's the demon or the immortal,

243
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
or the human,

244
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
you said that you will walk around the world

245
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
and leave something behind.

246
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
What's wrong with you today?

247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
You used to say that

248
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
you are the same as the immortal.

249
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
You should be more open-minded.

250
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
You should be straightforward.

251
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yu Feng,

252
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
according to the disciples of Blue Forest,

253
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
from now on,

254
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,280
the Immortal Sect will be replaced.

255
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
After they came back,

256
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
they kept avoiding the door and didn't step out.

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
They were trying to hide from me.

258
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
You said yesterday that

259
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
they might be the Kui Lei Sect.

260
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Is there a way to break the Kui Lei Sect?

261
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I know the secret of the Shang Palace

262
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
and I don't want to get in.

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
And what I said

264
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
is just a possibility.

265
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
We can't leave the village now.

266
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Why don't we stay and investigate it?

267
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
What's wrong with you?

268
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
What's wrong with you?

269
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Shui, I want to take you to her.

270
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Don't go there.

271
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
I don't want her to see me like this.

272
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Then I can't just watch you suffer.

273
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Let's go.

274
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
No.

275
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I've decided to walk with her.

276
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Why should we stay together?

277
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Ah Xi.

278
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Ah Xi.

279
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Ah Xi.

280
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I don't know if you can cook.

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I've never cooked for you.

282
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
It doesn't mean I can't cook.

283
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
It's from the past.

284
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I'll cook delicious food for you every day.

285
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Ah Shuang.

286
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Ah Shuang.

287
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Ah Shuang.

288
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
She poisoned me.

289
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Can you give her some medicine?

290
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I can't.

291
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
I can't.

292
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Let me go.

293
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Give me some medicine.

294
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
She can't live for a few days.

295
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
What do you mean?

296
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
She can't live for a few days.

297
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Her poison is in her heart.

298
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
It's useless to give her any medicine.

299
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
You're awake.

300
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Why are you so sad?

301
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Just a little pain.

302
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
It'll be fine soon.

303
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm sorry.

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
It's okay.

305
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm fine.

306
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
What's wrong?

307
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm fine.

308
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I'm fine.

309
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm fine.

310
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm fine.

311
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm fine.

312
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I'm fine.

313
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm fine.

314
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I'm fine.

315
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm fine.

316
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm hungry.

318
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Let's see what's delicious.

319
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I thought you were not well.

321
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
I thought

322
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
you'd be fine if you were too sick.

323
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I was too stupid.

324
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I was too stupid to prepare for you

325
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
and take you to the Cold Palace.

326
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I was so stupid that you were so useless for a long time.

327
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
I was so stupid.

328
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
You knew it all.

329
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I knew it all.

330
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
These days,

331
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I've been missing my master and my mother.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I thought I was being bullied.

333
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
But I didn't know

334
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
you were the one who was the most bullied.

335
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Chongcheng.

339
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
I don't want to hear you say sorry again.

340
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
This poison is heart-broken.

341
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
You can't take the medicine even if you take it.

342
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
If you take it,

343
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
you'll be poisoned in a month.

344
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I knew it long ago.

345
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I've already known the consequences.

346
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Giving up the antidote and leaving the Cold Palace

347
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
is my own choice.

348
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
It's not your fault.

349
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I'll go to Zhengyin.

350
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
I'll go and get the antidote for you.

351
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Chongzhao.

352
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Chongzhao.

353
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I don't want you to be controlled by Zhengyin.

354
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
I've been his guard for ten years.

355
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I know him very well.

356
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
As long as he's a good man,

357
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
he must be careful.

358
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
So don't go to him.

359
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Don't give him any more

360
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
possibility to use you.

361
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Thank you for taking me to the Cold Palace.

362
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I think I finally

363
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
have someone to live with.

364
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
So I'm not afraid at all.

365
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Don't be afraid, okay?

366
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
We've missed it for too long.

367
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
So we have to cherish

368
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
the time we spent together.

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I hope you can respect my decision.

370
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I'll be with you forever.

371
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Okay.

372
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
That year, that year

373
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I flew away for a long time

374
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm like a piece of paper

375
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I'm buried in my memories

376
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm left with no place to hide

377
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
The food is cold.

378
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I'll go and heat it up.

379
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
No need.

380
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
The house is not a hotel.

381
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Why are you like a stranger?

382
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
What do you think I should do?

383
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
His poison is the antidote.

384
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
I didn't say anything wrong.

385
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Instead of cheating Chongzhao,

386
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I should let him know the truth.

387
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Aren't you afraid that Fulin is really Bai Xi?

388
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
He didn't recognize him.

389
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Even if he is really Bai Xi

390
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
we will be separated for a long time.

391
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Even if I don't want to,

392
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
what can I do?

393
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
If you don't say that,

394
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
who are you?

395
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
The spirit power of this entry

396
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
is enough to make him sleep for a while.

397
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Don't worry, God Queen.

398
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
He's sleeping here very well.

399
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
He didn't show any spots.

400
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Spots?

401
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm never afraid of spots.

402
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
What do they suspect?

403
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Now that I've got Bai Shu's body,

404
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
and the spirit power is protected,

405
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
what can they do to me?

406
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,280
I feel like you're angry.

407
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
You think that

408
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
you can get the moon?

409
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Dream on!

410
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Then you're afraid that

411
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I was with the moon last night

412
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
and we were together.

413
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
And I was sick and lost.

414
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I will get what you can get.

415
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I will get what you can't get.

416
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I will take everything that belongs to you.

417
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Listen to you.

418
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
You're not only taking my body

419
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
because of the moon.

420
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
You're the first one to take my body.

421
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Because I hate you.

422
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I hate you since I was very young.

423
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
What do you mean?

424
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
We've met before.

425
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Keep looking at him.

426
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Yes.

427
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Hey!

428
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
You haven't answered my question!

429
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
How long ago?

430
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
How long ago?

431
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I'll get you one.

432
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
The Moon

433
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
It's late now.

434
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Why didn't you come out with Fulin?

435
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm going to the Cold Palace.

436
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
To find Zhenyu?

437
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Only he can cure the poison.

438
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Zhenyu is not the king of the Demon King.

439
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Even if he's not recovered,

440
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
you can't win.

441
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
You know the consequences of this.

442
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I don't know if I can come back.

443
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,280
So I have something to tell you.

444
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Actually,

445
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Fulin is Bai Xi.

446
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
You've always known.

447
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
You've always kept it from me.

448
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I didn't say it was your wish.

449
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I want to see your sister's heart.

450
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
You can have it.

451
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
But I have to misunderstand this.

452
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,280
She's not Bai Xi in this life.

453
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
I don't want you to meet each other

454
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
until the end.

455
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I don't want her to leave alone.

456
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,280
You're so kind to her.

457
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I don't want her to leave alone.

458
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
She's been in the Cold Palace for ten years.

459
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I've been in the City Hall for ten years

460
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
when she was tortured.

461
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm more grateful for her.

462
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
She's finally free.

463
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,280
It shouldn't be the end.

464
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
I must find Zhenyu to cure her.

465
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
If I don't come back,

466
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
please take care of her.

467
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,280
There are other ways to cure her.

468
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
If Fulin is Bai Xi,

469
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
I'll go.

470
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
It's easier for you to be together

471
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
than me.

472
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
You should be with her.

473
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
But the thing is,

474
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
that's the forbidden forbidden thing

475
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
that the Goddess has set up.

476
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Unless...

477
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Unless the Goddess doesn't exist,

478
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
the forbidden thing she set up will be cured.

479
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Brother, you're so great.

480
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
You're more than a thousand miles away.

481
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Under your military service,

482
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,280
those demons are so useless.

483
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Even those who were tortured

484
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
by the 72-star-spirited demons

485
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
were killed by Lan Ling.

486
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
This time,

487
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Lan Ling is finally

488
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
a dead end.

489
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,280
The evil plan is not to be taken away.

490
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
It's not to be taken away.

491
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
It's not to be taken away.

492
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
It's not to be taken away.

493
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Lan Ling is the first to be killed.

494
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
He's the one who's going to be the real culprit.

495
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
He's the one who's going to be the real culprit.

496
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Yes, I know.

497
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Of course I know.

498
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
But...

499
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Brother,

500
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
did you get any secret information

501
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
about the demons?

502
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Did you get it from Chongzhao?

503
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Let me see.

504
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Doshi,

505
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
don't you think

506
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
you want me to live like you?

507
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
We're the Goddesses.

508
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
We're definitely the Goddesses.

509
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll take my leave now.

510
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
What a secret.

511
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
It's so serious.

512
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Yufeng,

513
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
are you looking for

514
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
the feeling of the art of Lin Feng?

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I'm asking you something.

516
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
For the past few days,

517
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
you've been doing this

518
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
for the whole Lian Lian Li War Palace.

519
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Don't tell anyone.

520
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Okay.

521
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Jin Niu,

522
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I have eyes for you.

523
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Why did you leave after saying half of it?

524
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
I was just kidding.

525
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm not kidding.

526
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
What's the matter?

527
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Anything you don't understand?

528
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Doshi,

529
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I just have a feeling

530
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
that the demons have been against us

531
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
for years.

532
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
They'll always defend us.

533
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Don't you think

534
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
the Lian Lian War Palace

535
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
is a bit too smooth?

536
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Are you out of your mind?

537
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm not.

538
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Why are you talking nonsense?

539
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I'm the one who made the Lian Lian Li War Palace

540
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
to be a great hero.

541
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm the one who made the Immortal Sect.

542
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Isn't that good?

543
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Yes, it's good.

544
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
That's good.

545
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
You're so kind.

546
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
You're so kind.

547
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
You're so kind.

548
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
You're the one who came here.

549
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
How can you be so suspicious?

550
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
But I'm more worried.

551
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,280
You're more worried than you are.

552
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
No, I'm not.

553
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
I'm going to get back to sleep.

554
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
I can't give up.

555
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Fan Yue is still waiting for me outside.

556
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
And she's going to die for her sister.

557
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Don't waste your energy.

558
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
This Lian Lian Li War Palace

559
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
is what I call my power.

560
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
You're so impulsive.

561
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,280
Your face is really useful.

562
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Fan Yue is in love with me now.

563
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
She's full of love and care.

564
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
She's only me.

565
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,280
You think I'll believe you?

566
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I know Fan Yue.

567
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
You can't fool her.

568
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
She'll find me.

569
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
You don't have a chance.

570
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't need the body of the Lian Lian Li War Palace.

571
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
If my body is dead,

572
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
your soul will disappear with me.

573
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Uncle Bai,

574
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
everything you have soon

575
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
will belong to me.

576
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
You said you hated me

577
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
when you were a child.

578
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
But I never saw you before I entered the Bodhi Village.

579
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Luan Zhu,

580
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
did you really hate me?

581
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Of course I did.

582
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
You forgot your past.

583
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
But I didn't forget it.

584
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I'll always remember

585
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
what you did.

586
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
My past?

587
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Does my past have anything to do with the Shen Clan?

588
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
What do you mean?

589
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
You're about to die.

590
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Uncle Bai,

591
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,280
you're just looking at yourself

592
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
in the place where you don't see the sun.

593
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I'll become you,

594
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
replace you,

595
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,280
and possess your everything.

596
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
You...

597
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Tell me clearly.

598
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
What kind of past do I have?

599
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
What kind of grudge do we have?

600
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Shen Clan?

601
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,280
How could I be related to the Shen Clan?

602
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Shen Jun is the new minister of the world.

603
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Ah Yuan,

604
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
the new king of the world.

605
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I think our new moon...

606
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
From today on,

607
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
you are the Shen Clan of the本 army.

608
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Shen Jun,

609
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
this is the most mysterious

610
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
and mysterious cause of the Night Clan.

611
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
We've been together for a hundred years.

612
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
We've been together for a hundred years.

613
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
For the past hundred years,

614
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,280
you've been against me.

615
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
I've been loyal to you.

616
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
No!

617
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Why do I have these memories?

618
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Who is the person in my memory?

619
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Who am I?

620
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Lian Zhu,

621
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
he must know all the truth.

622
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I must get out of here.

623
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
I suspect you two

624
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
from the start.

625
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Please forgive me.

626
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Please forgive me.

627
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Don't be angry.

628
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Since you suspect me,

629
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,280
then you don't have to be so serious.

630
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
You have the right to ask for it.

631
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,280
You will kill Fulin tonight.

632
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Then let's start over.

633
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
His life is still useful.

634
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Shen Nui,

635
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
is the man in the back

636
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
a sick man?

637
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Why are you in a hurry?

638
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,280
His life is yours sooner or later.

639
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Thank you, Shen Nui.

640
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Look at my body.

641
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
No one has to come near it.

642
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Except Chong Zhao.

643
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Yes, Shen Nui.

644
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Lian Zhu is very strong.

645
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I've never seen him like this.

646
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Did he really fall asleep?

647
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
No.

648
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Why didn't you do it?

649
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Uncle, why are you here?

650
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm afraid you're in danger.

651
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Sister Mi Wu is the one who put the blame on her.

652
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
She's out of resistance now.

653
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Chong Zhang, kill her.

654
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Only by killing her

655
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
can you find the right person

656
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
to save Ah Xi.

657
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
To kill someone else,

658
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
it's not a good idea.

659
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
If Wu Jie Yao doesn't kill Ah Xi,

660
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
you don't care about her?

661
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Chong Zhang, there's only one way.

662
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
You don't have the choice.

663
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Kill her.

664
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Since you want to kill her,

665
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
why don't you do it yourself?

666
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
What are you doing here?

667
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
What do you mean?

668
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Why are you here?

669
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
You're looking for me?

670
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Have you met Uncle Bai?

671
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes.

672
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
What did he tell you?

673
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
You're suspecting Uncle Bai.

674
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
You're going to ask him this?

675
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
You're also suspecting him.

676
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
I was going to go to the Cold Palace to find Jie Yao

677
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
to say goodbye to Uncle Bai.

678
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
To confess to him that Ah Xi is actually Ah Xi.

679
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
But he told me that

680
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
only by killing a random person

681
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
can he leave the tribe.

682
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
But how could Uncle Bai let me kill someone?

683
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
He's not Uncle Bai.

684
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Then who is he?

685
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Where is the real Uncle Bai?

686
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
There's a number of times when he's in trouble.

687
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
But he can't be saved.

688
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
He can't be saved.

689
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
That's a lot.

690
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
There was a picture of Uncle Bai in the prison.

691
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Uncle Bai saw himself bleeding from the beginning.

692
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,280
I found the wound on his finger.

693
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
If I'm not mistaken,

694
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
his funeral was all from this beginning.

695
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
And before he met you,

696
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
he went to the Wanderer's place alone.

697
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Wanderer's?

698
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
You suspect that it's Wanderer's?

699
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
In this tribe,

700
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
whether it's the old lady, your parents,

701
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
or the others,

702
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
they're all suspicious.

703
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
This village is a mess.

704
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
If he's not in trouble,

705
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
he can't be saved.

706
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
If you come to me,

707
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm sure you have a plan.

708
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
If you want to save Uncle Bai,

709
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
you can't open your eyes.

710
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
If the other party leaves the place,

711
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
we'll save you.

712
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I didn't expect that I lost here.

713
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
You didn't lose this wound.

714
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
It's a new letter.

715
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
The real Uncle Bai won't lose his life.

716
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
He won't kill anyone for the purpose.

717
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Where's Uncle Bai?

718
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
He's changed.

719
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
I can accompany you

720
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
in the same way.

721
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Just like I was 60,000 years ago.

722
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I'll give you one last chance.

723
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,280
You have only one last chance.

724
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
You only have one last chance.

725
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
You want to wake up Wuniang.

726
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Why don't you ask me?

727
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
The power of god is weak.

728
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
I know where the last one is.

729
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
As long as you promise to give up Uncle Bai,

730
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
and stay with me,

731
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I won't tell you where the last one is.

732
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
What do you think?

733
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I'll open the Seven Stars Fire Flame.

734
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll make Uncle Bai come back.

735
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
To protect him,

736
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
you don't even want your life.

737
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I won't bother you with anything.

738
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I'll do it.

739
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
It's late.

740
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
You don't have to bring me here.

741
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
You don't have to bring me here.

742
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,280
You think you can hide your face

743
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
with the same face?

744
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,280
You don't look at the person who's closest to you.

745
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
You're just a heart.

746
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
What if we're fake?

747
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
You can't get out of this world.

748
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Have you heard of the Fulin Demon Lord

749
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
who killed people in the Cold Palace?

750
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
It hurts.

751
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
It's really what Kui Lei Shu did.

752
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
You can't win the god.

753
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
The fake that Si Xian drew

754
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
is not afraid of knives,

755
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
but afraid of fire.

756
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Don't, don't, don't.

757
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
What do you want to know?

758
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I, I, I'll tell you.

759
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Then tell me everything.

760
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Who is the loser?

761
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,280
What secret is in the Bodhi Village?

762
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,280
I'll tell you. I'll hide.

763
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Someone broke into the barrier?

764
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Zeyu, don't answer me in a hurry.

765
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I'll give you time to think it over.

766
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Shou is trying to get in and out of the barrier.

767
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
If he breaks out, he'll be punished.

768
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Let's ask him for a way out.

769
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
This is the secret of the Bodhi Village.

770
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Xuan Gui?

771
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Xuan Gui, wake up.

772
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Xuan Gui!

773
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Yixing.

774
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
I'll save you first.

775
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
How are you?

776
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
With your waist,

777
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
it's impossible to break the barrier.

778
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Xuan Gui.

779
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Duan'er, how come you're here?

780
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
It's dangerous here.

781
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Hurry up!

782
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
You haven't seen Master for a long time.

783
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
So I came to see you.

784
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
He's not a white-handed man.

785
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
You?

786
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
If I don't kill you,

787
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I can't block you.

788
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Fulin, it seems that you're not easy.

789
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
You're a mess.

790
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
It's really Xuan Gui.

791
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Even if I'm attacked by Lin Li,

792
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I can still use my eyes to see through the barrier.

793
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
What's wrong with you?

794
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Can't you see?

795
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I need his body.

796
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I need his everything.

797
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Don't hurt him.

798
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
You're my sister.

799
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Why don't you think about it?

800
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
I should call you Fulin

801
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
or Bai Xi.

802
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
You're Bai Xi?

803
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
You're going to kill me?

804
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Of course I'm going to kill you.

805
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
But without Bai Shu's eyes,

806
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I feel that I'm not happy.

807
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
What's wrong with you?

808
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,280
The End

809
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Tu'er!

810
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Bai Shu, you're so good.

811
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
You should watch it.

812
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Luan Zhu, if you dare to kill my master and Fulin,

813
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I won't let you go!

814
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
You can't even save your life.

815
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
How can you not let me go?

816
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,280
If you want to die, then die.

817
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Let me go!

818
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
I want to die for you.

819
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
From now on,

820
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
you still haven't sent the new ancestors in.

821
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
Your thousand years of spiritual power

822
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280
is the best remedy for your eyes.

823
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Master!

824
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Stop!

825
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Bai Shu, Bai Shu.

826
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
I want you to watch it.

827
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
The one who's in the heart

828
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
will die in front of you.

829
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Master!

830
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Stop!

831
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Stop!

832
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
Master!

833
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Master!

834
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Master!

835
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Master!

836
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Master!

837
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
A'Suang!

838
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
You're here.

839
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Let's go to Shandong.

840
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Master, it's dangerous!

841
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Master!

842
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Master!

843
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Master!

844
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Master!

845
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,280
The End
