1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I will try to get him.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
He has to pay his bill as well, I guess.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,100
Let's see how fast he will get.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,000
It has gone quite fast for Seitik to get there by herself.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He never actually got to it!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a king, as a moon.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The world is here.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only want to watch every star day with my beloved.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and him are not the same person.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I am willing to be as a star, as a moon.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I only want to be with you forever.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I only want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The world is here.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We are here.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We are here.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The world is here.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are here.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We are here.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I only want to be with you forever.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I only want to be with you forever.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You and him are not the same person.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We are here.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We are here.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The world is here.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We are here.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We are here.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We are here.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are here.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We are here.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Dongyang Guangyao is a great place to enjoy the new moon.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I just want to buy something.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is it?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A water stone.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No problem.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll give it to you three days later.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Lady.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Didn't I tell you to leave?

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A girl from the human clan said she was a friend of the moon.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No one in the tribe dares to come in.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why don't you let her in?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why didn't you fight?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is Miss Bai, who is very deep in her mind.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She finally sees the real person.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who asked you to come?

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't think I don't know what you're doing here.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If there's anything, just tell me.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Miss Bai is here on time.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The owner agreed to stay for three days in my tribe.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Since she's here, why don't you stay and have a look?

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Chang Wu.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Take two of the guests to rest.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't be late.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is interesting.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hu, aunt said she was a bit fierce.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But she didn't do it for you.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So, don't be too hard on her.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You'll know what kind of person she is in the future.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why should I know her?

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There are not many people in the three realms of the demon clan.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She likes me, she doesn't like me.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll just stay here.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But, she's a family after all.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And aunt is like my biological mother.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She's not even a little girl.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why can't she stay here?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hu, you're already like a tiger.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're already like a tiger.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't you think you have me?

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mu Jiu, you misunderstood.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Actually, I'm here to do something.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do something?

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Have you heard of Ruo Shui Stone?

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ruo Shui Stone?

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Forget it. You go back. I'll go find it myself.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hu.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I really like you.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a woman. I'm serious about you.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mu Jiu, do you know what you like?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course I know. I'm not only like you.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I also want to marry you. I want to live with you for the rest of my life.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Marry me?

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because I saved you.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's called gratitude.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Not liking.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because of gratitude,

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you have such a clear and clear mind.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You've been living with me for a long time.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can just leave anytime.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When you're heart is changed, you'll like someone else.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The sea and the mountain are always together.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I won't.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You will.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
People will know.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mu Jiu, you're younger than me.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You don't know much about this world.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're a lot of beautiful people.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The world is more powerful than me.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You and I are like a river.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But we've been together for days.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You don't even know my past.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't ever make this joke again.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hu.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who told you?

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't blame me.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What do you want Ruo Shui Shi?

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're an old lady.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What else did she say to you?

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We even have to argue.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Fine.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't argue with you.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
After three days,

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chang Mei will give Ruo Shui Shi to me.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is the end of the three days.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's dangerous here.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Go back.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You'll tell me everything.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is it that hard?

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You just need to trust me.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can trust you.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But respect is mutual.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Fengyu.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I thought you and I were different.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But why are you always like this?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Didn't you always want to know

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
where Mu Mu is better than you?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can tell you now.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's good at everything.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's kind and kind.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We don't need to guess each other.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you understand?

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The White House has arranged for you to stay.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Master.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You said that the Hall of the Moon

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
wouldn't be angry, right?

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Didn't you see?

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She's nervous that Miss Bai

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is acting like a pig.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
After three days,

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
we'll prepare the ceremony.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss Bai is better.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Fengyu won't be angry.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I still think it's more common.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Master.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why don't we

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
let her go?

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's give her a few grand gifts.

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's too late.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Fengyu is doing this for Ruo Shui Shi.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's useless to let her go.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ruo Shui Shi?

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not 800 years ago.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know what I know.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The Hall of the Moon doesn't know.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When the little wine is done,

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
it's ready to serve as a gift.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Moreover,

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Miss Bai is here.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The Hall of the Moon

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
is not a good place.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Maybe,

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
there's a chance

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that the love tree

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
will be in the future.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You don't want to use the Hall of the Moon

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to get the love tree.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The Hall of the Moon

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss Bai.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The Chief of the Mountain said

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you are the friend of the Hall of the Moon

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and the guest of Mount Jingyou.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Please accept the gift.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
a service of the Hu tribe.

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been a while

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to experience

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the scenery of Mount Jingyou.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll help you wear it.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The First Kill

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Changmei?

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's Awu.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How long do you have to kill him?

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What?

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're still not used to the days you write.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I see you're now holding the sword and

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the pain of killing him for the first time.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a lot of loss.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
From the first to the second,

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you're faster than I thought.

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't go back to the past now.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If you remember the demon,

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you don't have to keep the time to be pure.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You think you're pure?

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can be fake.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Just like your master, Shishu,

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
who's in Ning'an City,

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to make the Taiping Demon Lord's memory,

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
you go back and sit on the line.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't mention the past.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I've been in the demon.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I won't make a mess with you.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll make you pay for it.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm still thinking about the past.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's the last evil bug again.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What do you want to do with it?

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you know what a puppet is?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Once the evil bug is formed,

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
no matter how powerful the spirit is,

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
it can control the spirit of the new god,

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and make it a puppet.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That means you're still a puppet.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When did you get interested in these things?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Is it because

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you came to the Cold Spring Palace?

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's it.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just ask.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll let you know.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's okay to tell you.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The evil bug needs demons,

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
immortals and people.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
All 999 ways of training are successful.

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The demon's power is about to be enough.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's only a matter of people.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The more you kill the demon,

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the more power you have.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The more satisfied you are.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Maybe he'll call you back

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
after a while.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Fire of the Rain

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Feng Yu and Yan Huo,

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you two quickly report the news

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that Chong Zhao passed back to the Immortal Sect.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Please keep an eye on the location

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
of the disciples in the Sect.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Be careful.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Jing Lei,

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you lead the sect's disciples

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to the people's cities in the forest.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Chong Zhao reports that

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the evil bug in the Cold Spring Palace

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
is going to be in the city.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It will still be a threat to the people.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We have been in the forest for years.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We can't let the evil bug

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
be a threat to us.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't worry.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If the old bug comes,

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll kill him.

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Be careful.

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't be impulsive.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll do it.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Go.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Are you worried about Chong Zhao's safety?

260
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He's free.

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
His parents are gone.

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If it weren't for the situation,

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I wouldn't have pushed him

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
into the Cold Spring Palace.

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He could have been so secretive.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It seems that he has

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
gained trust in me.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm in a hurry to investigate this.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How much suffering does he have to suffer?

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Chong Zhao is so stubborn.

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He's also so generous.

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He's also doing this for the people's lives.

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He'll be in the Cold Spring Palace

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in the next few days.

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Chong Zhao will come back.

276
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I hope so.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Chang Mei agreed so easily.

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I also think it's strange.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If the water is still so clear,

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's a blessing for the people.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I shouldn't have thought so easily.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And when I pushed the water,

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
his color was not natural.

284
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Since I entered the Lake Tribe,

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've been feeling strange.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I didn't want to make the place

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
of the Chief of the Wooden Cove

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to be abandoned.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But why did you choose to stay

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
for three days

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
without the water being washed?

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Unless there's something wrong

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
after three days.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm thinking the same.

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll ask the Wooden Cove.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wait.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll go to the Wooden Cove.

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm afraid that

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll agree to marry the Wooden Cove

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
for the sake of the food.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I just hope that

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you won't make any decision

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that's against your own will.

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why are you laughing?

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're right.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What you said

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is more and more like a white beast.

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You didn't tell him

309
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
what he was doing.

310
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You didn't want him to choose.

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You've always been used to

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
dealing with everything.

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You've been used to protecting others.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But you forgot to tell him that

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
he's not a weak person.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's stronger than we thought.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's not weaker than anyone.

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So his path shouldn't be here.

320
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But you're not afraid

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
of him hiding it from you?

322
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's more hurtful than hurtful.

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's more hurtful.

324
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Tell him when you should.

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll think about it.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't be like this

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and be the master again.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll obey your order.

330
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not my order.

331
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Your order is the same.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
By the way, where's the master?

333
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm going to the lake to split the ice.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's almost time.

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I should be back.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What a strange man.

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He's been looking for him for a day.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He's been looking for the secret.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He's been looking for the secret.

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He's been looking for the secret.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He's been looking for the secret.

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Forget it.

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's go back to meet the master.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Let them think of a way.

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's go back to meet the master.

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Your order willöl

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
destroy them!

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I've an order!

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Who's that 뭔가?

350
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Water stone?

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Changmei is A'wu, Linglong's sister.

352
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I won't admit her to the team.

353
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's weird. Linglong only has Changmei as a sister.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But Mujiu is his aunt.

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Who is Mujiu's parents?

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
In the Dragon's Mirror, you acted as Changmei's guard, Aqi.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You acted as a guard, Aqi.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why are these two people gone now?

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Forget it.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Changmei's matter has nothing to do with Water Stone.

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't make any sense.

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Uncle Bai,

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have something to tell you.

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The reason I came to see Water Stone is because...

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What's wrong?

366
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Uncle Bai.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Uncle Bai, what did you see?

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
San'en, don't go.

369
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Uncle Bai.

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Master.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We met last time in Ning'an City.

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But at that time,

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the Immortal Army was still looking for me.

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is the first time I saw the Princess.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Get up.

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Lan Ling's hand painting is a bit too much.

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll take it.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll take it.

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll take it.

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Come on.

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Lan Ling's hand painting is very powerful.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Very good.

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I like it.

384
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But I don't know how much center

385
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is under the power of power.

386
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You don't have to ask about the center of Chongzhao.

387
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You just need to see.

388
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Chongzhao, you can't let go of me.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's okay.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want the power.

391
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If she can't, it's useless to talk about it.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Fu Ling, in January,

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Chongzhao was defeated.

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You did very well.

395
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I thought Lan Ling's hand painting could last for long.

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It seems like it's a soft bone.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Chen Ye, Chongzhao

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
will be our next guest in the Cold Spring Palace.

399
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're welcome.

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He is Chen Ye.

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I just lost my word.

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I should call you Chongzhao's late king

403
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
or demon king.

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm the one who came to the Cold Spring Palace.

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course, it's Chongzhao's demon king.

406
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If you have something to say,

407
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
don't talk nonsense here.

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Master, the detective reported that

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Fan Yue was in the Jin Yong Mountain with Bai Shuo.

410
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But he didn't tell us anything about the battle between Changmei and them.

411
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, if I remember correctly,

412
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Chongzhao, you and Bai Shuo must be old friends.

413
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
If I send you to the Jin Yong Mountain,

414
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you should bring back Bai Shuo.

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Master's purpose is not Fan Yue, but Bai Shuo.

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Fan Yue is protecting her just for the sake of the missing.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If I can get her in my hands,

418
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
can I still have her?

419
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Chongzhao,

420
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
don't you want me to see your heart?

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then I'll wait and see.

422
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Chongzhao, lead the way.

423
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think he must have seen the picture of the Yushi of the Five-Year-Tian.

424
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Could it be that a new year will come?

425
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The Yushi can't be taken away.

426
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The Yushi of the Five-Year-Tian is not back.

427
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It must be in danger when looking for the Yushi.

428
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Tian Hu, I've asked the chief of the station.

429
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You should watch over her.

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't worry.

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I won't let anything happen to you.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you kidding me?

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You asked me to come here.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You also asked me to come here.

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I'm the one who's in the back yard of your Haoyue Hall.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're kidding me.

437
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The chief of the station is indeed in the Jin Yong Mountain.

438
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you don't know,

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll go there myself.

440
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Forget it.

441
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You're not familiar with many places in Jin Yong Mountain.

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll take you there.

443
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thank you.

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thank you.

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
As for the water,

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I have a question.

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Since you've agreed to take the responsibility,

448
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
why are you waiting for two days?

449
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But there are only two days left.

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What's the point of waiting for you?

451
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Even if it's a treasure,

452
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
it can't be taken out easily.

453
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
If you take away the treasure,

454
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Mu Jiu will follow Tian Hu and run away.

455
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Where will you let me catch him?

456
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,880
Mu Jiu's intention is not to

457
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
make the chief of the Hu Clan take the position.

458
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
Even if he takes the position,

459
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
he will still run away.

460
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I really want to know

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
how confident you are.

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
After two days,

463
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
can you let Mu Jiu run away?

464
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Chief,

465
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
bad news.

466
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If you have any questions,

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll go to find someone.

468
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Chief,

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'll take the new born right-wing

470
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to accept the Qin Shu's mansion.

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But that's a strong and hard-working plan.

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Some of the people are wrong.

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm in the discussion.

474
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Chang Sheng has gone to deal with it.

475
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But I'm afraid we can't keep it from him.

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I know.

477
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And

478
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the Cang Shan by Fan Yue

479
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
disappeared.

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's also Qin Shu's fault.

481
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll go and see it myself.

482
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You take care of Fan Yue.

483
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Don't let him find out about you.

484
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes.

485
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I was wrong.

486
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I shouldn't have married you.

487
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But I've thought about every word you said.

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I like you.

489
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm not just talking.

490
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

491
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll tell him later.

492
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What are you doing?

493
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I... I heard Miss Bai is sick.

494
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know what's wrong.

495
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't know what to eat.

496
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll get everything I can find.

497
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Look.

498
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm leaving.

499
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Stop.

500
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll go first.

501
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Stop.

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I heard from the owner about the throne.

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You and the master are going to bet.

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You're going to get married with me in three days.

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
In order to avoid the throne,

506
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
you're going to bet with me.

507
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Mu Jiu, you're capable.

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No, no.

509
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Ah Hu, listen to me.

510
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The throne is not your business.

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's aunt's business.

512
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You're a kid who hasn't grown up.

513
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're going to bet on anything.

514
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Isn't it because you're going to let me

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
fall in love with you?

516
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's only been two days.

517
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You want to bet?

518
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I know

519
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
you've been with your parents.

520
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You don't want to love them.

521
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I know

522
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
when you're strong,

523
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
you'll feel lonely.

524
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm not capable.

525
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I can't beat you.

526
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm not as good as Fan Yue.

527
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And

528
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I like to say

529
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
things that don't matter to you.

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But when I think about it,

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm not willing

532
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
to be sad with you.

533
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Ah Hu,

534
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I really want to be with you.

535
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I want to be with you forever.

536
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When we're old,

537
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
we'll be white.

538
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You look back

539
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and see that I'm still here.

540
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Can you believe

541
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
that I like you?

542
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I said so many things.

544
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I won't bother you.

545
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm leaving.

546
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You said it.

547
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Maybe it's true.

548
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Of course.

549
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll help you this time.

550
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'll marry you in two days.

551
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's a fake marriage.

552
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But after the marriage,

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you'll leave Hu Zu.

554
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Live your life

555
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
as you want.

556
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
When you can

557
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
stop your life,

558
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
we'll talk about it slowly.

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What?

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You mean

561
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you're willing to give me a chance?

562
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Right?

563
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So what?

564
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Ah Hu, don't worry.

565
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
As long as I'm alive,

566
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
even if I die,

567
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll always like you.

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I said it.

569
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The ability to control the night

570
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
is getting stronger.

571
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Master,

572
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
is that the Huangshan Grass Plant?

573
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No way.

574
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's...

575
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Maybe it's a mess

576
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
in the back of the tribe.

577
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't worry, master.

578
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's not that special.

579
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The Demon Lord of the Mountain

580
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
will never come here.

581
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Who's there?

582
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Mountain.

583
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Mountain.

584
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Mountain.

585
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Master.

586
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Master.

587
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Be careful.

588
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Sit down and talk.

589
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What happened yesterday?

590
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I...

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I followed the order

592
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
of the master yesterday.

593
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I searched for

594
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the hidden place

595
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
where the Ruo Shui Stone could be.

596
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But the tribe was too big.

597
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
There was no place to hide.

598
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I searched for it and found it in the night.

599
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I wanted to return to the hotel first.

600
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But at this time,

601
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I was found by the Ruo Shui Stone.

602
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The Ruo Shui Stone?

603
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
How do you know

604
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
what Ruo Shui Stone looks like?

605
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right.

606
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I clearly don't know

607
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
what he looks like.

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Why do I feel like

609
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I found it?

610
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Did he get some kind of spell

611
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and cause a hallucination?

612
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's possible.

613
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And then?

614
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
How did you get lost?

615
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I can't remember.

616
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I only remember that

617
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I saw a big tree.

618
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Then,

619
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I saw a black thing.

620
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just don't remember anything.

621
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The people who went to the Huo tribe said

622
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
this is the talisman of the forest.

623
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But the Shui Tribe of the Mountain

624
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
is very strong and strong.

625
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's impossible to find the talisman.

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Could it be the hand of Chang Mei?

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Why would Chang Mei

628
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
want to harm the Mountain?

629
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Even if she doesn't want

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to give us the Ruo Shui Stone,

631
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
it's not necessary

632
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
to hurt the person on purpose.

633
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Today, in the Monster Forest,

634
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I saw the color of the talisman.

635
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I felt that there was someone

636
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
who deliberately moved the mountain

637
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to the place where the Shui Tribe moved.

638
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If I didn't guess it correctly,

639
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the truth of the mountain

640
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
is the secret of the Mountain.

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's that tree.

642
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Why are you here?

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
How is it?

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm fine.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The mountain is injured.

646
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll heal it first.

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Here.

648
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'll do it.

649
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Here.

650
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I saw the picture of the Wunian Stone

651
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
in the Shui Tribe.

652
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's a mess this time.

653
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I see.

654
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What did you see?

655
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
A big tree

656
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is in Mount Jin You.

657
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There's a strange thing around.

658
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes, yes.

659
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
He said

660
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I saw that tree.

661
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Not only that,

662
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I also saw the tree you walked towards.

663
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The tree was so sharp,

664
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
it opened a gap,

665
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and pushed you in.

666
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Fan Yuan,

667
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
there must be something

668
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in the mountain.

669
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There are so many trees in Mount Jin You.

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
How can I find them?

671
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Master,

672
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that's the wilderness.

673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
There's no way out.

674
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm sure you know.

675
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Canshan,

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
send Bai Shu back to Ning'an.

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll be back when the fire is over.

678
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm not leaving.

679
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The picture of the Wunian Stone is already out.

680
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How can I miss it?

681
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's not important.

682
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

683
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I can't remember

684
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
how your seven stars are going to be.

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I have my own way.

686
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Canshan,

687
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
send her away.

688
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I saw it myself.

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You'll be in danger in Mount Jin You.

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You let me leave

691
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
in this sight.

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What are you thinking?

693
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Master,

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
he's already asked

695
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
for this.

696
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Tell him.

697
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You're a human being.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The more you think about it,

699
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
the more you can't bear it.

700
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You were in a daze last night.

701
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That's why you're bleeding.

702
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's why you're bleeding.

703
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The reason for the seven stars is

704
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that I'm not in the right place.

705
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I only know

706
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
if you continue to think about it,

707
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you'll die that day.

708
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Bai Shu,

709
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't want you to die.

710
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I won't let you die.

711
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's all for me.

712
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Leave here.

713
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Master,

714
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Qing Shu is suffering from a stroke.

715
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
She's injured.

716
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
She's got a consciousness.

717
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
When are you going to

718
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
solve this problem?

719
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What are you worried about?

720
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Even if you force me to die,

721
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll have to wait for my own end.

722
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Master, don't be angry.

723
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Elder Chang Cheng isn't a criminal.

724
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He's just a fool.

725
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Shut up!

726
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If you didn't stop him,

727
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Qing Shu wouldn't have

728
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
come to this level.

729
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm sorry.

730
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm sorry.

731
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
If you keep being a criminal,

732
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Qing Shu wouldn't have come to this level.

733
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Eight hundred years ago,

734
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
when Ruo Shui Shi lost,

735
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Qing Shu lost her own self-esteem.

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The whole family was blinded by the idea.

737
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
If I hadn't been the Elder,

738
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I wouldn't have known the truth.

739
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Do you still remember

740
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
the truth about Gan Wen Mountain?

741
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
After I had known the truth,

742
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you promised me.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I said that

744
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
even if Ruo Shui Shi is gone,

745
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Qing Shu would never

746
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
stop me

747
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
from being the leader of this generation.

748
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Good standing and good deeds.

749
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
If I were you,

750
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I wouldn't have drawn any attention to him.

751
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
If I could find the opportunity

752
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and put my hands first,

753
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
then I'd wonputer all the High Shards.

754
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What be the high隨處?

755
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Little Tang Xia,

756
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
you need the Eight Sacras to be in position.

757
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
At that just in case,

758
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,700
you could just tell where my sister And then they 어떻게

759
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,100
came to this separation dinner?

760
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,700
Let's not fight each other.

761
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Why are you here?

762
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm worried about you.

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So I asked Master to let me come to protect you.

764
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,500
It's a matter of monitoring.

765
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,000
You're afraid that I'll be exposed to the so-called leak

766
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
in the Cold Palace.

767
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That's why you followed me.

768
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What do you think?

769
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If you didn't bring back the white beast,

770
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Master wouldn't let you go.

771
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm doing something you can't do.

772
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You should thank me.

773
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't need you to mind the matter.

774
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I have my own way.

775
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What way?

776
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's better to tell him that I'm not a thief.

777
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm not a thief.

778
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm just a thief.

779
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What way?

780
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Tell him that you're a friend of the old days.

781
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You're the one who saved him.

782
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You're not allowed to be against the white beast.

783
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Chongzhao,

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
you're already a person in the Cold Palace.

785
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Your hands are really dirty.

786
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You can't wash them clean.

787
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You're a murderer to the white beast.

788
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Do you think

789
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
he'll still remember the pitiful love?

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Our target this time is the white beast.

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We must secretly act in the lake.

792
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
If Changmei finds out,

793
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we'll be in trouble.

794
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And,

795
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
don't blame me for not reminding you.

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
In the Jinyou Mountain,

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
you and the white beast are late.

798
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If you still have the heart to die,

799
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
your death will be the only thing left.

800
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Stay, don't stay.

801
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Stay, don't stay.

802
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
White beast,

803
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
how are we going to leave?

804
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't say that.

805
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The thing in the lake is quite tasty.

806
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Try it.

807
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Just two.

808
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Finish it.

809
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Let's go.

810
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Don't say that.

811
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's quite tasty.

812
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't worry.

813
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is just a pill

814
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that you can't take for granted.

815
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Is it?

816
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I thought

817
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Fan Yue came to Ruoshui Mountain

818
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
to get her soul mate.

819
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But she came here because of me.

820
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll die if I keep missing her.

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But if I don't, she'll die.

822
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll have to kill every single one of them.

823
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
She wants me to live.

824
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I should make her live, too.

825
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
When you're in a hurry to miss her,

826
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you might never find

827
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the one you missed.

828
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I can see

829
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
her temperament.

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What she said

831
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
is true.

832
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
She's always thinking about

833
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
not letting her be betrayed.

834
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
She's also thinking about

835
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
sending me back

836
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
because of you.

837
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But who wants it for her?

838
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So,

839
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I can't leave.

840
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I have to protect her.

841
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Just like she's protecting us.

842
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Am I right?

843
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Uncle.

844
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Uncle.

845
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Uncle.

846
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Chongzhao?

847
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Yes.

848
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Is it beautiful?

849
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll marry you

850
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and have a wedding

851
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
with the most handsome couple.

852
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Nonsense.

853
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I won't marry you.

854
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Really?

855
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yes.

856
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I don't care.

857
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll marry you.

858
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Wait.

859
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'll come with you

860
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
tomorrow.

861
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Brother.

862
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Brother.

863
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I finally agreed to marry you.

864
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm here to get married.

865
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I've thought about it.

866
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
A Huo

867
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
is not easy to believe

868
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
his parents' relationship.

869
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I must seize this opportunity

870
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and let him feel my sincerity.

871
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You're the most important person in my life.

872
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You have to help me

873
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
to hold a grand wedding

874
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
for him.

875
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Then,

876
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll make a vow

877
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
in front of the whole family.

878
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll ruin his life.

879
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You bastard.

880
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's not easy to hold a grand wedding.

881
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
At least, you have to make a promise.

882
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
How about this?

883
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You'll attend the ceremony

884
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
of the late Princess Ji first.

885
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then...

886
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Why the late Princess Ji?

887
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm a married man.

888
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll be with A Huo

889
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
in the future.

890
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We agreed.

891
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
As long as A Huo

892
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
agrees to marry me,

893
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll be free.

894
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I remember it's nearby.

895
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The traces of the forest

896
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
are gone for half a year.

897
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It must be the Huo people

898
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
who have covered it.

899
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We'll take action separately

900
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and find a cure for you.

901
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm afraid we'll be late.

902
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You escaped from the Cold Spring Palace.

903
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Why didn't you

904
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
come back safely?

905
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Have you forgotten

906
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
what happened in the doctor's room?

907
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Fan Yue.

908
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Chong Zhao.

909
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Choose one.

910
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I can let go

911
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
the one you chose.

912
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Fan Yue.

913
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I choose Fan Yue.

914
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I chose her.

915
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's because she has the most chance to...

916
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's because she's strong.

917
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's because I'm not like her.

918
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So you made that choice.

919
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I know you're not like her.

921
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm sorry.

923
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm sorry.

924
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I was too careless.

925
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I was wrong.

926
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I was wrong.

927
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I was wrong.

928
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm sorry.

929
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm sorry.

930
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm sorry.

931
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I...

932
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm sorry.

933
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm sorry.

934
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What's going on?

935
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm fine.

936
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm fine.

937
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Don't worry about it.

938
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm fine.

939
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Enough of that.

940
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You will be alright.

941
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,200
You've been through a lot.

942
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,720
You've been trying to get rid of him, right?

943
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,000
And,

944
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,000
why are you here in the lake?

945
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,600
How do you know I'm here?

946
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,640
What are you doing?

947
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,240
Uncle Bai,

948
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,120
I told you to go back.

949
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,960
But you're here with him.

950
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,240
Uncle Bai,

951
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,080
you're so nice.

952
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,440
I...

953
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,520
What does he want to do?

954
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,880
What does it have to do with you?

955
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,040
I have nothing to do with him.

956
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,400
We grew up together.

957
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,240
We were born and raised together.

958
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,800
He's my business.

959
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,120
You're right.

960
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,720
Born and raised together.

961
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,320
You're a useless person.

962
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,600
You're not qualified to be born and raised.

963
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,720
I think you should go back to Laning

964
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,680
and practice for a few more years.

965
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,480
Fan Yue!

966
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,560
Don't put him on the line.

967
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,160
Since you met in the lake,

968
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,520
you can go back with me.

969
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:24,920
No!

970
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,640
No need.

971
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
I have other things to do.

972
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,200
Uncle Bai,

973
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,280
I'll come back to you.

974
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,720
Off to me!

975
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,240
Song Ye

976
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,260
Phung Zhang!

977
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,100
What are you doing?

978
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,680
It should not be me.

979
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,180
Don't you think he should explain it to me?

980
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,760
Born and raised together.

981
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,740
You're a useless person.

982
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,020
You're not qualified to be born and raised together.

983
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,120
I think you should go back to Laning and practice with your friends.

984
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,120
It's a pity that I came to find him.

985
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,120
I was like a dog in the family.

986
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,120
It's a pity that Li Le's dog is like a wild dog.

987
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Even if he dies on the road, no one will look at him.

988
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
It's true that you asked me to come to Jingyou Mountain.

989
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
It's not that I...

990
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Master asked you to catch the white snake.

991
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Did you do anything?

992
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
It's not the right time yet.

993
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,120
The right time is not waiting.

994
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Tonight, I'll go to the moon.

995
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
You take the white snake and take it away.

996
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
No!

997
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,120
There are also the fire and the mountain around the moon.

998
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,120
It's dangerous for you to go alone.

999
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,120
What do you think?

1000
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,120
I think the moon is in the shape of a green forest.

1001
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,120
I think the person from the moon will come to Jingyou Mountain.

1002
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,120
There must be some purpose.

1003
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,120
If we can get away from the two sides,

1004
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
we can let Changmei go to the moon.

1005
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,120
We can only take the white snake back.

1006
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Maybe we can get away from the moon for the Cold Palace.

1007
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,120
The Immortal Army is the Immortal Army.

1008
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,120
It's hard to believe that I'm not as good as this demon.

1009
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,120
It's just that if we want to kill the Moon,

1010
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
it's for the Cold Palace

1011
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,120
or the Immortal Army's selfishness?

1012
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
The Immortal Army

1013
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,120
The Immortal Army

1014
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,120
The Immortal Army

1015
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
The Immortal Army

1016
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,120
The Immortal Army

1017
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,120
The Immortal Army

1018
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
The Immortal Army

1019
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
The Immortal Army

1020
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
The Immortal Army

1021
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,120
The Immortal Army

1022
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,120
The Immortal Army

1023
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
The Immortal Army

1024
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
The Immortal Army

1025
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
The Immortal Army

1026
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:12,120
You're the only one who's been coming to me.

1027
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:20,120
My heart is so excited.

1028
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Wait for me.

1029
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1030
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1031
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1032
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:48,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1033
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:55,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1034
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:02,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1035
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:10,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1036
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:18,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1037
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:26,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.

1038
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,120
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your voice.
