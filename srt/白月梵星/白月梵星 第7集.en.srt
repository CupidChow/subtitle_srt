truly cared for me?

No.

You're very smart.

72

If you don't want to learn,

94
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,650

you've called me Master,

today,

112
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,460
we should

113
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,690
set a rule.

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,540
What rule?

115
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,420
Just tell me.

116
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,190
To become my disciple,

117
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,630
you need to pay first.

118
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,250
It's not what I want either.

119
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,350
I'm just staying here temporarily in Lanling,

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,640
and I have to pay for accommodation every month.

121
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,550
Otherwise, they would've kicked me out long ago.

122
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,400
They are so stingy.

123
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,650
Why are you still staying here?

124
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you think I want

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,800
to be exploited by those old fossils?

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,040
I've been making elixirs every day,

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,680
and it...

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,830
and it has made my turtle shell almost crack.

129
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,250
But I'm the only 1000-year-old spirit turtle

130
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,210
in the whole Eastern Continent.

131
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,280
Everyone knows I'm skilled in divination,

132
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,960
and everyone wants to capture me to predict the future for them.

133
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,790
In this vast world,

134
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,080
only Lanling

135
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,750
can protect

136
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,450
my turtle body!

137
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,310
It's it.

138
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,490
There are four steps:

139
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,990
look, smell, touch, and taste.

140
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,630
These are the ways to identify medicinal herbs.

141
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,320
My disciple, as the saying goes,

142
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,560
make the most of what's around you.

143
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,000
Since you've come to this mountain,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
you should learn to make use of what others consider useless.

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,870
What's the effect of the old tree bark?

146
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,800
It clears heat and disperses blood stasis.

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,730
Smart!

148
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,670
Let's go.

149
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,750
How do you make it?

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,800
Turn up the heat.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,070
Don't underestimate this alchemy furnace.

152
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,120
It's older than me.

153
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,180
It was forged from meteoric iron that fell from the sky.

154
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,159
Have you understood?

155
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
Good.

156
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,140
Wait.

157
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,650
Can you understand it?

158
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,850
I can.

159
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
What does the letter say?

160
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,260
They also refused to come.

161
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,310
Among the 72 Sects,

162
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,160
except for Kunlun Sect and the Wuliang Sect,

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,680
none are willing to start a war.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Then how can we conquer the Cold Spring Palace?

165
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,960
Be gentle.

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,830
This table was just repaired.

167
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,420
I know.

168
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,780
I held back my strength.

169
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,680
The 72 Sects

170
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
each have their own philosophy.

171
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,440
Some seek worldly engagement,

172
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,929
some are reclusive;

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,070
[When the Lanling Sect and others discuss the matter of the conquest, our sect will definitely spare no effort]

174
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,070
[Our sect fully agrees and is willing to work together to discuss the strategy for the conquest]

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,490
some value culture, some value martial arts;

176
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,630
some are radical, some are conservative.

177
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,820
The different philosophies lead to disagreements.

178
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,040
Since the truce between the Eternals Race and the Demon Race 100 years ago,

179
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,390
the Human Race has been living in peace.

180
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,180
It's understandable that the Eternals

181
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,730
don't want to break this peace.

182
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,870
Sect Leader, since you know this,

183
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,380
why did you send letters to them?

184
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,860
I thought that

185
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,770
even if some sects don't like war,

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,310
among the 72 sects,

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,750
there would still be at least

188
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,060
30% supporting it.

189
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,890
But I didn't expect that

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,780
I couldn't find even three sects.

191
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,670
As you all know,

192
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,360
these sects are spread across the Eastern Continent.

193
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,960
It was...

194
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,190
It was exhausting.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
But that's not the main problem.

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,550
The real problem is that

197
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,870
we spent a lot of money

198
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,300
from the treasury to send the letters this time.

199
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,430
It's becoming increasingly empty.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,860
You should stop using the term "treasury."

201
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,300
Otherwise,

202
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,990
people will think we're rich.

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,150
Well, why don't you start some new business?

204
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,980
Back then,

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,520
when Chong Zhao was running that steamed bun stall,

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,090
he made quite a lot of money.

207
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,070
Yes.

208
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,130
Speaking of Chong Zhao,

209
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,450
he's already been punished

210
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,870
and has completed his self-reflection.

211
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,630
I think it's time to let him back.

212
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,720
Although he can no longer serve as an Eternal Envoy,

213
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,930
he is, after all,

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,850
the head disciple of Lanling Sect.

215
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,710
We can't just let him stay on that mountain forever.

216
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,950
Master Turtle!

217
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,850
Master Turtle!

218
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,030
Master Turtle!

219
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,790
Master Turtle, are you there?

220
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll be out in a minute! Wait for me in the yard!

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,030
Hurry up and find a place to hide.

222
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,270
Coming!

223
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Master Turtle!

224
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,360
Master Turtle!

225
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,480
Coming!

226
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,270
I'm here.

227
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,360
-Thank you, Master Turtle.
-Thank you, Master Turtle.

228
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,670
There's no need.

229
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,930
What's going on lately?

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,510
Why do you suddenly need such a large amount of elixirs?

231
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,390
Well,

232
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,960
it's because of Chong Zhao.

233
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,910
They all say that Chong Zhao

234
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,220
is a once-in-a-century genius in Lanling

235
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,520
with limitless potential.

236
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,470
But now he has been given 300 lashes

237
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,960
and sent to Heart-guarding Cliff.

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,470
However, with him gone,

239
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,850
the position of the Eternal Envoy in Ning'an City is now vacant.

240
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,540
The Sect Leader said there will be a martial arts competition,

241
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,350
and the winner

242
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,310
will become the new Eternal Envoy.

243
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,390
We expend spiritual power during training,

244
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,720
so we came to ask you

245
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,150
for some elixirs to replenish it.

246
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,030
Chong Zhao

247
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,680
is the Sect Leader's direct disciple.

248
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
How did he end up like this?

249
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,750
Well,

250
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,960
he brought it upon himself.

251
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,460
If he had had no other choices,

252
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,630
it would have been acceptable.

253
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,090
But to save someone, he delayed reporting

254
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,930
the news of the Demon Race harming the Human Race

255
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,360
by a day.

256
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,020
Otherwise,

257
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,970
the Demon Race wouldn't have had the chance

258
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,270
to wreak havoc in Ning'an City.

259
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,560
I heard that the person

260
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,240
is the daughter of the governor of Ning'an City.

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,690
Do you think Chong Zhao

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,150
has fallen in love?

263
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,760
He actually made such a huge mistake for a woman.

264
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,670
Alright.

265
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,360
The high-up Eternals are waiting.

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's take the elixirs back first.

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Master Turtle.

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,510
-We're leaving.
-See you.

269
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,510
Go ahead.

270
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,480
What did they mean by 300 lashes?

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,610
And what is the Heart-guarding Cliff?

272
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,820
Master.

273
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,420
Have you learned anything these days?

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,650
Of all the hardships in the world, guarding the heart is the hardest.

275
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,610
Master,

276
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,510
my resolve

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,600
seems to be wavering.

278
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,910
The Eternals are also made of flesh and blood.

279
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,600
On this long journey,

280
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,790
confusion and doubt

281
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,710
are natural things.

282
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,730
The true self-cultivation

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,430
is not in the mountains,

284
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,300
but in the bustling world.

285
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,630
Go down the mountain.

286
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,320
Experience what you must experience,

287
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,680
and bear what you must bear.

288
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,170
Right and wrong,

289
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,860
good and evil, cause and effectâ€”

290
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
in the end,

291
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,560
you will find the answer.

292
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,570
Master.

293
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,510
Do you still think there is

294
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,070
nothing suspicious about my parents' death?

295
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,640
After your parents' incident,

296
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,170
the entire Lanling Sect was mobilized

297
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,100
and investigated for a whole year,

298
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,390
but in the end, the result was the same.

299
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,790
Chong Zhao,

300
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,320
some things should be let go

301
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,740
when it's time.

302
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,440
Otherwise,

303
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,320
you'll suffer.

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,180
Recently, Cold Spring Palace has been very active.

305
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,790
Within three months, they've wiped out three clans.

306
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,000
Zhen Yu has taken the internal elixirs of the three chiefs

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,860
to heal the wound from his severed tail.

308
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,550
Being so impatient,

309
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,210
he must be planning to stir up trouble again.

310
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,520
With me here,

311
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,230
Zhen Yu won't stir up any big trouble.

312
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,850
What's the situation at Jingyou Mountain?

313
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,590
The Jingyou Fox Clan has always stayed out of external conflicts.

314
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,100
They didn't make any moves.

315
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,840
The top priority now

316
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,370
is still to help Bai Shuo gather the Five Contemplations.

317
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,330
As for everything else, we can just watch from the sidelines.

318
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,220
Master, I've been wanting to ask you a question.

319
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,280
You compromised with Bai Shuo so many times.

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,610
Is it really just because of the Desireless Stone?

321
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,540
Master, I'm boldly reminding you.

322
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,810
Don't let Bai Shuo become your weakness.

323
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,330
Since the day I became the Demon King,

324
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,200
I've had no weaknesses.

325
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,510
Aren't you afraid of the Master punishing you?

326
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,600
Whether you're an Eternal or a Demon,

327
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,910
no matter how strong your sorcery is,

328
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,640
once you fall in love,

329
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,760
you'll have a weakness that can be exploited.

330
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,710
Don't worry.

331
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,790
Our Master

332
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
will never fall in love.

333
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,350
No matter what,

334
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,230
if Bai Shuo causes any trouble in the future,

335
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,900
even if it means risking the Master's punishment,

336
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,730
I'll clear the obstacle.

337
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,080
Are you still

338
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,630
thinking about Chong Zhao?

339
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Don't drink too much.

340
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,570
The peach blossom wine is rare.

341
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,170
I've only kept a few bottles.

342
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Alright, alright.

343
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,480
Keep going.

344
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,790
You're my disciple after all.

345
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,990
You can drink as much as my wine you want.

346
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,670
Where is

347
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,920
Heart-guarding Cliff?

348
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,820
The Desireless Stone is still inside you.

349
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,390
You can't run around.

350
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,750
And Chong Zhao delayed reporting the demon situation because of you.

351
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,630
If something happens to you in the Eternal Race,

352
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,580
and he ends up clashing with the sect for you,

353
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,770
what should we do?

354
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,000
Because of me?

355
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,570
For me,

356
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,300
he almost got an entire city killed.

357
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,300
If it hadn't been for the Five Eternals of Lanling arriving in time,

358
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,160
and if my father hadn't sacrificed his life to exchange for Kindness,

359
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,510
the whole city would have been destroyed.

360
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,840
I honestly wish he had never done it for me.

361
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,930
If the Five Eternals had arrived earlier,

362
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,200
maybe the city wouldn't have fallen into chaos,

363
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,390
and maybe my father wouldn't have...

364
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,560
But what right do I have to blame him?

365
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,500
After all,

366
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,200
everything that happened in Ning'an City

367
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,680
was because of me.

368
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,460
Girl,

369
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,270
there are many things in this world

370
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,980
that can't be judged right or wrong.

371
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,700
No one can foresee everything in the world.

372
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,670
Most of the time,

373
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,300
we just

374
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,050
follow our hearts.

375
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
The past cannot be changed.

376
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,680
We must look forward.

377
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,160
Yeah.

378
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,280
I can't go back to the past.

379
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,870
To the bright moon,

380
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,290
to the night sky,

381
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,920
to this miserable life,

382
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,520
â™«Don't linger, don't regretâ™«

383
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,130
and to the past that I can't go back to.

384
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,610
Cheers!

385
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,910
â™«The last moonlightâ™«

386
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,240
You're still young!

387
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,520
Why did you say that your life is miserable?

388
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,090
Do you even know what life is?

389
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,560
â™«The water from my hometown flows gentlyâ™«

390
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,680
Then tell me,

391
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,360
â™«Sending me to the distant placeâ™«

392
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,910
what is life?

393
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,060
â™«In this life, at this timeâ™«

394
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,890
I can't tell you

395
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,560
what life is.

396
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,870
â™«I dare not look backâ™«

397
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,380
But...

398
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,369
if I must say,

399
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,869
â™«Is there the same moonlightâ™«

400
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,180
life

401
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,050
is the process of going from having nothing

402
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,099
â™«on your path?â™«

403
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,440
to having nothing again.

404
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,400
The beginning and the end are already set.

405
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,970
â™«I'm walking on a never-ending long roadâ™«

406
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,230
But the experiences in between

407
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,640
â™«In the vast world, how can I go there?â™«

408
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,140
are up to you to decide.

409
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,740
With my thousand years of age,

410
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,480
â™«The night wind is chaotic, and the sound of the Qin is brokenâ™«

411
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,210
I can tell you four things not to do:

412
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,960
â™«The moonlight is gentleâ™«

413
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,200
â™«All the attachments left are just a dreamâ™«

414
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,980
don't be obsessed,

415
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,359
don't torment yourself,

416
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,790
don't force things,

417
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,330
â™«I listen to the past, never enoughâ™«

418
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,270
and don't be pretentious.

419
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,840
Live

420
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,760
â™«I sing until I have no voice, only wandering remainsâ™«

421
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,410
your life well.

422
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,300
Understood?

423
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,770
â™«I forget the past, don't care anymoreâ™«

424
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,340
Girl,

425
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,830
â™«After many cyclesâ™«

426
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,510
I don't know

427
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,220
â™«I ended up with desolationâ™«

428
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,260
how much you've really taken in.

429
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,410
Fine.

430
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,800
Everyone

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,700
has to walk their own path.

432
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
Whether it's good or bad,

433
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,320
only by experiencing it yourself

434
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,590
will you truly understand.

435
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,410
[On the 22nd of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I went to the Western Mountain.]

436
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,270
[On the 18th of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I patrolled a remote area in the southern part of the city at night.]

437
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,260
[On the 11th of April, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I patrolled the city.]

438
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,540
On the 7th of May, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

439
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,070
my husband Chong Tai and I were patrolling the southeast.

440
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,640
We saw a village in the distance,

441
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
with paths crisscrossing

442
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,460
and people coming and going.

443
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,920
[Chong Tai, Eternal, Lanling Sect]
[Meng Ning, Eternal, Lanling Sect]

444
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,920
-Look.
-We wanted to enter the village to investigate,

445
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,570
but when we stepped forward, the scene and the people suddenly vanished.

446
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,590
Could this be the mirage in the legend?

447
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,090
That's weird.

448
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,910
Yes.

449
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,240
On the 14th of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

450
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,420
my husband Chong Tai and I were passing through Qingyao Mountain

451
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,020
when we saw a snake demon kill more than 10 people.

452
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,300
So we tried to kill the demon,

453
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,060
but she was pregnant.

454
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,020
In the end, we let the baby snakes return to the forests.

455
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,820
I don't know whether what we did was right or wrong.

456
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,970
All the Eternals know that your parents were killed

457
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,100
by a scorpion demon 10 years ago.

458
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,210
But do you know

459
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,110
that two days before your parents were killed,

460
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,310
Qian Yin had already died?

461
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,880
You've been investigating for years but have found nothing.

462
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,230
Do you know why?

463
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,800
Because

464
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,490
you've never set foot in the Demon Race.

465
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,810
What you see now

466
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,390
may not be the truth.

467
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,630
And in places you can't see,

468
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,130
the truth

469
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,640
might be right there.

470
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,100
On the 15th of July, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

471
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,740
the Eternals and demons fought a great battle,

472
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,800
and we lost more than half of our forces.

473
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,850
While we were cleaning up the bodies of the Eternals,

474
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,300
two of them showed no signs of demon injuries.

475
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,200
Since they weren't killed by demons,

476
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,050
how did they die?

477
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
Did my parents uncover something

478
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,270
that led to their deaths?

479
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,000
It seems

480
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,870
I really need to visit the Demon Race.

481
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,020
You came after all.

482
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,200
Why do you always want to get physical every time you see me?

483
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,330
I do miss the you

484
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
who saved me in Ning'an City.

485
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,060
Don't even mention Ning'an City!

486
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,050
Just the fact that you used the Nether Poison to harm the Human Race

487
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,080
is enough for me to execute you right now!

488
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,140
Is that so?

489
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,710
So today, are you here in the Cold Spring Palace's territory

490
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,190
to kill me

491
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,870
or to beg me?

492
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,630
Take me to see Qian Yin's grave.

493
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,580
How dare you show disrespect to my guest?

494
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,510
Sorry for startling you.

495
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,300
Just like humans,

496
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,490
demons who die

497
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,330
would be buried by their family members,

498
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,220
and monuments would be erected

499
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,350
in their memory.

500
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,210
That

501
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,650
is Qian Yin's grave.

502
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
He died on the 15th of July, 10 years ago,

503
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,690
and your parents

504
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,180
died on the 17th of July.

505
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,280
You expect me to believe you with just a tombstone inscription?

506
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
You've come here with me.

507
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,560
You still won't admit that you believe me?

508
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,920
10 years of Fortunei

509
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,370
and seven years of wintergreen

510
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,790
can be used to make a fourth-grade elixir,

511
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,460
which can gather spiritual energy.

512
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,810
Twenty years of withered Poria

513
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,350
and thirty years of perilla leaves

514
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,800
can be used to make a third-grade elixir,

515
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,900
which can expand spiritual veins.

516
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,160
A hundred years of refined ice and a thousand years of Snow Lotus

517
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,300
can be used to make a second-grade elixir,

518
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,630
which can refine spiritual foundations.

519
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Master,

520
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,940
why is there no record of first-grade elixirs?

521
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,960
First-grade elixirs?

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,270
That's a legend from ancient times.

523
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,000
No one has ever seen one.

524
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,070
Tell me more about it.

525
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,520
Maybe I can make it.

526
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,440
I'm not underestimating you.

527
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,510
A first-grade elixir can even

528
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,630
withstand the thunder tribulation of a high-up Eternal ascending.

529
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,860
It's not an ordinary thing.

530
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,200
I've never made one myself.

531
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,470
You?

532
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,160
Forget it.

533
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,690
If I really manage to make it,

534
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,760
what will my reward be?

535
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,840
You can't make it.

536
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,930
Tell me what the reward will be first.

537
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,140
How about you tell me what reward you want first?

538
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000
If I make it,

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,330
lend me your turtle shell.

540
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,010
The shell of a 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle

541
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,130
can make divination more accurate.

542
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,180
You want my shell?

543
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,360
Don't even think about it.

544
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,510
You're not after my shell,

545
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,590
you're after my life.

546
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,490
If a turtle loses its shell,

547
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,350
it can be easily killed by anyone.

548
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Then where did this shell

549
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,510
come from?

550
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,460
It's the shell of a dead turtle.

551
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,410
You gave me someone's remains?

552
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,980
What's so strange about it?

553
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,180
After I die,

554
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,140
my remains

555
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,820
will be yours too.

556
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,240
How long will that take?

557
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,920
You're really wishing for my death, aren't you?

558
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,640
Of course not.

559
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,420
I just think that a turtle like you

560
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,790
might live longer than I will.

561
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,650
I can't count on

562
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
your remains.

563
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,420
Good that you know.

564
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,760
Where are you going?

565
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,090
Going back to sleep.

566
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,670
So you little troublemaker

567
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,770
won't try to get my shell

568
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,130
while I'm asleep.

569
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,750
Now that Old Turtle has left,

570
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,030
the long night

571
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,420
does seem a bit boring.

572
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
It's so late now.

573
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,690
I wonder if that Demon King is asleep yet.

574
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,330
Fan Yue?

575
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,410
He really is asleep.

576
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,330
What?

577
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,570
Nothing.

578
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,380
I'm staying up late

579
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,490
making elixirs.

580
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,060
So?

581
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
So?

582
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,200
Don't ask me like it's none of your business.

583
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,130
It was supposed to be you teaching me.

584
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,850
But you sent me to Old Turtle

585
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,450
and now you're just sitting back,

586
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,610
enjoying your free time.

587
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,870
Enjoying my free time?

588
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,800
What else would you be doing?

589
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,860
What are you doing?

590
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,760
Are you busy

591
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,790
fighting over territory with the Cold Spring Palace?

592
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,990
Fan Yue.

593
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm listening.

594
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,380
Let me tell you,

595
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,430
my alchemy skills are pretty good now.

596
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,560
If I make a first-grade elixir,

597
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,830
even Old Turtle will have to call me Master.

598
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,690
It's said that first-grade elixirs are very powerful.

599
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,990
Once I make one and take it,

600
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,840
both Eternals and demons will be afraid of me.

601
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
So will you.

602
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,630
Really?

603
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,530
Just you wait.

604
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,630
â™«We're destined to be together forever from the first sightâ™«

605
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
I also learned some divination techniques from Old Turtle.

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,730
But I'm not used to

607
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,370
â™«Goodbye, lonelinessâ™«

608
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,280
this turtle shell,

609
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,920
â™«The one who was slightly lateâ™«

610
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,780
so I haven't been able to get any predictions.

611
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,820
Do you think he's deceiving me?

612
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,440
Deceiving you?

613
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,530
â™«You came towards me, closer and closerâ™«

614
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,620
He's a 1000-year-old turtle.

615
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,820
He's really cunning.

616
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,800
There's a moon here,

617
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,660
a crescent moon.

618
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:34,150
â™«You enriched my lifeâ™«

619
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,010
Is there one over there?

620
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,640
So, both the Eternals and demons

621
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,460
are looking at the same moon.

622
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,240
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

623
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,480
All the races live on the same land.

624
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,310
Naturally, they see the same moon.

625
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,730
â™«You are the light I yearn forâ™«

626
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,380
You talked a lot today.

627
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,770
What exactly are you trying to say?

628
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,190
â™«You are my determined way homeâ™«

629
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,510
Didn't I tell you?

630
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,450
Staying up late making elixirs is very boring.

631
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,340
Boring?

632
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,920
â™«Let this moment stay foreverâ™«

633
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,960
Am I just your entertainment?

634
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,760
Not really.

635
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,590
It's just that when I'm bored,

636
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,480
â™«I'm hugging you in the crowdâ™«

637
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,110
I naturally think of a boring person.

638
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,110
Bai Shuo.

639
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,480
I have things to do. I have to go.

640
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,240
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

641
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,070
Master.

642
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,970
Master.

643
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,620
Why are there still so many?

644
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,170
Previously, when you went to Ning'an City,

645
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,660
matters piled up in the Polar Region.

646
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,260
Everyone is waiting for you to make decisions.

647
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,260
Then why

648
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,270
were even trivial matters like disputes

649
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,640
presented to me?

650
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,710
There's no choice.

651
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,800
Among the thousands of demons in the Polar Region,

652
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,300
no one respects anyone else.

653
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,890
The only one they respect is you, the Master.

654
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,590
If you don't decide the outcome or make a ruling,

655
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,320
they'll keep fighting forever.

656
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,250
So, Master,

657
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,260
please bear with it

658
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,060
and finish reading these files.

659
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,470
Wait.

660
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,140
What can I do for you?

661
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,490
I have a question.

662
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,570
What do you think of when you're bored?

663
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,090
When I'm bored?

664
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,150
Drinking, fighting and sleeping.

665
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,120
I mean, what person do you think of?

666
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,320
I do think of someone.

667
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Who is it?

668
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,430
Can I not tell you?

669
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,620
Why?

670
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,420
I'm embarrassed to tell you the person I like.

671
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,210
Master, I'll leave you to your work.

672
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,070
I'll put these over there for you.

673
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,750
The person she likes?

674
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,540
You killed him?

675
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,490
Yes.

676
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,910
Chong Zhao trespassed into the Cold Spring Palace's territory.

677
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,210
Lady Fu Ling, not only didn't you capture him,

678
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,140
but you also killed one of your own.

679
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,530
What exactly are you planning to do?

680
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,870
I'm getting more and more confused.

681
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,600
I don't need you to understand.

682
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,760
What?

683
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,610
Is the life of the bear demon not worth anything?

684
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,970
Or is it that

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,590
in your heart,

686
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,770
you only care about Chong Zhao's life?

687
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,080
When you used little demons to practice,

688
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,130
did you ever care about their lives?

689
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,170
Besides,

690
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,270
this bear demon almost ruined my plan.

691
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,420
He deserved to die.

692
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,750
For such a trivial matter,

693
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,990
you actually came to report to the Grand Master.

694
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,390
I really underestimated how petty you are.

695
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,260
Enough.

696
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,400
Are you done?

697
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,170
Fu Ling,

698
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,940
tell me about your plan.

699
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,380
Grand Master, you once taught us

700
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,690
that when someone wants something,

701
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,040
we should give it to them.

702
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,090
Even if it's fake,

703
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,680
it must be convincing.

704
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,900
Chong Zhao is investigating the truth behind his parents' deaths,

705
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
but he has no leads.

706
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,530
At this point, if I give him a clueâ€”

707
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,220
whether it's real or notâ€”

708
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,890
he will cling onto it.

709
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,260
As long as he wants to investigate,

710
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,940
he will have no choice

711
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,030
but to fall into my trap.

712
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,990
Lady Fu Ling,

713
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,000
you truly are a master of strategy.

714
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,220
But don't say I didn't remind you.

715
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,680
You'd better settle this quickly

716
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,480
to avoid future complications.

717
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,750
And don't let any other thoughts take root,

718
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,950
or you might disgrace your identity as the Young Lord of Cold Spring Palace.

719
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,210
Alright.

720
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,430
Since

721
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,550
he has an obsession he can't let go of,

722
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,690
we'll help him strengthen it.

723
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,900
Once he has an inner demon,

724
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,900
he will

725
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,170
be of use to the Cold Spring Palace.

726
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,150
Fu Ling,

727
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,110
I want you

728
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,050
to use every means possible

729
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,790
to force him to abandon being an Eternal, become a demon,

730
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,590
and join

731
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,940
our Cold Spring Palace.

732
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,470
Yes.

733
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,240
Master!

734
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Master!

735
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,030
What happened?

736
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,800
Did

737
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,370
the alchemy furnace explode again?

738
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,270
I made it!

739
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,630
Not bad, my disciple.

740
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,280
You can make a second-grade elixir already!

741
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,560
I didn't misjudge you after all.

742
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,300
This time,

743
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,140
I can give Fan Yue a report.

744
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,810
Why should you report to him?

745
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,330
If she fails to learn anything,

746
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,220
I'll strip you of your 1000-year-old turtle shell.

747
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,310
Luckily, your comprehension is exceptional.

748
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,030
It looks like my 1000-year-old turtle shell is safe now.

749
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,440
Today is a good day.

750
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,600
I'll go and get a couple of bottles...

751
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,720
of nectar.

752
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,750
Let's celebrate.

753
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,030
Again?

754
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,790
Yes!

755
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,960
Didn't you go to get the nectar?

756
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,760
How did you come back so quickly?

757
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,770
Bai Shuo?

758
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,790
It's you?

759
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,590
You escaped from the Demon Race?

760
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,340
Are you here to seek help from our Eternal Race?

761
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,270
No, wait.

762
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,640
You are a human.

763
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,570
How did you enter the Eternal Sect?

764
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,190
And why are you hiding here with Old Turtle?

765
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,340
Tell me!

766
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,570
What happened?

767
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Sir, you sure have a big temper.

768
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,530
You just saw me, and now you want to get physical already.

769
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,270
That day, you were kidnapped by Master Bright Moon.

770
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,040
The Eternal Sect sent countless disciples to search for you in the Polar Region.

771
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,560
Now that you've appeared in the Eternal Sect,

772
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,410
come with me to meet the Sect Leader!

773
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,210
You're not looking for me.

774
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,150
You're looking for the Desireless Stone.

775
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,790
The Desireless Stone belongs to the Eternals!

776
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,640
It should stay in Lanling!

777
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,030
But I don't belong to the Eternals.

778
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,360
It makes no difference!

779
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,720
You're carrying a demonic object.

780
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,950
Who are you trying to send a message to?

781
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,000
Is it Master Bright Moon?

782
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,940
I've always said that humans are hard to predict,

783
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,790
and they're easily controlled by demons.

784
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,680
You're a human carrying the Desireless Stone.

785
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,480
Don't even think about leaving!

786
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,200
Chong Zhao!

787
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,160
Get out of my way!

788
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,200
Bai Shuo is innocent.

789
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,590
Uncle Master, you can't kill her!

790
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,400
Shut up!

791
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,880
Don't forget who you are.

792
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,240
She carries the Desireless Stone

793
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,350
and is colluding with the Demon Race.

794
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,310
She is an enemy to our entire Eternal Race!

795
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,840
Don't be so blind!

796
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,590
I'm not the one who's blind.

797
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,860
You are!

798
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
Are you saying I'm blind to right and wrong?

799
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,260
I dare not disobey you.

800
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,940
But if you insist on this,

801
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,960
I will have no choice but to go against you!

802
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,880
You are beyond help!

803
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,750
Enough!

804
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,890
Chong Zhao,

805
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,900
this has nothing to do with you.

806
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,760
Entering the Demon Palace that day

807
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,360
was my own choice.

808
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,030
Just like now, I choose not to stay with the Eternals.

809
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,690
As an Eternal, you want to kill a human.

810
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,190
As long as you're at peace with it,

811
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,320
go ahead.

812
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,810
Stop.

813
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,380
Sect Leader, you came at just the right time.

814
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,360
Bai Shuo is colluding with the Demon Race

815
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,060
and sneaked into Lanling. Her intentions must be malicious.

816
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,390
She must be eliminated!

817
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,770
Sect Leader, are you going to kill me too?

818
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,580
Lanling Sect will not kill an innocent person.

819
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,890
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

820
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,380
So, are you willing to let me go?

821
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,010
Of course,

822
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
that's impossible.

823
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,889
The Desireless Stone concerns the peace of the world.

824
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,920
As the Sect Leader of Lanling,

825
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,230
I can never allow it to fall into the hands of the demons.

826
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,920
Master!

827
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,489
What do you want?

828
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,389
Rather than letting you return to the Demon Race,

829
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,170
it's better to...

830
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,469
make you forget it.

831
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,400
West sun mountain.

832
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,310
East moon river.

833
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,409
A snake slithers across the grass.

834
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,310
A fish leaps above the sandy sea.

835
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,120
The earth knows, but the sky does not.

836
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,720
Only by stepping in can you find the way.

837
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,710
The head of the Eternal Sect

838
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,440
actually laid hands on a human.

839
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,310
I think

840
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,250
Lanling Sect

841
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,170
should just change its name to Lanling Evil Sect.

842
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:28,900
Fan Yue!

843
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,890
How dare you break into our Eternal Sect?

844
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,480
Give us Bai Shuo!

845
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,650
I'm here to take you back.

846
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,720
Shuo!

847
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,660
You can't go back to the Demon Race with him!

848
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,930
Fan Yue,

849
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,560
are you really going to go against the entire Eternal Sect?

850
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,500
Bai Shuo is mine.

851
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,790
I allowed her to stay temporarily in the Eternal Sect,

852
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,390
but that doesn't mean Lanling Sect has the right to keep her here.

853
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,140
Sect Leader,

854
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,370
that turtle shell...

855
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,950
It looks familiar.

856
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,760
So familiar.

857
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,890
Sect Leader, I'm innocent!

858
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,400
I was forced by Fan Yue to become Bai Shuo's teacher

859
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,670
for a few days as a way of repaying his favor.

860
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,760
The fact that the Desireless Stone was stolen

861
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,480
has nothing to do with me!

862
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,570
Stop making excuses.

863
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,980
If you hadn't given him the turtle shell,

864
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,090
how could he have broken into our Lanling Sect?

865
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,310
When I gave him the shell to repay his kindness,

866
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,600
I didn't know he was the Demon King.

867
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
Your words alone aren't enough to prove it!

868
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,770
Sect Leader,

869
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm utterly loyal to Lanling.

870
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,710
Heaven and Earth are my witness.

871
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,020
I didn't betray you!

872
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,320
Please, spare me!

873
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
Master,

874
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,260
Old Turtle has been making elixirs for the Eternals for many years.

875
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,160
This time, he was forced by Fan Yue.

876
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
Master, please forgive him.

877
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,650
You have no right to plead for Old Turtle!

878
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,160
You dared to attack your teacher,

879
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,460
and you even said I can't tell right from wrong.

880
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,710
It seems the 300 lashes weren't enough for you!

881
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,150
You need a few more!

882
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I didn't mean to offend you.

883
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,150
But if you try to kill Bai Shuo,

884
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,970
I can't just stand by and watch.

885
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,160
I believe

886
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,120
killing innocent people is not something the Eternals should do.

887
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,190
Sect Leader, did you hear that?

888
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,920
He said I kill innocent people!

889
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,990
Alright, Jing Lei.

890
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,190
Stop making things difficult for Chong Zhao.

891
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,920
We've watched him grow up.

892
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,190
We know him very well.

893
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,240
As for Old Turtleâ€¦

894
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,680
Lanling

895
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
has been using

896
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,370
the black turtle as our totem.

897
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,710
If we really punish him,

898
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,360
we'll become

899
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
the laughingstock of the 72 Sects.

900
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,110
So, I'm the bad guy now?

901
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,070
Are you saying we won't punish either of them?

902
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,920
Then tell me, what should we do?

903
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,590
Calm down.

904
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
Keep your voice down.

905
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,900
You're about to burst my eardrums.

906
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Old Turtle,

907
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,280
let me ask you.

908
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
Since Fan Yue

909
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,910
was able to use your turtle shell to enter our Lanling,

910
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,550
can we use the same shell

911
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,310
to find the Bright Moon Palace?

912
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,590
I've sensed it.

913
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,370
Fan Yue has already

914
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,230
destroyed the teleportation turtle shell he gave me.

915
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,870
Now, no one can pass through.

916
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,060
You contacted our enemies

917
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,320
and leaked our techniques.

918
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
What's the use of keeping you?

919
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,850
He's not entirely useless.

920
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,110
Old Turtle's alchemy skills

921
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,900
are considered one of the unique arts of us Eternals.

922
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,970
The elixirs he makes,

923
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,480
if sold to the villages down the mountain,

924
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,990
could bring us some more money.

925
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,820
You want to spare him for just a little money?

926
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,260
A little money?

927
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,480
Senior Jing Lei,

928
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,370
why don't you make some money and show me?

929
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,050
Okay!

930
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,880
Sell it!

931
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,520
Give it to her!

932
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,370
Give it to her!

933
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,150
Give it to her!

934
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,670
-Give it to her!
-Stop it!

935
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,440
Listen to me! Give it to her!

936
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Stop it!

937
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,070
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

938
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,650
Old Turtle,

939
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,960
how about this?

940
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,230
You've been in the sect for years.

941
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,920
You haven't made any significant contributions,

942
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,650
nor have you put in much effort.

943
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,640
You'll be punished

944
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,790
by making 100 more Great Restoration Elixirs every month.

945
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,770
The money from selling them will be used to support the sect.

946
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,850
That's all for now.

947
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,750
100 elixirs?

948
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,640
Doesn't that mean I'll be worked to death?

949
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,980
You're reluctant, aren't you?

950
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,900
In that case,

951
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,240
we'll have to strip off your turtle shell,

952
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,270
break your spiritual bone,

953
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,070
and then...

954
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,160
Say no more.

955
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,930
I'm willing.

956
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm willing.

957
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,710
Go!

958
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,180
Sect Leader,

959
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,620
Bai Shuo can activate the Desireless Stone,

960
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,110
and she doesn't align with the Eternals.

961
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,500
Please give the order,

962
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,260
and I'll immediately lead the troops to the Demon Race

963
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,590
and bring Bai Shuo back.

964
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,440
I also request to go.

965
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,030
Last time, we sent disciples

966
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,000
to investigate the location of the Bright Moon Palace,

967
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,220
but we still haven't made any progress.

968
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,330
This Fan Yue,

969
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,180
relying on the fact that the Eternal Race can't find him,

970
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,370
is too arrogant.

971
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,840
Is Fan Yue only relying on the fact that the Eternal Race can't find him?

972
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,590
There are only a few of us here.

973
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,180
Let's face the truth.

974
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,020
Even if we find the Bright Moon Palace,

975
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,140
we still won't be able to get Bai Shuo back.

976
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,530
-Feng Yu.
-Youâ€¦

977
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,110
Can you stop always discouraging everyone?

978
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,150
You should encourage us more.

979
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm just telling the truth.

980
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,220
It's better than you guys

981
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,160
deceiving yourselves.

982
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,330
Come on, you...

983
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,270
Alright.

984
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,480
Feng Yu was right.

985
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,270
The key to this matter is not Fan Yue,

986
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,120
but Bai Shuo herself.

987
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,960
Alright, dismiss.

988
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,900
Well, Sect Leader...

989
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,220
Dismissed.

990
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,200
Fine.

991
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,270
What else do you want to say?

992
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,790
I feel like

993
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,250
you're deliberately avoiding

994
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,980
bringing back Bai Shuo and the Desireless Stone.

995
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,850
I, Jin Yao, the 68th Sect Leader of Lanling,

996
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,540
am here to respectfully hear the ancestral teachings of the sect.

997
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,070
Lanling Sect Leader, listen to the order.

998
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,990
The Desireless Stone will be awakened by a human girl.

999
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,160
She is the only one in this world who can activate the divine stone.

1000
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,550
If she appears,

1001
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,960
Lanling must assist her in activating the Desireless Stone.

1002
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,330
This divine decree

1003
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,750
is known only

1004
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,310
to the Sect Leaders of Lanling.

1005
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,670
I will obey the divine decree.

1006
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,800
The ancestral teachings of Lanling

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,710
have been passed down for tens of thousands of years.

1008
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,840
We have been waiting for the human girl

1009
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,940
who can activate the Desireless Stone.

1010
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,440
Now that

1011
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,340
Bai Shuo can awaken the Desireless Stone,

1012
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,110
she must be the fated one

1013
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,880
in the divine decree.

1014
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,270
Isn't this Wutong Heart Flame?

1015
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,680
Could the next Contemplation appear in Yi City?

1016
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,310
Wutong Heart Flame?

1017
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,530
Yi City?

1018
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,850
Wutong Heart Flame only appears in Yi City.

1019
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,820
And Yi City

1020
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,590
is where the Yi Clan lives.

1021
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,820
Yi Clan?

1022
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,330
I've never heard of it.

1023
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,370
Yi Clan is naturally strong,

1024
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,320
with incredible strength.

1025
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,500
However, due to their limited bloodline,

1026
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,640
their cultivation is mediocre.

1027
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,440
No matter how hard they try,

1028
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,560
they can only cultivate the lowest-level magic.

1029
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,270
They have always been discriminated against by the Eternals and demons,

1030
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,000
so they live far away in Yi City.

1031
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,980
Then what are we waiting for?

1032
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,380
Let's depart immediately.

1033
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,340
Yi City

1034
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,410
is a moving city in the desert,

1035
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,840
with its location constantly shifting.

1036
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,990
It is usually invisible and impossible to find.

1037
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,710
It only opens during the annual

1038
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,770
Wutong Martial Arts Contest,

1039
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,520
and only on that day

1040
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,870
can everyone know its exact location.

1041
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,060
So mysterious?

1042
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,130
What is Wutong Martial Arts Contest?

1043
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,280
A thousand years ago, the Eternal Race and Demon Race

1044
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,330
fought endlessly, battling over territories with heavy casualties.

1045
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,710
So, the Eternal Lord and Demon King at the time

1046
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,630
proposed that the two races

1047
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,840
hold an annual martial arts contest to settle their territorial disputes.

1048
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,960
The King of Yi,

1049
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,640
wanting to reconcile with the Eternals and demons,

1050
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,700
agreed to host the contest in Yi City,

1051
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,630
with three spirit pills made from Wutong Heart Flame

1052
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,960
as the prize for the winner.

1053
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Wutong Spirit Pill

1054
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,550
is an extremely pure and sacred treasure.

1055
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,340
Those who use it

1056
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,600
can greatly increase their spiritual power

1057
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,080
and improve their cultivation.

1058
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,840
In the Desireless Stone, I foresaw

1059
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,860
many disciples from both the Eternal Race and Demon Race gathering in Yi City.

1060
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,370
It seems they are preparing for the second Contemplation.

1061
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,360
We not only need to enter Yi City,

1062
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,820
but we also have to hold the Wutong Martial Arts Contest,

1063
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,160
allowing disciples from both races

1064
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,640
to enter the city as well.

1065
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,580
It has been seven years since Yi City last held the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

1066
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,180
Why has it suddenly stopped?

1067
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,640
Could something have happened in Yi City?

1068
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,340
Why do you have so many questions?

1069
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,730
I'm not only doing this for myself;

1070
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,170
it's also to help your Master.

1071
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,170
Are you still going to keep things from me?

1072
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,960
No one is keeping anything.

1073
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,160
No one knows why Yi City is closed,

1074
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,570
nor does anyone know

1075
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,730
where Yi City is now.

1076
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,970
You just said

1077
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,600
Yi City is a moving city in the desert?

1078
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,420
That's right.

1079
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,560
What if I tell you

1080
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,110
I might know where it is?

1081
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,170
How could you possibly know?

1082
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,790
The Desireless Stone showed me

1083
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,100
a desert

1084
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,460
and a children's rhyme.

1085
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,330
Not everything in this world can be explained

1086
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,940
or answered clearly.

1087
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,970
I'm doing this

1088
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,720
for my reasons.

1089
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,250
Chong Zhao,

1090
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,840
do you trust me?

1091
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,340
Of course I do.

1092
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,690
But Shuo is with the Demon Race.

1093
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,180
I'm worried about her.

1094
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,300
Don't worry.

1095
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,100
Master Bright Moon

1096
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,810
needs her to activate the Desireless Stone.

1097
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,810
He won't harm her for now.

1098
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,320
All we need to do now

1099
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,400
is wait for the right opportunity.

1100
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,460
Do you understand?

1101
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,400
You seem troubled.

1102
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,100
Is there something else?

1103
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,450
Master,

1104
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,050
I found Qian Yin's tombstone.
