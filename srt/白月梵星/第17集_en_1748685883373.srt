1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Go forward biblical

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish I was as good as the stars and the moon.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is here.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only wish to watch every star and moon with my beloved.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be with you forever.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The fairy demon is a loser.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You and her are not the same person.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I only wish to be with you forever.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I only wish to see every star and moon with my beloved.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The world is here.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We are here.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The world is here.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We are here.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The world is here.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are here together.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are here together.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The world is here.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We are here together.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are here together.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We are here together.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We are here together.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We are here together.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's the trouble?

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Your hands are full of blood.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's why, you have talisman on.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's the problem?

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We want to essasились with you.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
after下戰, he was not the only one,

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
therefore, there is rule in a bluffing way.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't you think he has an issue?

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello, Chong Zhao.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,500
He treats me like you're in heaven.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,800
He's never hurt me.

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Then I won't be in trouble with Cangshan.

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,300
You won't leave Cangshan.

37
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,000
Chongzhao is a bit off now.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
I just want to comfort him.

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,100
What's wrong?

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Then you're right.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,500
Then why?

43
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,700
You two are so close.

44
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,900
If it weren't for you and me,

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,800
we wouldn't even have met.

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
So when the water is over,

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll give you the thing.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
We're even now.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Cangshan

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
What did you say?

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Since you want to give me two kisses,

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
it's good.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
The water is to save my life.

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
I can manage my own life.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
I can find the thing myself.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I won't bother you anymore.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,600
A'Huo.

58
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,400
Why are you here?

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
Auntie has agreed to our wedding.

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Go back with me.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
You're just in time.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Mujiu,

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
since you grew up in Huzu,

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
have you seen a

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
famous dish of food?

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
A famous dish of food?

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How could Qingyong Mountain have such a thing?

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
But,

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,200
I know a dish of food.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
This is the tree you mentioned?

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes, it's called Qing Shu.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
You know the name of our Huzu chain.

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
The origin of the tree

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
is our inner love.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Every new little fox

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
will find love in the inner

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
of the tree

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,600
when he meets the blessing of Qing Shu.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
So this tree is our Huzu's

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
ancestral base.

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
It's definitely not the tree you want to find.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
It's definitely not the tree you want to find.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You have to look at me.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Why?

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Because Qing Shu feels love.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
When you look at me,

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
when you love Qing Shu,

88
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
it will fill your heart.

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Try it again.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm bored.

91
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm not interested.

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Then I'll try it.

93
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
What's going on?

94
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Why didn't you respond?

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
Uncle told me.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No need to try it.

97
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
It has nothing to do with me.

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
I have to find the tree of the food.

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll take my leave.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,600
No.

101
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
You believe me?

103
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I really like you.

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
This tree is so old.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,000
It's useless.

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Fire.

107
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
You're so stupid.

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Fire.

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
You can't believe it.

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Fire.

111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Huzu Qing Shu.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
It's so ridiculous.

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Fulin.

114
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Come here.

115
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,400
I've brought the firewood with me.

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Qing Shu didn't get lost

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
and attacked them.

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
But he attacked me.

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Why?

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Is it because I'm not Huzu?

121
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

122
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
What do you know about this?

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I don't know.

124
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

125
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,800
Are you looking for Tianhua?

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Huzu is a good girl.

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
If she hadn't met me,

128
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
she wouldn't have been in a good mood.

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,800
It seems like she's in a good mood.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
But you were married that year.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
I didn't order you to get married.

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
This is what my sister left.

133
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
It's the most important thing for me.

134
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Is the sister of the mountain master

135
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
the Holy Lady of the Dragon?

136
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
How do you know about the Dragon?

137
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Because I know you're Awu.

138
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss Bai, you know my name.

139
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Didn't I tell you?

140
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
In the process,

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
we've been together for a long time.

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
We've entered the Kunlun Prefecture.

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,200
We've been talking about the fate of the dead.

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
We've witnessed the death of the Holy Lady of the Dragon

145
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
and the death of the former Lord of the Dragon.

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
And that tragedy.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Among the fate,

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,800
I've been the one who showed you my true identity.

149
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,800
I've seen the girl, Zhen Mei'er.

150
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
I didn't expect that someone would mention her.

151
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
The thief of the Dragon.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
And the one who's trying to remember my sister.

153
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
I've killed almost all the people of the Mountain of the Dragon.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
My sister was so heartless and cruel.

155
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,800
And she was so heartless and cruel.

156
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
She even had a little thought

157
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
to stay in this world.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,600
She was so absurd.

159
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't worry, Lady.

160
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,600
The incident of that time was a fact.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
Senior Rong Xian was also killed by the Kunlun people.

162
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
That's why he made a big mistake.

163
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
He's not a fake for the sake of the Holy Lady of the Dragon.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
Miss Bai,

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
this is my family matter.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Why are you so concerned about the Kunlun people?

167
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

168
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,400
I just got a chance to find out the truth.

169
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
I know it's the new chapter of the Mountain of the Dragon.

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,600
That's why...

171
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
No need.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a thousand years since the incident.

173
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Why do you mention it?

174
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Please take Miss Bai back to the Sky Fire.

175
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Just treat it as a wedding gift from my aunt.

176
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Please.

177
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Chief!

178
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Chief!

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I need to see you!

180
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Chief!

181
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Didn't you see any guests?

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Hurry and go out.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm here to report you.

184
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
That matter has been settled.

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
No one is discussing it now.

186
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
But I don't know how long it will take.

187
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,800
So I'm asking you to make a decision.

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll tell you one last time.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll sort it out myself.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Get out!

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Changsheng, Zhang Lao!

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Please wait.

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
I have something to ask you.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What is it?

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're a small girl.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
You should go to the Moon Palace.

197
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't have time.

198
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I think you're a good person.

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
You're straightforward and good-tempered.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
You're a little boy beside Chief.

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not a little boy.

202
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Are you Qi?

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
What little boy?

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know him.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
I'm only 300 years old.

206
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
How do you know what happened a thousand years ago?

207
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Only 300 years old?

208
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
So you've never experienced the things

209
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
about Rongxian and Lingrong.

210
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
How did you become the chief of the Hu tribe?

211
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Rongxian is a thief.

212
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,800
He nearly killed the whole Hu tribe a thousand years ago.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,800
He died in that battle.

214
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
If he wasn't a good person,

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
you'd be willing to do this.

216
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
You wouldn't have been the chief.

217
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Go, go, go.

218
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Don't let me do the right thing.

219
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
In the Moon Mirror,

220
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Linglong said he was a little boy.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
If he wasn't a common man,

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
who would it be?

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Uncle Bai,

224
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
what's the relationship

225
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
between the little boy and us

226
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
that we're about to do?

227
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
I saw the same scar on Changmei's back

228
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,200
as you did today.

229
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
This means

230
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
if he wasn't the one who attacked you,

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
he must be the one who knew.

232
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Then Changmei isn't a bad person.

233
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
No, I have to tell the chief.

234
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Stop!

235
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Sit down.

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Didn't I say that

237
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
the scene of the Five Nights

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,400
is dangerous in the Moon Mirror?

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
What we're going to do now

240
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
is to find the Moon Moon in the Moon Water Stone

241
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
and not let it get into danger.

242
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
I've been with you for a while.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,200
You and I are all together

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,400
to protect the Moon Moon.

245
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Why are you not with me?

246
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Do you want to watch him

247
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
being swallowed by that monster

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
just like you?

249
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
It seems to be a reason.

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
If the Moon Water Stone is in Changmei's hand,

251
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
we must know

252
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
how to get it out.

253
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I thought that

254
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
it would be useful to help him

255
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
to get rid of the Star Festival.

256
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
But I didn't expect that

257
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
he would react so well today.

258
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Changmei also said

259
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
he didn't have any red circle in his name.

260
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
But at that time,

261
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Shi Wei and Qi were known

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
to be in a relationship with Wu.

263
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,600
What happened in the past thousand years?

264
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Only by finding Xiao Ba

265
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
can we find out the truth.

266
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
What is this?

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
This is Changmei's wedding gift

268
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
for Tian Huo and Mu Jiu.

269
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Just in case,

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
bring it to him.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What?

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Tian Huo is getting married with Mu Jiu?

273
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
We searched the whole Hu tribe today.

274
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
The letter that was written by Fu He and Bai Shuo

275
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
is just like that.

276
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
There must be something wrong with the letter.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,200
But I went with Mu Jiu today.

278
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
It was very quiet.

279
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
There was nothing wrong.

280
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
There are no other clues now.

281
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Let's go and check it out at night.

282
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
But, Master,

283
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
you have a wound.

284
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Why do you even start to suspect me now?

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Master,

286
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
I'm just worried that

287
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
you won't suspect me.

288
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
I have two of my seven-star firewoods.

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They are far from the water in the mountain.

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They are always injured.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,800
No one can take my life.

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
But it doesn't mean that you won't be injured.

293
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
That's what Bai Shuo said.

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
What?

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
How do you think that

296
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
since Bai Shuo came to the Hall of Fame,

297
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
you two have become strange.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
You always say that in the Demon Clan.

299
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
And also, Cang Shan.

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
Even the Demon Clan can't take the Demon Lord away.

301
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
That's ridiculous.

302
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
We have changed.

303
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Why hasn't the Hall of Fame changed?

304
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
The Hall of Fame has changed.

305
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
The Hall of Fame used to

306
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
only think about taking away the seven-star firewoods.

307
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
No matter what the Cicada Clan can do,

308
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
they won't change their target.

309
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
But now, the Hall of Fame

310
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,200
can say something that will give up the memory.

311
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Isn't that a change?

312
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,000
That's because...

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because you like Bai Shuo.

314
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
Because you like him.

315
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
So you have his life in your heart.

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And he has your life.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
But, Hall Master.

318
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,000
Bai Shuo is also important to you.

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Since you two are all thinking for each other,

320
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,000
you should protect yourself.

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't let him worry.

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,800
I understand.

323
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,200
When the water is over,

324
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,600
I will tell him.

325
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Do you like Mujiu?

326
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,400
Everyone is like that.

327
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
Look at others.

328
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Look at yourself.

329
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait for the dark.

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
You and I have been together for years.

331
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,600
I also hope that you can let go of your feelings.

332
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Find someone who wants to be with you.

333
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
The Hall of Fame has orders.

334
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
There are a lot of people in the tribe today.

335
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
When we search carefully,

336
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,800
we can't let go of suspicious people.

337
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Yes.

338
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
You also came.

339
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Feng Qiao went to the Lake Tribe's Golden Land and looked around.

340
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
She accidentally moved a few of her hands.

341
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
That's why she left a mark.

342
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Jing You Mountain is not a place of movement.

343
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,000
Please let the Demon Lord Fulin know.

344
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If he changes his target,

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
it won't be easy for the Princess to explain.

346
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't worry.

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I've made up a wonderful plan for you.

348
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What do you want to do?

349
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I warn you.

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's my mission to capture Bai Shuo.

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't worry.

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I won't force your hand.

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The Outer Tribe will attack the Lake Tribe.

354
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I will lure Fan Yue to the beast tonight.

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You take the chance to capture Bai Shuo.

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait.

357
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Who's there?

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I got him.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Stop!

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hurry!

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Stop!

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Stop!

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Stop!

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Aunt,

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I forgot to tell you that I came back.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't be so angry.

367
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What do you want to know?

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll tell you everything.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Forget it.

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's useless to talk about it all the time.

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm just asking you one thing.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Have you noticed

373
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Linglong and Rongxian's children in the forest?

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've seen them.

375
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Fan Yue changed her fate in the forest.

376
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She saved Linglong's daughter's child.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She's been seriously injured.

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But, Aunt,

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the forest is not a stone.

380
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The fate of the outer tribe

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
can really change the reality.

382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So,

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it's Fan Yue?

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Aunt,

385
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Aunt.

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Aunt.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Aunt, it's okay.

388
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Xiaojiu,

389
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
did the gods ask you

390
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
about the food?

391
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I did ask them.

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I don't know what it is.

393
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I've asked other people.

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I've never heard of it.

395
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Aunt,

396
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
do you know what the food is?

397
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Xiaojiu,

398
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
listen to aunt.

399
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You're going to marry the gods tomorrow.

400
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
According to the rules of our tribe,

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you can't meet them again.

402
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Not only the gods,

403
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but also the people in the Hall of Fame.

404
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why?

405
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's no reason.

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Anyway, if you want to leave the outer tribe,

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
you must listen to me.

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Aunt,

409
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
are you sick?

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Tell me.

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What can I do if I have something to do?

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I've been suffering

413
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
from too much fever these days.

414
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You can leave first.

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, right.

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let Elder Chang Wu come over.

417
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll pick you out.

418
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,000
Alright.

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then.

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Next time.

421
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The best proposal.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Look,

423
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll work hard,

424
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and I'll help everyone.

425
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mr.GLISH.

426
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I only know

427
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
who is full of bullies.

428
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You...

429
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Huo.

430
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,040
Look at him.

431
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,840
He's not even a good friend.

432
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
He's just a friend.

433
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
Why is he

434
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,600
a friend of the same family?

435
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
You're too careless.

436
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
You're making me angry.

437
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,600
You're talking nonsense.

438
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,960
You're the one who's talking nonsense.

439
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,040
You're making me angry.

440
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,680
How could he marry you?

441
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
Let go of me.

442
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Cang Shang.

443
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
You misunderstood.

444
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,200
I meant the marriage.

445
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
What?

446
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
But...

447
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
It's just a fake marriage.

448
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,400
It's not about the love between men and women.

449
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
It's just a marriage.

450
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
I knew it.

451
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
How could you like him?

452
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
But you can't even

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
have a wedding with a marriage.

454
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
Why not?

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Because...

456
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Because of the marriage...

457
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Because of the marriage,

458
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the owner has to die.

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
Cang Shang.

460
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,400
You're the one who agreed to marry me.

461
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,200
What are you talking about?

462
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
The owner's life.

463
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
The eyes of the warehouse.

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I get it.

465
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
He's standing here

466
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
to take your elders.

467
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Huo.

468
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Cang Shang is right.

469
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
He's just a friend.

470
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,800
He's just a friend?

471
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
The power of the Cold Spring Palace

472
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
hasn't been turned down.

473
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It's just a few miles away.

474
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm here.

475
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Let's go.

476
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Master Wu.

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is the address of the lady

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,400
who brought the owner of the house.

479
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Go and have a look.

480
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Master Wu.

481
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
It's so late.

482
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
What's wrong with you?

483
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Miss Bai.

484
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
There are a few outsiders in the forest.

485
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Many of our people

486
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
were injured by them by the evil magic.

487
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Some people came to see you

488
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
and you didn't know you were here.

489
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Miss.

490
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I didn't see you.

491
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
If you find anything suspicious,

492
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
you can call me.

493
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Our people are all in the forest tonight.

494
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I won't bother you.

495
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Let's go.

496
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
You hurt the Hu tribe.

497
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You won't hurt anyone.

498
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Why?

499
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Uncle.

500
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
There are many things I can't tell you now.

501
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
But you believe me.

502
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I have no evil intentions towards you.

503
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
While they are searching for people in the forest,

504
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
you can leave with me right now.

505
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I can't leave.

506
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Because of Fan Yue?

507
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
She won't come to control you.

508
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
It's a rare opportunity.

509
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
If she doesn't leave,

510
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
she won't come to control you.

511
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
It's an opportunity.

512
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
What did you do to Fan Yue?

513
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Right?

514
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Chongzhao.

515
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
What are you doing?

516
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Are you trying to lie to me again?

517
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
It's not me.

518
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
It's Fulin.

519
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
The people in Lengquan Palace want to take you back.

520
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Now, Fulin has taken Fan Yue to the Qing tree.

521
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
The land is broken into bones.

522
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
He can definitely take Fan Yue away.

523
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
If you don't leave now,

524
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
there will be more trouble in the future.

525
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I will send you back to the old home.

526
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
He will protect you.

527
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Fan Yue went to the Qing tree?

528
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I don't know.

529
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I will do as Fan Yue did.

530
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I said that she is in danger now.

531
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Even if it's not the right time,

532
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I have never thought about leaving her.

533
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
You and Lengquan Palace

534
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
will ask her when I come back.

535
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Fan Yue is the demon.

536
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
He only thinks of you as a child.

537
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Shuang,

538
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
why don't you understand?

539
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Maybe it was the first time.

540
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
After Ning'an City,

541
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
she has been taking me seriously.

542
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Now she is hiding everything from me.

543
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
She doesn't want to say anything.

544
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Isn't it you?

545
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I am not the same as before.

546
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I won't be so easy to trust others.

547
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Fan Yue is the demon.

548
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
That's right.

549
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
But she is better than the first one.

550
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Shuang,

551
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
don't let me down again.

552
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Put it down.

553
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
There are many things in my dream.

554
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
That year,

555
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
that year,

556
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
I couldn't open the eyes

557
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I was afraid of the wind that would turn away the thought.

558
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I have to think of a way

559
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Let him get close to the Qing tree.

560
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,720
He went to the door to find the tree

561
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
and found it for me.

562
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,200
It seems that you're going to trouble me

563
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
for saving the trouble.

564
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,960
I'll reward you a full loss later.

565
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,640
Thank you, Master.

566
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,000
Who would die tonight?

567
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You're so unreasonable.

568
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The Qing tree won't attack the tiger tribe,

569
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but it will swallow the owner.

570
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm afraid that Fulin won't be able to beg for the reward.

571
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Get up.

572
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Why is the Qingyou Mountain

573
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
so crowded with people from the Cold Palace?

574
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

575
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Many people are cut off by the back of their heads.

576
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They're not afraid of the wind.

577
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They're afraid of the wind.

578
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Many people are cut off by the back of their heads.

579
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The people in the cold palace

580
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
are not from the Cold Palace.

581
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The Qingyou Mountain and the Zhenyu Mountain

582
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
are all in peace.

583
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Why did they send people to trouble?

584
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's for the Qing tree.

585
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The people in the Cold Palace

586
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
actually saw our Qing tree.

587
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Didn't you hear that? The Qing tree is in a mess.

588
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's weird.

589
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Shut up.

590
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Chang Wu, take the injured to the hospital.

591
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Chang Sheng,

592
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you can't let anyone in the cold palace

593
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
who's been searched for.

594
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yes.

595
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let's go.

596
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Chief, I'll stay with you.

597
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's okay.

598
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't worry.

599
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

600
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
What Miss Bai knows

601
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
seems more than I thought.

602
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The one who should be in the cold palace

603
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
is not me.

604
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The Qing tree is in the cold palace.

605
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No matter what they do to the Qingyou Mountain,

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
they should be in the cold palace

607
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
with you tonight.

608
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You're kidding.

609
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The Qingyou Mountain and the Zhenyu Mountain

610
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
are in the cold palace.

611
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Chief,

612
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
when I told you about the Rongxian Garden,

613
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you should believe

614
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that I and the Qingyou Mountain are not evil.

615
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I heard the people talking about it.

616
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It seems that there are some problems.

617
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The people who are in the cold palace

618
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
will be in danger.

619
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Please lead me to the Qingyou Mountain.

620
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll handle other matters.

621
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

622
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I can take you there.

623
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But you must remember

624
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
that you owe me a favor.

625
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I can't get close to you.

626
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You can't get down there.

627
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This place is so quiet.

628
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You'll be shocked.

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Changmei is dead just like you.

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But you're not worried.

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Unless your goal

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
is not the real one.

633
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Fengyu.

634
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He's...

635
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He's in a dream.

636
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Now he knows it.

637
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's go.

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The Qingyou Mountain is hidden like this.

639
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The Qin tree

640
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
can create illusions and kill people.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I can kill people with my sword.

642
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Except Fan Yuan.

643
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I can't kill people with my sword.

644
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I can't kill people with my sword.

645
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Such a good chance.

646
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Chongzhao hasn't taken away the white tree.

647
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Fengyun.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Don't come near.

649
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
This is the holy tree of my clan.

650
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Master.

651
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Let go of the people.

652
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Don't worry.

653
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I can handle the demon power.

654
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'll go to the temple and let him out.

655
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Fengyu.

656
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Fengyu.

657
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Fengyu.

658
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're not afraid of the demon?

659
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You can't do it.

660
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll die with you.

661
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Fengyu.

662
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I can still kiss your face.

663
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Let go of my grudge.

664
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Like a flower in the sun.

665
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
How is it?

666
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's not heavy.

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
How is it?

668
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't worry.

669
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'll die with you.

670
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll die with you.

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm afraid that Qin Shu will have the power to kill me.

672
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I just want to go inside and investigate.

673
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Now he's destroyed.

674
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll change my mind.

675
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Qin Shu is a mountain of gold.

676
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
If he's destroyed,

677
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm afraid that Chang Mei won't be able to handle it.

678
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Don't talk about the food.

679
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's troublesome to leave.

680
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This is the place I've seen.

681
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You were also swallowed by Qin Shu.

682
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The picture of the immortal has been confirmed.

683
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But how did it happen?

684
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Watch out!

685
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This is not a corpse.

686
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It should be Shuling.

687
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
His power is not strong enough.

688
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He can't be called a corpse.

689
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It should be your blood.

690
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I've been in the mountain for years.

691
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm so sorry.

692
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The Cold Palace is really bold.

693
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You and I have been friends for years.

694
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What Fulin did today is to deal with Fan Yue.

695
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you were here,

696
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you would have killed Fulin.

697
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm sorry.

704
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm sorry.

707
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry.

709
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
If you want to threaten me,

711
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
let her come to you and kill you.

712
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The Qin Shu has a new life.

713
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Human blood?

714
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Is it because of the white tree's blood?

715
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Shuling?

716
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
How is that possible?

717
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But it can eat the Qin Shu.

718
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's the Qin Shu.

719
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The grass is green.

720
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's like a flying bird.

721
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's a new life.

722
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's the new life.

723
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If it's not true,

724
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
it's a blood loss because of the blood of the others.

725
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Qin Shu has been cultivating his spirit.

726
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It should be a evil thing.

727
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It shouldn't be the human nature we saw last night.

728
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Wait.

729
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I thought the mountain and the fire were the same.

730
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But according to your statement,

731
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the mountain is the stone.

732
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It was cultivated several thousand years ago.

733
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's not half of the fire.

734
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Uncle Bai, don't talk nonsense.

735
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm a stone.

736
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
My parents were born with human blood.

737
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's different from the demon's blood.

738
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm almost as young as the fire.

739
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Why do you care about age?

740
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's not a big deal.

741
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Now,

742
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
there are too many secrets in the Qin Shu.

743
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
When I was promoted to the father,

744
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I felt that there was a corpse under the foundation.

745
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The corpse should be a spiritual power.

746
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It must be a big deal.

747
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The spirit of the mountain is about to be destroyed.

748
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Maybe it's been lost many years ago.

749
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
These years,

750
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
it's all about the survival of the dead.

751
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's a good thing to get the spirit of the living.

752
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
In that case,

753
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the person you saw at the time

754
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
would be the wish of the corpse.

755
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Just like the fairy.

756
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I think

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I know who she is.

758
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I know who she is.

759
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't move.

760
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Chang Mei just got a cold.

761
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If she doesn't clear her mind,

762
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
she won't be able to find the medicine.

763
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There are many soldiers who search for the corpse.

764
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
One is injured.

765
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
One is in danger.

766
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I didn't find the right opportunity.

767
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'll think of a way to tell you the truth.

768
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

769
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Are you trying to explain to me?

770
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
In your heart,

771
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
you will care about my life.

772
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm not a good person.

773
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm just a good person.

774
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm just a good person.

775
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm just a good person.

776
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm just a good person.

777
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm just a good person.

778
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
In your heart,

779
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you will care about my life.

780
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You misunderstood.

781
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You planned to trap Fan Yue.

782
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You did what you thought you could.

783
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm just telling you this.

784
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't believe you.

785
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm the only one who exposed myself tonight.

786
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You could have killed me in the dark.

787
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But you still say you have no feelings for me

788
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
when you were in the scene.

789
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
If you die,

790
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I can't tell you the truth.

791
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Don't make any excuses.

792
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Bai Shu brought Chang Mei to the place of love.

793
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
She was the one who trapped Fan Yue.

794
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If you do this for her,

795
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
how could you tell her all this?

796
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Chong Zhao,

797
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'll give you one last chance.

798
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What do you think of

799
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
when you tell me the truth?

800
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What do you want to do to believe me?

801
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I've never hurt you

802
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
since you started being safe.

803
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Even if you know you're not a true family member,

804
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I've never betrayed you.

805
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Now that Qin Youshan is in danger,

806
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I can only rely on you.

807
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Bai Shu is standing by Fan Yue's side.

808
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He won't help you anymore.

809
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Can you understand?

810
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'll let you down.

811
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Let go.

812
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Fu Ling,

813
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm telling you,

814
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I only have one Bai Shu in my heart.

815
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I've never done more

816
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
than you

817
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
in your life.

818
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You don't have to

819
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
risk your life once and for all.

820
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm not going to let you down.

821
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm not going to let you down.

822
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm not going to let you down.

823
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm not going to risk my life once and for all.

824
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Stop saying that.

825
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't want to hear it.

826
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Chang Mei ordered the whole Hu tribe

827
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
to search for the traces of you and me.

828
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And then,

829
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
she only died.

830
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Chen Xianzan,

831
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you should leave now.

832
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If Zhen Yu asks,

833
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you'll say that the task is my responsibility

834
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and it has nothing to do with you.

835
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What about you?

836
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Bai Shu died

837
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in the cold palace.

838
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
After Bai Shu died,

839
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
he was the only family member

840
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
left to me.

841
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I promised Bai Shu

842
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I would always protect him.

843
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Even if I die,

844
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
since I promised him,

845
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I must do it.

846
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Whether he believes me or not,

847
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If Chang Mei has already met Fan Yue

848
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and went to Youshan,

849
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Chong Zhao would be in danger.

850
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
He only ordered

851
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Bai Shu to be back.

852
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Master,

853
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
please go with me.

854
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Are you concerned about Chong Zhao?

855
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Are you concerned about

856
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
my order?

857
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I just think

858
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
it's all my fault.

859
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I should always take care of you.

860
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Take care of you?

861
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Why didn't I notice

862
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that you are so kind and kind?

863
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Today is the day

864
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
of the Zhao's blessing.

865
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Will you betray me

866
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
for him?

867
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I dare not.

868
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If it's not you,

869
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I would have died long ago.

870
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If you and I

871
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
have any more grudges,

872
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I will never betray you

873
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because of anyone.

874
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You know,

875
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I am the most impetuous person.

876
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
All three emotions

877
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
are something that I am eager to see.

878
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The one who is born,

879
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
you are the most vulnerable person.

880
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You have been so anxious

881
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
that I have been

882
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so anxious to see you.

883
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I have been

884
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
so anxious to see you.

885
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I have brought you back to the cold world

886
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and raised you personally.

887
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You don't know how to draw,

888
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
nor how to practice.

889
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You are also my

890
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
heart-to-heart failure.

891
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's why you

892
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
have created this world.

893
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I have spent so much effort

894
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to make you

895
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
a waste of love.

896
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Do you understand?

897
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I will do as you say.

898
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I will do as you say.

899
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Get up.

900
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You and Chongzhao

901
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
are going with me.

902
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But I have made a promise

903
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that the mortal world will have a price.

904
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
If you don't

905
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
keep an eye on him

906
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and bring him back to the cold world,

907
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
then I will

908
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
return

909
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
your life to him.

910
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I will return it to him.

911
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes.

912
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You have to keep your life to him.

913
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I will keep my life to you.

914
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Chongzhao,

915
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you should think about it

916
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
in every way.

917
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I will do as you say.

918
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Awu,

919
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you are here again.

920
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Linglong will punish you

921
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
later.

922
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Who is there?

923
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Who is there?

924
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Awu,

925
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
how could you forget me?

926
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Qi.

927
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Qi.

928
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Qi.

929
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Qi.

930
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Qi, I got it.

931
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You can leave now.

932
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yes.

933
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Xiaoba.

934
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What did Miss Bai call me?

935
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Xiaoba.

936
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Isn't it you?

937
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I used to enter the old city

938
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
thousands of years ago

939
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
in the hope of staying in Rongxian.

940
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I met the mountain master

941
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and he was the sister of Linglong's daughter Awu.

942
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Awu followed the two guards

943
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
around the side of the village.

944
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Qi and Xiaoba.

945
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Qi and Awu were in a relationship.

946
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Now that we have entered the mountain,

947
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
we don't know who is more difficult to deal with.

948
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's just another person

949
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
who is a little girl with a bad temper.

950
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's only one of the two elders.

951
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
At first,

952
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I thought it was the elder of Changsheng.

953
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But he denied it.

954
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
He was so stubborn

955
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that he made people look like a fool.

956
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
If it wasn't for the weirdness of yesterday,

957
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I wouldn't dare to

958
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
think that

959
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
you have different beliefs.

960
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I wouldn't dare to do this.

961
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Mountain master,

962
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll stay with you.

963
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's okay.

964
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Don't worry.

965
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes.

966
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's been so long.

967
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I didn't expect

968
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
to be known by you as a little girl.

969
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
This name has been around for many years.

970
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
No one has ever called it.

971
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's been a long time.

972
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The new year's old people

973
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
have been in that tragedy.

974
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I once heard that

975
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
death is not scary.

976
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The most scary thing is

977
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
that the last person in the world

978
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
who remembers you

979
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
will leave.

980
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
From then on,

981
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
the memory of the person who has never existed

982
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
has been lost.

983
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Even if the elder

984
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
has almost forgotten

985
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
his own name,

986
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
he will still remember

987
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
your brotherhood.

988
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The poem under the tree of love,

989
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
is it A Qi?

990
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
How do you know?

991
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The one standing in the distance

992
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Don't be afraid

993
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The stars will only

994
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
touch you

995
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Come on, come on

996
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
My heart is like a

997
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
heart of mine

998
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm afraid

999
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Come on

1000
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
My heart is like a

1001
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
heart of mine

1002
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Wait for me

1003
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The stars will only

1004
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
touch you

1005
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You are the light I want to forget

1006
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's the lonely pain

1007
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Let this moment be with you

1008
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I want to let the sea

1009
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
pass by

1010
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The stars will only

1011
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
touch you

1012
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
You are the blue soil of my life

1013
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,920
Where my morning sun comes

1014
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,000
Let my tears show

1015
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,020
ysis once again

1016
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:26,000
I wish you will fly
