Time is there, and we are there.

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,260
I only want to see every star in the sky with the one I love.

5
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,260
I want to be with you forever.

6
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,260
The fairy demon is a loser.

7
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,260
You and her are not the same person.

8
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
The fairy demon is a loser.

9
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,260
You and her are not the same person.

PAITING IN THE NAME

20
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
I hope you can tell me everything you know.

21
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Including your past.

22
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Does my past have anything to do with what is happening now?

23
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
You can tell me everything you know.

24
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Just for Fan Yue.

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Don't take the point.

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Even if she's lost her memory,

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
it's not the way you can use her.

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I don't want to use her.

29
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm not a person who doesn't know anything.

30
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Fan Yue saved me a few times.

31
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I don't want her to die.

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
I don't want to die.

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
I don't want to die.

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
But the most dangerous thing is not me.

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,880
It's her.

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
She's re-opened the Five-Six.

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
It was Fan Yue and King Yiren's deal.

38
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
But now King Yiren is trying to kill her.

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Something must have happened.

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,880
We don't know what happened behind her.

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
We don't know what will happen in the future.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,880
But all the information is just like a clock.

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Seven years ago.

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Seven years ago, you left Yicheng.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Seven years ago, King Yiren was sealed.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
He stopped the Five-Six.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
And seven years ago, there was a monster in the city.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
There must be something wrong with these things.

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
If you don't know the answer, we can find the answer together.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Tian Hu.

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
You can not like me.

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
But you're willing to trust me once?

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
You heard about King Yiren.

54
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Seven years ago, I wanted to destroy Yicheng with King Yiren.

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
What?

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,880
King Yiren is not a simple generation.

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
It's a command from King Yiren.

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
The first King Yiren in the ship

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,880
found a few magical clouds in the East Sea.

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
It will be the King Yiren.

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,880
The power of the magical sword will be the power of King Yiren.

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,880
The power of the magical sword will be the power of King Yiren.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
That's why King Yiren has the power of the dragon.

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
King Yiren is the source of the whole of the whole of the world.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,880
But the power of the sword is not far away.

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,880
So every ten years, King Yiren needs to pull the sword

67
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
to use his own spirit to destroy the sword.

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
So King Yiren can re-re-release the sword.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
The throne is not safe for the era of the Flower Bell.

70
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Because it is so fragile.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
It can't pull out the Sword of the Winged.

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Then why does the Flower Bell still become King Yiren?

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Apart from the Flower Bell as the King's clan,

74
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Yicheng is also a family of the Mei.

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,880
The Mei family has always been in charge of supporting the Flower Bell.

76
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
They have always been important to Yicheng.

77
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
By this time,

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
General Mei is the only one who can make the world famous.

79
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
For the sake of the Flower Bell,

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,880
King Yiren and General Mei have made a deal.

81
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
What deal?

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
The Flower Bell is the Crown Princess of Mei Han.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
And the Mei family

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
has put the spirit of General Mei to the Flower Bell

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
to re-release the weak body.

86
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
General Mei is now in the Clouds.

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
And the Flower Bell has re-released the spirit of the Winged

88
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
and pulled out the Sword of the Winged.

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
It has become King Yiren's new generation.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Soon, he will take the throne and marry the Mei Han as his wife.

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Everything happened seven years ago.

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
That year, Yicheng was exposed to the storm.

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
In the dry river,

94
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,880
a so-called magical jade stone suddenly appeared.

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
The starry road, the disaster relief,

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,880
and the six words were given to my mother to die.

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Everyone was like a wind.

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
They asked to limit my mother.

99
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
You are the god.

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Even if this queen

101
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,880
was loved by them wholeheartedly.

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
The Flower Bell has been re-released.

103
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
My mother has hidden the secret.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
But the Flower Bell has exposed her true nature.

105
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Let go of me.

106
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,880
If the people don't respect the queen,

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
they will turn the Flower Bell upside down.

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
The throne of the Flower Bell

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,880
was the fate of my grandfather.

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
In her heart,

111
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
it is the most important thing.

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
In order to prevent the people from moving,

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
she gave up everything.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Flower Bell, I hate you.

115
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
You hate me, don't hate me.

116
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
The Flower Bell has been deceived.

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
She didn't protect her.

118
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
In order to protect her,

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,880
she was watching her queen die.

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
After mother died,

121
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I asked you to marry her.

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
The people forced her to die.

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,880
The Flower Bell abandoned her.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
But I think

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
they should all die for my mother.

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
So I broke into the sword.

127
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
I destroyed the Yi-Wang Sword.

128
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I destroyed Yi Cheng.

129
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Sister, stop.

130
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Yi-Wang Sword is Yi Cheng's foundation.

131
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
If it destroys Yi Cheng, it will be destroyed.

132
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Get out.

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,880
If you don't expose the queen's heart,

134
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
she won't die.

135
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
I didn't mean it.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Shut up.

137
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Don't think I don't know.

138
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
If the queen is overthrown,

139
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
you will have nothing to do with this world.

140
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
You don't want to.

141
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I will let everyone die.

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
I still failed.

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I couldn't destroy Yi Cheng.

144
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
So you left Yi Cheng.

145
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
You don't have to come back.

146
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
When I woke up,

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I was outside Yi Cheng.

148
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,880
They threw me out of Yi Cheng and abandoned me.

149
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I was so scared.

150
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
I was so scared.

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I was so scared.

152
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I was so scared.

153
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
I was so scared.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Yi Cheng abandoned me.

155
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
The way you wanted to break the rule

156
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
is not in my past.

157
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Maybe.

158
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Who is it?

159
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
It's you.

160
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
How many did you hear?

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I just passed by.

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I didn't hear anything.

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
I said,

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
you were so clever.

165
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I didn't hear much.

166
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
How many?

167
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
About...

168
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
From the beginning of Yi Wang Jian.

169
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
That's all?

170
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Miss Bai, help me.

171
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Young master Hu,

172
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
can you kill him?

173
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
No.

174
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I will kill him.

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Uncle Bai.

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
What's wrong?

177
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
The power is not good.

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I am your father.

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
I am Qi Feng Yao.

180
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
From now on,

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
we must be safe.

182
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
We will be safe.

183
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Father! Father!

184
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
No!

185
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
No.

186
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Master.

187
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Uncle.

188
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
No.

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
This girl is running fast.

190
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Listen to me.

191
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Why did she pull me out?

192
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
The most trusted person is Uncle Bai.

193
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Let her go.

194
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
What's wrong?

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Did you have a nightmare?

196
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I saw blood.

197
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
They all died.

198
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Who died?

199
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Master.

200
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Qi Feng.

201
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Master.

202
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Qi Feng?

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
There are many people I don't know.

204
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
But they all died.

205
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
The signs in the secret room

206
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
were all her relatives.

207
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
She suffered a lot that year.

208
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
She was in pain.

209
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
That's why she died today.

210
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Uncle Bai.

211
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I saw them all dying in front of me.

212
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I feel so bad.

213
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Why did I kill them?

214
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Why did I leave them alone?

215
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,880
They are all in your dreams.

216
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
It's over.

217
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Don't think about it.

218
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
In your dreams?

219
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Yes.

220
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
People in my dreams.

221
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Although they won't appear again,

222
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
they will protect you

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
in a place you can't see.

224
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Do you have people in your dreams?

225
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Yes.

226
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
They are always there.

227
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Not in my dreams.

228
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Do you have any dreams?

229
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Yes.

230
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
When I lost her,

231
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I thought I couldn't live anymore.

232
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,880
But when I saw her walk,

233
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I realized that

234
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
since we are alive,

235
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,880
we should live better.

236
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
For them,

237
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
and for ourselves.

238
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Thank you for your words.

239
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Do you think this line

240
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
is really related to our owner?

241
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Look at the owner.

242
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
I'll go out.

243
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Where?

244
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Yihuang Palace.

245
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
They have already sent the killer.

246
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
They won't show mercy to you.

247
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
That's good.

248
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I won't show mercy to them.

249
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
I dare to hurt the owner.

250
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I can't forgive them.

251
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Tian Hu.

252
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Tian Hu.

253
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Look at the owner.

254
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I found you.

255
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
You were hiding here.

256
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
You killed her.

257
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
You are doing this to free me.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
You are doing this to free me.

259
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
My mother is a emperor.

260
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
She is a real emperor.

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
You are not qualified to touch her.

262
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You are not supposed to come here late.

263
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Why?

264
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Is it because the owner of the backyard

265
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
is injured and busy with saving her life?

266
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Yicheng is always in a daze.

267
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Now he dares to go straight to the enemy.

268
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
It seems that there is a hill behind.

269
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
From the first demon to the city,

270
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,880
all these things are your secret.

271
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Tell me.

272
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,880
What is the plan between you and your back?

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
It's a plan.

274
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I won't tell you.

275
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I warned you before.

276
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Get out of here.

277
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Never come back.

278
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
I can keep your mother's life

279
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
for the last time.

280
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
As long as you promise to listen to me.

281
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
My life?

282
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
You said it's not a deal.

283
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Who killed the owner?

284
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Do you think you can beat me?

285
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Don't you forget where you got your spiritual power?

286
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
If my grandfather didn't send his spiritual power to you,

287
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
your throne would have been destroyed.

288
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Today, I will take back our family.

289
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Another one.

290
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,880
It's good that no one is leaving tonight.

291
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
My lady,

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
the king has already left the throne.

293
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Don't be so sad about the king's last love.

294
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Go.

295
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Stop acting.

296
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
You are so evil.

297
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
You even said that you are a man of your word.

298
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I don't care what you have.

299
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
You are a man of your word.

300
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
No matter what price you pay,

301
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I will kill you all.

302
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
You are wrong.

303
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,880
You are the one who caused the monster.

304
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,880
You even practiced the evil tricks with the bow of the underground palace?

305
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
You said I caused the monster.

306
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
What exactly happened?

307
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I will kill you.

308
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
You are the one who caused the monster.

309
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Huayou?

310
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
How could this be?

311
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I saw him in the inn before.

312
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
He was fine.

313
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
What did you do?

314
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
What did you do?

315
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Didn't you see it yourself?

316
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
It was the king's blood

317
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
that changed the crown prince's look.

318
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
These years,

319
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
if the king didn't raise the crown prince,

320
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
he would have been dead.

321
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I am sorry.

322
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
I am sorry.

323
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
I am sorry.

324
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
The king has been dead.

325
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
He has lost his mind.

326
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
He has become a monster.

327
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
How could he face you?

328
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Huayou is useless in the daytime and in the morning.

329
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,880
But when he falls asleep at night,

330
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
he will become a monster.

331
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
What exactly happened?

332
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
What does it have to do with me?

333
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
You forgot what you did.

334
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Seven years ago,

335
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,880
you entered the underground palace and destroyed the King's Sword.

336
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Sister.

337
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Sister.

338
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
You can't be like this again.

339
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Huayou has been attacked by the King of the Yi Dynasty.

340
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,880
He has also given you his own soul bone.

341
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
You have a more soul bone in your body.

342
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,880
You can break through the limit of one person's cultivation.

343
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
But Huayou,

344
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
because he has no soul bone,

345
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,880
he can't resist the anti-aircraft attack.

346
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
He has become a monster.

347
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Everything you have today

348
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
is all because of Huayou's life.

349
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Now,

350
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
you are going to die.

351
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
You are going to die.

352
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Now, there is only one way to save him.

353
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
What?

354
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Five years ago.

355
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
What do you want?

356
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
I want to say it out loud.

357
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,880
The Hall Master will never let you take away the truth.

358
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,880
I will never disobey his order.

359
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Yi Cheng has entered the spiritual realm.

360
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Fan Yuan is seriously injured.

361
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
He has no power to fight.

362
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Give me the truth.

363
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
I can let Fan Yuan live.

364
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Otherwise,

365
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
you all will die.

366
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
One is the Hall Master of the Nine-Ning Sect.

367
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
The other is the younger brother of the spiritual bone.

368
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Can't they both be more than

369
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
a white-haired monster?

370
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
They are both innocent and heavy.

371
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,880
You can choose the God of Fire.

372
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
The Hall Master

373
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Hall Master.

374
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Hall Master is asleep?

375
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Did your Hall Master always dream of you?

376
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
The Hall Master never sleeps.

377
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Of course, he wouldn't dream.

378
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
He never sleeps?

379
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Four words from the Demon King.

380
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
He doesn't allow him to relax.

381
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
The Demon King is killed in the wetland.

382
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
You will never understand

383
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
what our Hall Master has experienced.

384
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
You...

385
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Where did you go?

386
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Why are you staring at me?

387
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
If I say I want your life,

388
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
will you give it to me?

389
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Didn't I tell you to look after Yong'er?

390
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Why did he suddenly appear?

391
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I don't know.

392
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Maybe it's blood source.

393
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
The sister who dares to use the knife

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
is here.

395
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Or the threat of the King.

396
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,880
I didn't plan to let him know about Yong'er.

397
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Your Majesty,

398
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
you will know sooner or later.

399
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,880
What do you think he will choose?

400
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
No matter what.

401
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
As long as they want to make a new life,

402
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
they will come to Fenlan Bay.

403
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Tell Zhenyu that

404
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
after Fenlan Bay,

405
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
he will come to get the thing he wants.

406
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes.

407
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
The blood source has just been completed.

408
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
His Majesty is feeling better.

409
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Please rest well.

410
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
So,

411
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
you misunderstood Hua You.

412
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
How could a person who can protect his sister

413
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
with his life

414
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
betray his mother?

415
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Since you are loyal to Fan Yue and you are a burden to me,

416
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,880
why don't you just promise the King to take me to him?

417
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Because I don't want to.

418
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
You don't want to?

419
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm afraid the Heavenly Fire Demon Lord doesn't have such a deep intention.

420
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
The people in the Hall of Good Moon won't be like the Qu Manor in the forest.

421
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I don't believe in a solution to the difficulties of Yicheng.

422
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,880
You won't believe it either, right?

423
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I didn't expect that I would be able to hear you say this.

424
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
But I have something that I don't understand.

425
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
If the truth is that Hua Ling is trying to save Hua You,

426
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
then what he should do first

427
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
is to get the soul bone back from you.

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
But he didn't do that. Isn't that strange?

429
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
He didn't tell me much more.

430
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,880
But the current situation is not the same as it was back then.

431
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
There are too many secrets hidden in secret.

432
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
There is another problem.

433
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
If Hua Ling just wants to use the Five-Thousand-Year Stone,

434
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
she can take me away.

435
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Why would she have to make such a big circle?

436
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
If she doesn't sacrifice her soul power

437
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
and break the Immortal Mirror,

438
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I might be trapped in there forever.

439
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
She won't be able to use the Five-Thousand-Year Stone.

440
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Unless... unless in her plan,

441
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
there is a circle that must let us break the Immortal Mirror.

442
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
That's right.

443
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Hua Ling must have hidden other secrets.

444
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
The Stone...

445
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
The Iron...

446
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
What are you doing?

447
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Yun Er, you heard everything.

448
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Don't be afraid. I'm saving you.

449
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Saving me?

450
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
The Iron is a evil method?

451
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
What's wrong with me?

452
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Do you need to save me like this?

453
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Do you think that after everything is over,

454
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
I will tell you everything?

455
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I discovered that a few years ago,

456
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,880
I was suddenly thinking about some strange wild pictures.

457
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
You said that they were all dreams,

458
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
but they weren't.

459
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Right?

460
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Seven years ago, I blocked the Yi-King Sword for you.

461
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
But there was no proof of the rebellion.

462
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
You said that it wasn't because you gave me the spiritual medicine, right?

463
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
The monster of the Yi-King Sword appeared for seven years.

464
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
But I couldn't catch it in time.

465
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
And in these seven years,

466
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,880
the reason why I couldn't remember what happened in the night

467
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,880
was because I was the monster, right?

468
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Do you know what this means?

469
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
As long as you know,

470
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I will definitely save you.

471
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
But the Yi-King Sword is a evil method.

472
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
If the monster is discovered, the Yi-King Sword will die.

473
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Then the monster will die.

474
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
If the monster doesn't exist, who can return to Yi-King Sword?

475
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
What do you want to do?

476
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I have a great power.

477
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
The monster of the Yi-King Sword can be cast.

478
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
cast?

479
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
This area is very dangerous.

480
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
If I break the fairy's wish,

481
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
I will be able to make it.

482
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
It's really a very dangerous place.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
I really need to thank Fan Yue and Bai Shuo this time.

484
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
If they didn't break the fairy's wish,

485
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
I wouldn't be able to open this ancient barrier.

486
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Where is the barrier?

487
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I didn't see it.

488
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,880
The barrier's eye was closed under the fairy's tomb.

489
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,880
The stone-gathering pillar just helped me open the barrier.

490
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Once the barrier is opened,

491
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
the whole city will be covered.

492
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
The people outside can't come in.

493
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
The people inside can't get out.

494
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Then the fairy monster is in the city.

495
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Isn't it just that she is so stubborn and so stubborn?

496
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Then where is Chong Zhao?

497
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
The Young Lord doesn't care about her.

498
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I have given her the way to live.

499
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
She has to choose her own way to die.

500
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
That's not my fault.

501
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Why it started if she wanted to live?

502
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
When she was lost,

503
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
she was killed embarrassed by the evil.

504
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
But if you don't want to come into my room empty-handed,

505
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I am asking you professionally for the life worth more in.

506
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
So for that,

507
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
don't go out and stay a bit away.

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
So that is why you have a great deal of sorrow.

509
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Okay.

510
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Senior, what's wrong?

511
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Nothing. I always feel uneasy.

512
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
You were still lighting the lanterns at this late hour.

513
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
I prepared a soup for you.

514
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Thank you, Junior.

515
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Did you not reply to the sect leader?

516
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Did Lan Ling's work get too busy recently?

517
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Even if it's busy, Yi Cheng has done such a big thing.

518
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Master will never do anything.

519
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,880
I'll write another letter to him personally.

520
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,880
In the past thousand years,

521
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
you have been struggling and struggling with your own life.

522
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,880
You are a successor of Yi Cheng.

523
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Only you, the god, can be strong and have the power to defeat the evil.

524
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,880
You lead Yi people to stand up and fight for justice.

525
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
You use others' lives to help me become a god.

526
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
This is the way you choose.

527
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
The existence of Yi Cheng

528
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,880
has already taken Yi Wangjian away.

529
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
But I'm already old.

530
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I can't pull out Yi Wangjian anymore.

531
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I can't help him anymore.

532
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
If Yi Cheng returns,

533
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,880
where can Yi people go?

534
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
But this time,

535
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I can only let the cold power princess help me

536
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,880
and tell her how to become a god.

537
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Cold power princess?

538
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
She is the demon king.

539
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
If she can become a god,

540
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
why would she tell you and not herself?

541
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
I know she has a plan.

542
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
But I don't have any other choice.

543
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,880
You and Yi Cheng have no time.

544
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,880
The two of us are not as good as each other.

545
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Seven years ago, you appeared on the one side.

546
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
I stopped Wu Yan to protect you.

547
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I hid Yi Cheng.

548
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Seven years have passed.

549
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Your side is getting worse.

550
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
You have already risked your life.

551
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,880
I re-opened Wu Yan and created you as a god.

552
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Not only for Yi Cheng's people,

553
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
but also for saving you.

554
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
This is the only way to survive.

555
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
This is a evil way.

556
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The Heavens have their own rules.

557
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
They will be more powerful and powerful.

558
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
But if you don't do this,

559
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
you will die.

560
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Your death is the death of each person.

561
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
The demons are not bad.

562
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
They are demons.

563
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Then you should die.

564
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
What about sister?

565
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
She is the master of the school of death.

566
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Do you want to see her in trouble?

567
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Yong'er.

568
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Wait for another day.

569
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
After another day,

570
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,880
you will be fully recovered.

571
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
You can fully recover.

572
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Yi Cheng

573
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,880
can also be completely recovered.

574
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Where are the Immortal Lord and the Immortal God?

575
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Where are they going?

576
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
You are the demon.

577
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
I have already reminded you that Yi Cheng is dangerous.

578
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
But you can't stop him.

579
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
You can't leave now.

580
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
What do you mean?

581
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Nothing.

582
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I just want to tell you that

583
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Yi Cheng is dead now.

584
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
But

585
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I am a little reluctant to let you die.

586
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Or that sentence.

587
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
If you are willing to sacrifice your life to make me feel better,

588
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I can't help you.

589
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
You are blind.

590
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
You follow me.

591
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
If not because you left the inn at night,

592
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
and you want to protect you,

593
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
who has the power to do that?

594
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
You are really always in this demon's hands.

595
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,880
Since you work with Haoyue Hall,

596
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
you said you didn't want to enter the Demon Realm.

597
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
You didn't want to enter my cold power.

598
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
You didn't want to come to me.

599
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Is it because of Bai Shuo at Haoyue Hall?

600
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
So you are willing to join them?

601
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
I am a member of the Demon Realm.

602
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
I can't join the Demon Realm.

603
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Tomorrow is the night of the Fen Lan.

604
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I will definitely have the chance to enter the Demon Realm.

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
I must ask you clearly tonight.

606
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
And you said that you want to be the god.

607
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
But I caught the person at Haoyue Hall.

608
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
You don't have to be the god.

609
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,880
You are saying that I am the god?

610
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
I should call you the god of the fire?

611
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Or the queen of the Yi?

612
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Stop talking nonsense.

613
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,880
What's the reason that you are in the Yi City?

614
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Are you colluding with the Yi King?

615
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I am asking you.

616
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Oh, right.

617
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Don't think I don't know.

618
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,880
The Fan Yu is no longer the original Hall of the Moon.

619
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
You are so stupid.

620
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,880
You are the real master of the Demon Realm.

621
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Why do you have to die here with him?

622
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Speaking of the Demon Realm, you are so powerful.

623
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Why don't you consider joining the cold power?

624
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Joining the cold power?

625
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
You cold power workers are cold-blooded.

626
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,880
You will never understand the meaning of the Hall of the Moon.

627
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
I said that I will kill you if I see you again.

628
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
You can't kill me.

629
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
The plan of the Cold Power Palace is not over yet.

630
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
No matter what their conspiracy is, I will find out.

631
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
You are still so self-righteous.

632
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,880
You were so impulsive in Ning'an City.

633
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
You thought you could save your father.

634
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,880
But you can only see him die in front of you.

635
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Shut up.

636
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,880
You can't do anything when your father is dead.

637
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
You are so unwell.

638
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
You really make me feel happy.

639
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I told you to shut up.

640
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Actually, you should thank me for my mercy.

641
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I let you and your father face the last time.

642
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,880
He should have died in silence.

643
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
You are not going to let the Demon Lord sleep?

644
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,880
If you let him go, he will teach me a lesson.

645
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
You are so stupid.

646
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
You dare to take advantage of me?

647
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Your Majesty, I will kill you if you continue to talk nonsense.

648
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Do you think you can escape?

649
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
It's good to pull a bell before you die.

650
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Do you know he is the nephew of the Demon Lord?

651
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,880
Aren't you afraid that Changmei will be with the Nile Tribe to take you to the Cold Power?

652
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Exactly.

653
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Do you know that I...

654
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
If I am afraid of death, I won't be able to live until today.

655
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Think about whether you have a life or not.

656
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Miss Bai, talk to me.

657
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
You have a chance.

658
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
What are you doing here?

659
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Do you know what you have missed?

660
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
You have a chance.

661
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Miss Bai.

662
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
What happened?

663
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
What happened between you two?

664
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Why are you so angry?

665
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Miss Bai.

666
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I already knew about what happened just now.

667
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
I should have killed him just now.

668
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
He wouldn't have the chance to escape.

669
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Shu, have you killed anyone?

670
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,880
It's two things that kill people and really kill people.

671
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
It's more important that you kill them.

672
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
You can't kill them.

673
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
You can't kill them.

674
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,880
It's two things that kill people and really kill people.

675
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Moreover, you know that you have to escape from the cold power of his mouth.

676
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
So you won't kill him in that sight.

677
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Alright.

678
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Don't blame yourself.

679
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
You are not a ruthless person.

680
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
You are a living person.

681
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Thank you.

683
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
No.

684
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm fine.

685
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Are you really fine?

686
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Doctor, we can't lose this battle.

687
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
We won't lose.

688
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,880
The cold power of his mouth is really colluding with the artist.

689
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Tian Huo, did you see who that artist was just now?

690
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
He is not worse than me.

691
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
I suspected that he was Hualin at first,

692
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
but he didn't look like his physical appearance.

693
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Is it possible that it's Wu Zhao?

694
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Although Wu Zhao is a prince,

695
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
he is not that strong in spirit.

696
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
That's seven years ago.

697
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,880
What changes did they make in these seven years?

698
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,880
This Fen Lan Wan Yan is destined to be a red gate.

699
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
But no matter what,

700
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
the five-year-old painting must be achieved.

701
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,880
The three doors are new and must be obtained.

702
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,880
That means that this red gate is not allowed.

703
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
That's right.

704
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
It's not allowed.

705
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
It's so late, why did you come out alone?

706
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
What's the matter?

707
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
There are many people in the inn.

708
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I asked you to come out.

709
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,880
I wanted to ask if anything was out of Hualin's mouth tonight.

710
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I haven't got the time yet.

711
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
He has been saved.

712
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Who can save him from the Hall of Fame?

713
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
The one who saved him has the spiritual power.

714
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
It's the artist.

715
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I'm here tonight.

716
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
It's the artist?

717
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm in the city today.

718
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Although I haven't found any other people in the cold palace,

719
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,880
since the artist is bold enough to save him,

720
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
it means that there must be someone in the tribe

721
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
who is in the cold palace to help him.

722
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
The night is not easy tonight.

723
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I'll send you out now.

724
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
No.

725
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Shu, can you not be so stubborn?

726
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
I said that I don't need you to care about my business.

727
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
When can you understand that

728
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
I'm no longer the white-haired one in the Nian City?

729
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Brother and Sister,

730
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
don't fight anymore.

731
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I'll play the noodles for you.

732
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm off.

733
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Brother and Sister, don't fight anymore.

734
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
You give this to Sister Asu.

735
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
She likes to play this when she's young.

736
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Brother.

737
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Zhe, I—

738
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
It's late.

739
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Go back first.

740
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,780
Your majesty,

741
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,300
I need your information on 21st of June,

742
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,660
and 9 June for you.

743
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,080
It is an official officials' request

744
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,820
against 21st the Seventh year of the cold.

745
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,580
Right�

746
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,980
Li alluck

747
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,460
Tomorrow isief F无

748
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Before this, People don't want to be in the clinic again.

749
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,460
Just have a special images before we go torä

750
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:20,420
So, that's what's going on between,

751
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,740
saying control is General?

752
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,620
There's nothing different.

753
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,220
No matter what, Hualin can't think of anything.

754
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,220
General is my real friend.

755
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,320
He's just a prince.

756
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,620
A prince who's waiting for you to guess and to see.

757
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,520
Thank you for telling me that you're here.

758
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,420
I hope you can make progress.

759
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,520
I also want to thank you for giving me the medicine.

760
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,820
I hope I can improve my spiritual power.

761
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,120
General, you're too modest.

762
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,320
In terms of war, in terms of war, in terms of breaking the sword,

763
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,820
Hualin can't even be far from you.

764
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,220
He's born weak.

765
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,420
Meijia is sure to sacrifice his family and use his position.

766
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,120
It's because he's a royal bloodline.

767
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,620
If it's me, I won't be able to help.

768
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,620
I've known you for years.

769
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,820
Until tomorrow night, we'll both succeed.

770
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,820
The King of the Dead

771
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,820
You're not going to the banquet?

772
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,020
Uncle Tai, what are you doing here?

773
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,520
Don't think I don't know.

774
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,420
You said there's danger in the banquet.

775
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,520
You just want to lie to us and give up.

776
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,020
Then you'll go and get the third star, right?

777
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,620
That's right.

778
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,320
We're all representatives.

779
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Although we've been used by the court,

780
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,620
the gate outside the city is our identity.

781
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,220
Who dares to do anything to us?

782
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,420
That's right.

783
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,920
I've said everything I should.

784
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,120
Whether you believe me or not, you're all there.

785
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,220
Stop! How are you talking?

786
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,920
The situation in Yicheng is clear to the public.

787
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,920
From the beginning, this is no longer a simple matter.

788
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,720
If I hadn't broken the contract with the Hall of Fame,

789
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,620
would you still have a chance to stand here?

790
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,920
If we have a little bit of time, everyone of us will be in trouble.

791
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,520
The third star is on fire. The Hall of Fame is at its peak.

792
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,220
There's no chance to get it.

793
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,920
Why are you acting like this?

794
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
You can't see anyone!

795
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,020
That's right.

796
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,520
Don't be impulsive.

797
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,220
You can't see anyone.

798
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,520
I'm just trying to persuade you to see the reality.

799
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,820
The first star is dead, and it has nothing to do with me.

800
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,420
The reason I'm standing here and trying to tell you all this

801
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,820
is because I think you're all involved.

802
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,120
There are some loyal people, but they're also involved in this.

803
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,720
The path behind us,

804
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,020
you can just go wherever you want.

805
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,520
What are you doing?

806
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,020
What are you doing?

807
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,620
What are you doing?

808
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,220
What are you talking about?

809
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,620
What are you doing?

810
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,420
What are you doing?

811
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,420
Are those threads really going to trust us?

812
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,020
If they're afraid of death, they will.

813
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,620
If they're not afraid of death, they won't say anything.

814
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,620
The three pictures of the Five-Year-Teen Sword

815
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,320
have already been printed.

816
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,620
Now, there's only one left.

817
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,620
It's the three stars that I hold in my hand, Fire and Monster.

818
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,620
Hua Yong, stay here at the same time.

819
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,920
Where is this?

820
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,220
The Palace of the King of Yi.

821
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,020
It's also the place where the King of Yi is.

822
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,520
I'll try my best to get in when the Fire and Monster are done.

823
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,720
I'll go with you.

824
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,320
No, no.

825
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,820
The Palace of the King of Yi

826
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,820
The Palace of the King of Yi

827
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,820
The Palace of the King of Yi

828
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,820
The Palace of the King of Yi

829
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,820
The Palace of the King of Yi
