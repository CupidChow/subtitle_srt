1
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,660
I'm here to drop her off.

2
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:02,966
Thank you so much for bringing her back.

3
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:08,833
No one is more suitable to be her stepmother than you.

4
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,673
Khun Nueng.

5
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,313
I still love you.

6
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,913
Anueng loves you so much too.

7
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,126
Khun Nueng.

8
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,286
Will you marry me?

9
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,166
What are you doing?

10
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,593
You don't have to give me an answer right now.

11
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,806
I can wait.

12
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,740
I can answer you now.

13
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,606
I don't love you.

14
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,753
I never have.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,060
Because if I did, you wouldn't have to ask me to marry you for the second time.

16
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,870
I…

17
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,326
I thought it would be good for us.

18
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,713
I still love you.

19
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:37,713
Anueng loves you too.

20
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,473
We can be a family.

21
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,740
I never said that I want her to be my mother.

22
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,873
I also never wanted you to treat me as your daughter.

23
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,326
Can we go home now?

24
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,793
Ar-Nueng, please take me home.

25
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:12,953
Please excuse me.

26
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:15,700
Hold on.

27
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,553
Let's talk later.

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,593
It seems like we won't be able to talk it out today.

29
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:24,780
Let's go.

30
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,740
Ar-Nueng, you’re so cool.

31
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,006
About what?

32
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:59,473
You rejected my dad very firmly.

33
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,150
I don’t love him.

34
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,660
How can I marry him?

35
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,593
That's right.

36
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:12,006
The one you love is sitting right here.

37
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,246
Who said I love you?

38
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,446
It’s you who love me.

39
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,366
Whoa!

40
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,633
You love me way too much!

41
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:27,766
It can be seen from Mars.

42
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,780
You're just in denial.

43
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:36,850
Are you only good at saying 'I love you'

44
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:39,633
when we're in that moment?

45
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:45,006
Nueng, what are you talking about?

46
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,073
Don't you take this topic seriously? I just got proposed.

47
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,380
Nope.

48
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,686
You’re mine already.

49
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,886
How can I let you marry someone else?

50
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:07,246
Don’t you feel shy or embarrassed when you say such things?

51
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,180
Look at yourself.

52
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,740
What I did is not even close to what you did to me

53
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,700
You’re full of charm.

54
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,873
We’re in a different league.

55
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:26,553
I won’t give up.

56
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,140
I will fight back.

57
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:31,846
Nueng.

58
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,380
Ar-Nueng.

59
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,246
What are you doing?

60
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,446
I'm driving.

61
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,406
Your heart is racing, right?

62
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,113
Am I good at this?

63
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,193
Nueng, I’m telling you to stop.

64
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,766
Why?

65
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,513
What are you going to do?

66
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,953
Fine.

67
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,073
Ar-Nueng, what are you doing?

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,713
Ar-Nueng, I promise you that I won’t do it again.

69
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,366
I thought you had more guts.

70
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,513
Hello.

71
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,820
How come you came back with Khun Nueng?

72
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,673
Didn't you go with your dad?

73
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:54,326
Oh, I dropped by to talk to Chet, so Anueng asked to come back with me instead.

74
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,180
Nueng.

75
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,526
Call me if anything comes up.

76
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,406
Okay.

77
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,126
Please excuse me.

78
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,846
Goodbye.

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,820
Eh? Where’s your bag?

80
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,140
Dad will bring it back to me.

81
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:38,380
How was the trip with your dad?

82
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,020
I’m not close to that family. I felt so uncomfortable.

83
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,273
That’s why I didn’t want to stay any longer.

84
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,113
My god! You can’t say things like that again.

85
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,100
Other people will blame me for not teaching you manners.

86
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,140
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,286
I won’t go next time.

88
00:07:58,846 --> 00:07:59,420
Hm?

89
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:03,673
I mean I won’t say it again next time.

90
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,740
You are so stubborn.

91
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,993
It would be great if Khun Nueng married your dad so she could take care of you and make sure you’re under control.

92
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,566
This topic again?

93
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,340
I never want Ar-Nueng to be my stepmother.

94
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,926
Please excuse me.

95
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,620
Khun Nueng, you’re really something.

96
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:43,260
You got proposed to twice by the same man.

97
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:48,713
Tuo Lek, it's not the time to joke about this.

98
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,740
Chet is very stubborn.

99
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,553
I ruined his wedding before and he still didn’t learn his lesson.

100
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:57,846
What did you tell him?

101
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,780
I rejected him.

102
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,300
But it seems like he still doesn’t understand.

103
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,966
Why don’t you just tell him that you’re dating Anueng?

104
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,046
Cannot!

105
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,153
If she says that, Anueng’s family will be doomed!

106
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,326
Right?

107
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,580
Yes.

108
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,166
If Chet knows that I’m in a relationship with Anueng, he won’t be able to accept it.

109
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,206
Tuo Lek, do you remember Yui?

110
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,460
He made a big fuss about Yui.

111
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,326
If he knows the truth, he might die from a heart attack.

112
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,246
But it's the truth.

113
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:41,540
The outcome will be the same whether you tell him now or in five years.

114
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:44,446
You're right.

115
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,913
But some truths are hard to accept.

116
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:56,660
I don’t want Anueng to have a fight with her family, especially with her grandma.

117
00:09:57,193 --> 00:10:00,793
But you won’t let her face it alone anyway.

118
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:05,406
That's right.

119
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,233
But I’m just worried about her.

120
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,433
Anueng really cares about her grandma.

121
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:19,593
She won’t be able to handle it if she fights with her grandma.

122
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,633
I believe that you can get through this.

123
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,206
Mon and I are here to support you.

124
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,246
Thank you.

125
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,206
Cheers.

126
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:38,713
Happy Birthday, Ar-Nueng. You’re the one I love the most in this world.

127
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,113
Try squeezing the hand of this doll.

128
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,060
Happy Birthday! I love you, Ar-Nueng.

129
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,513
In case you miss me one day, you will have this doggie by your side.

130
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:08,380
I will always love you. From Anueng, who belongs to Ar-Nueng!

131
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,300
Hey, Dr. Wan.

132
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:30,220
Yes?

133
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,393
Have you heard about Amp?

134
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,126
About what?

135
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,780
About her new boyfriend.

136
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,420
I heard he’s 10 years younger than her.

137
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:45,046
Oh my god! A 10-year age gap? Will they make it?

138
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:50,910
That’s a huge age gap. They probably talk about completely different things.

139
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,100
Do you think their relationship will last?

140
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,100
Do they even speak the same language?

141
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:00,180
Amp isn't that young anymore.

142
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,153
I’m worried about her.

143
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,940
I’m afraid she might pass away first.

144
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
That's harsh.

145
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:12,600
I think love is about two people, and age doesn’t matter.

146
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,940
Dr. Wan, you’re so optimistic.

147
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,006
I’m not. But I think it’s none of our business.

148
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:25,020
We’re just outsiders. We probably don’t know all the details.

149
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:26,966
Isn’t that right?

150
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,380
We have a reservation at the omakase restaurant. Shall we go now?

151
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,540
Oh, right. I'm hungry.

152
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:35,073
Are you hungry?

153
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Oh, yes.

154
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:37,380
Dr. Wan, you can come with us.

155
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,460
You guys go ahead. I’ll follow shortly.

156
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,513
Okay, see you later then.

157
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,120
- See you at the restaurant.
- Okay.

158
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:45,766
- See you.
- See you, bye-bye.

159
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:56,433
Hey.

160
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,420
Don’t think too much about what they said.

161
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,206
About what?

162
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:05,646
Come on.

163
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,406
We've been friends for a long time.

164
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,273
You think I don’t know you.

165
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,606
You always act like you’re not interested in anyone.

166
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,913
But you do, right?

167
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:17,873
I know it.

168
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,513
What do you mean?

169
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,313
Other people might not know, but I’m not like other people.

170
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,233
It’s Anueng, right?

171
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:42,526
I knew it!

172
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:46,500
Hey, I’m so happy for you.

173
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,980
You finally found the one.

174
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,873
You’re so obvious.

175
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm leaving.

176
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,660
My poor friend.

177
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:18,433
Why did you suddenly ask me to come run with you?

178
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:21,206
I’m into marathon running these days.

179
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,273
You should also come out and get some fresh air to relieve stress.

180
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,100
Are you stressed?

181
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,086
About what?

182
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,646
I'm not stressed.

183
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:34,993
But if I do get stressed, there’s only one reason for that.

184
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,113
Don’t be stressed.

185
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:43,606
I can deal with it.

186
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,206
Let’s race.

187
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,513
Whoever reaches that intersection first wins.

188
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,593
I’m off!

189
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,380
Oh.

190
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,100
Ar-Nueng!

191
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,140
Why aren’t you coming?

192
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:11,166
I’ve almost completed one round already.

193
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,500
Can I take a break?

194
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm tired.

195
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,393
Why do you get tired so easily?

196
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,446
I guess that's how it is when you're old.

197
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:22,380
Whoa.

198
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:26,873
You’re not 30 yet, you don’t understand.

199
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,006
Once your back starts hurting, you’ll know what it feels like.

200
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:33,366
Next time, find someone else to run with. I won’t come anymore.

201
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,046
No.

202
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,993
I don’t want to run with anyone else.

203
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:41,606
You feel bad when I tease you, right?

204
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,393
I won't tease you anymore.

205
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,060
No.

206
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,340
Our age is different and so our bodies are not the same.

207
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:53,673
Even though our bodies are different, our hearts feel the same.

208
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,513
I won’t take you running next time.

209
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:58,406
Should we go to yoga instead?

210
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,246
No.

211
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,806
Yoga is fun.

212
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,046
Let's go back to drawing.

213
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,065
Do you understand the movie?

214
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:35,745
Do you want to talk instead?

215
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,158
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,305
You wanted to watch this movie.

217
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,371
We can watch it later.

218
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,371
Is it about Khun Nueng?

219
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:53,171
I don't know how to help my sister.

220
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:59,158
All of her problems seem too difficult.

221
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:03,118
Ours were hard too.

222
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,771
You can help her, but don’t stress yourself too much.

223
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:18,011
In the meantime, should I entertain you instead?

224
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:24,025
I want to know how you'll entertain me.

225
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:26,611
Um...

226
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,185
Well...

227
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:34,091
How about I take you to your favorite omakase restaurant?

228
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:37,745
Come on. I'm so bored of it.

229
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,198
How about...

230
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,318
The new restaurant that just opened. You said you wanted to go.

231
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:48,638
Is this the right time to ask me to eat when it is so late at night?

232
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:55,451
If you don’t want to eat food, what do you want to eat then?

233
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:59,318
What should we eat?

234
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:06,678
Should we cook something to eat together?

235
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,798
Khun Sam.

236
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:15,091
Where are you going?

237
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,358
If you want to eat...

238
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,838
Follow me upstairs.

239
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,291
Hey, that's Anueng.

240
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,705
Anueng!

241
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,425
You’re the one who created the podcast, right? I’m your fan.

242
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:38,971
Me too! Your voice is so cute, but you’re even cuter in real life.

243
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:40,425
Can I take a photo with you?

244
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,078
Thank you.

245
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:43,075
Just one pic.

246
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:44,905
Er... Well...

247
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,595
Just one pic.

248
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:46,185
Anueng!

249
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,091
Please, just one pic.

250
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:49,811
Please excuse us.

251
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:54,835
Come on, it's just one picture.

252
00:19:57,585 --> 00:19:58,905
Are you okay?

253
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,465
I'm okay.

254
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:05,851
But how did they know I created that podcast?

255
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,905
People have been looking at me since this morning. I feel so uncomfortable.

256
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:11,385
Look at this.

257
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,251
(The beautiful voice behind the podcast, Anueng Asavaniwet)

258
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:20,051
I intended not to reveal my face.

259
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,771
Why do they want to know?

260
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:26,291
Because your voice is beautiful.

261
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,998
It's okay. We'll help you.

262
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,051
Right, Yui?

263
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,158
Yes, we'll help you just like today.

264
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,225
Let's go.

265
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,038
Ar-Nueng.

266
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,798
What's wrong?

267
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,131
Did something happen?

268
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,571
Someone revealed that Anueng is the voice behind the podcast.

269
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,575
They also posted lots of her photos.

270
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,025
She’s famous now.

271
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:13,091
I’ll tell you about it later.

272
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,118
You two, get home safely.

273
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:16,905
Alright.

274
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,731
There're so many people.

275
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:29,438
I didn’t show my face, they should understand that I don’t want anyone to know.

276
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,025
They probably like and admire you.

277
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:40,505
My university life seems complicated now.

278
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,345
Your voice is beautiful and you’re good-looking.

279
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,291
That’s why your life is complicated.

280
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:57,371
Those people who want to take pictures with you, are they just fans or do they want to be more than that?

281
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,025
Ar-Nueng! This is not funny.

282
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:06,705
Eh? I’m not trying to be funny. I’m actually curious.

283
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,465
Since it’s so complicated,

284
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:15,158
should I ask Folk to be my fake boyfriend?

285
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:17,758
No, you can't.

286
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,425
That will make things more complicated.

287
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:22,558
Gosh!

288
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:25,865
Is there nothing I can do?

289
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:35,411
How about I reveal my girlfriend to everyone? That way, my dad will stop asking you to marry him too.

290
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:38,665
Kill two birds with one stone. Isn't this a great idea?

291
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:39,998
No!

292
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:44,238
It will be even worse if you do that. You shouldn’t do anything.

293
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:13,558
Whose car is this?

294
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,331
It's your car.

295
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:18,398
Huh?

296
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,731
I don't want a car.

297
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:26,798
Oh!

298
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:28,211
Why?

299
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,811
It’s convenient for you to go places.

300
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:33,891
But I don't know how to drive.

301
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:35,518
I'll teach you.

302
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,585
I don't want to drive.

303
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:42,905
Nueng, your father wants to give it to you. You should accept it.

304
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:45,611
Take it.

305
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:49,585
Alright.

306
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,665
But I’ll let Ar-Nueng teach me how to drive.

307
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:58,625
Please, Ar-Nueng.

308
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:04,825
If your dad wants to teach you, you should let him.

309
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,571
So you both can spend time together.

310
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:15,825
If she wants you to teach her, then let it be.

311
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:36,385
Fah was right.

312
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:38,945
Anueng only loves you.

313
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,265
I can’t compete with you.

314
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,051
It’s not hard to make her love you.

315
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:51,318
I told you already. You shouldn’t give her what she doesn’t want.

316
00:24:53,705 --> 00:25:01,425
Because you truly know her. That’s why you’re the most suitable person to be Anueng’s stepmother.

317
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:07,918
I just said it, but you never listen.

318
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:12,998
Don't use Anueng as an excuse.

319
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,878
It's impossible between us.

320
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:19,838
Why?

321
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:21,331
I don't understand.

322
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:24,318
We're perfect for each other.

323
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:28,025
And you also love and adore Anueng.

324
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,851
Is it because you already love someone?

325
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,291
It doesn’t matter whether I love someone or not.

326
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,305
What's more important is

327
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:52,678
I don't love you.

328
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,665
I never have.

329
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,705
I hope you understand.

330
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:15,256
Ar-Nueng, can I listen to something while driving?

331
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,336
How can you concentrate then?

332
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:21,762
But it’s too quiet. I’m about to lose my mind right now.

333
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,096
Okay, okay.

334
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:25,562
It’s your car anyway.

335
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:26,682
It’s entirely up to you.

336
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:30,909
Found it.

337
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:39,496
Whoa, he treats you like he doesn’t love you anymore.

338
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:43,802
I want to break up with him too. I’ve tried many times already.

339
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,669
But I always have a soft spot in my heart for him.

340
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:52,002
How do you put up with all that? If it were me, I wouldn't tolerate it, and I would have broken up with him a long time ago.

341
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:53,909
What is this station?

342
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:58,456
They don’t have anything else to talk about, that's why they're talking about other people instead?

343
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,162
Ar-Nueng, you’re talking like an old person.

344
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:03,256
What?

345
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,882
This station is a mega-hit.

346
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:08,829
The DJ will give advice to people who call them.

347
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:11,269
I want to be a DJ for this station.

348
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:16,256
So after graduation, your job will be to listen to other people’s lives?

349
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:19,496
Ar-Nueng! Why don’t you understand the new generation?

350
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:24,029
I think we should start driving now before you start complaining like an old auntie.

351
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:28,709
You’ve called me old twice already.

352
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,749
Why? Does it hurt your self-esteem?

353
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,349
Even if you were older than this, I’d still love you.

354
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:45,549
Are you ready?

355
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:47,802
I'm ready.

356
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,216
Slowly press the brake and then start the engine.

357
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:57,829
Do you remember which one goes forward and which one goes backward?

358
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,296
Forward is D.

359
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:02,989
Backward is R.

360
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:04,269
That's right.

361
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,362
Are you feeling confident?

362
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:09,362
Slowly.

363
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:18,856
Ready?

364
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,149
Okay.

365
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:31,282
Nueng!

366
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:34,802
Nueng, keep the steering wheel straight.

367
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:40,696
Nueng! This isn’t a game.

368
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:44,149
It’s just controlling the wheel and remembering which one goes forward and backward.

369
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:45,802
Why can't you do that?

370
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,736
Ar-Nueng, this is my first day driving.

371
00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:51,496
Of course, I’m going to make some mistakes.

372
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:53,936
Can’t you be more patient with me?

373
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:58,922
But when I first learned how to drive, I could do it on the first day. What makes it so hard?

374
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,282
I'm not as good at everything as you are.

375
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:04,336
Nueng, what are you doing?

376
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:04,756
Nueng!

377
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:05,962
Nueng!

378
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,976
Nueng, where are you going?

379
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,096
Nueng!

380
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:13,229
Nueng!

381
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:16,002
Come back here!

382
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:20,202
I'll count to three.

383
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,789
If you don’t come back, I’ll leave.

384
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:24,829
Nueng!

385
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:36,989
One!

386
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:39,469
Two!

387
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,522
Fine! I’ll make it up to you!

388
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:01,962
Nueng!

389
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:03,242
Nueng!

390
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:04,856
Get in the car.

391
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:05,962
No.

392
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:07,269
Nueng!

393
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:11,882
Where are you going? Your phone and wallet are still in the car.

394
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,162
Anywhere but here, where I won’t be yelled at by you.

395
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:17,909
Nueng.

396
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,096
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

397
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:30,736
What did you say? I couldn’t hear it properly.

398
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,789
I said I’m sorry.

399
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:41,469
I said sorry, and you forgive me so easily?

400
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:44,016
Because you never apologize to anyone.

401
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:48,549
You're mischievous

402
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:52,709
Are we good?

403
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,696
Can we go home now?

404
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:22,589
How did you trip in a way that your nail got ripped?

405
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:25,709
Oh, I tripped over a stone.

406
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,896
Usually, you’re not a clumsy person.

407
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:38,242
Exactly. Ar-Nueng, you have to be more careful next time so you won’t trip over a stone again.

408
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,362
Nueng!

409
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:42,696
You're being rude now.

410
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,389
It's okay.

411
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,522
Anueng is right.

412
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:51,629
Khun Nueng, you seem to adore Anueng very much.

413
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:53,856
I’m so happy to see that.

414
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:55,749
Indeed.

415
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,322
How's it going at the university?

416
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:04,856
I'm just wondering, is there anyone hitting on you?

417
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,762
There are a few, but I don’t care.

418
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,616
That's good.

419
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:16,349
But if you do have a boyfriend, you have to tell me so that we can get to know each other first.

420
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:18,442
Okay.

421
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:22,589
I hope it’s not that tomboy, Yui.

422
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:24,336
What?

423
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,762
No! You can’t!

424
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:29,336
I won't allow it.

425
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:33,416
She’s not a tomboy. She’s queer.

426
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:38,922
What's wrong with people these days? Is it a trend to like the same gender?

427
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:42,416
Just because you studied in an all-girls school before doesn’t mean you have to like girls.

428
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:43,976
Isn’t that right, Khun Nueng?

429
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:48,389
It’s their right to like whoever they want.

430
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:52,336
Besides, Anueng is a grownup now.

431
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:53,589
Khun Nueng!

432
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:56,229
Don't worry.

433
00:32:57,056 --> 00:32:58,856
Yui and I are just friends.

434
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:05,122
I knew it. My daughter is not like that.

435
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:05,989
Right.

436
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,536
Because I’m in a relationship

437
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,896
with…

438
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,749
Folk.

439
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:20,549
Folk?

440
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:23,282
So, Folk is really your boyfriend?

441
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:25,989
That’s right.

442
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,522
We’ve developed our relationship from friends to lovers.

443
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:32,082
Next week, he will go to take the driving test with me.

444
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,416
What were you thinking?

445
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:44,376
Why did you drag Folk into this?

446
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:49,762
You're so worried about this matter, aren't you? I'm just trying to help solve the problem.

447
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:51,429
But this is not right.

448
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,896
It’s like you’re playing with Folk’s feelings.

449
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:59,762
I already asked Folk, and he's willing to do it.

450
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:05,962
Besides, one day, dad and grandma will wonder why I never have a boyfriend.

451
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:09,682
And why are we always stuck together?

452
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:15,842
Plus, people at university will stay away from me if they know I'm Folk’s girlfriend.

453
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,069
But there must be another way.

454
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,656
What you did

455
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,749
is hurting Folk’s feelings.

456
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:28,629
What's the other way?

457
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:32,802
We will think of something.

458
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,709
But right now, you should break up with Folk first.

459
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,842
I like seeing you like this.

460
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:42,749
Like what?

461
00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:44,562
Well...

462
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,576
You seem to be...

463
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:52,682
Jealous.

464
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:55,936
Nueng!

465
00:34:58,242 --> 00:34:59,789
I'm serious.

466
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:02,962
Fine.

467
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,402
I agreed to what you said.

468
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,002
I'll talk to Folk as soon as possible.

469
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:09,869
Okay.

470
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,482
Go make it right.

471
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,669
Roger that!

472
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,629
By the way, were you jealous just now?

473
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,789
Good night!

474
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:47,378
I hope it’s not that tomboy, Yui.

475
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,218
What?

476
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:52,764
No! You can't!

477
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,244
I won't allow it.

478
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:57,578
What's wrong with people these days? Is it a trend to like the same gender?

479
00:35:57,924 --> 00:36:00,964
Just because you studied in an all-girls school before doesn’t mean you have to like girls.

480
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:03,458
About her new boyfriend.

481
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:07,071
I heard he’s 10 years younger than her.

482
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,538
That’s a huge age gap. They probably talk about completely different things.

483
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,284
Do you think their relationship will last?

484
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:18,564
If Chet knows that I’m in a relationship with Anueng, he won’t be able to accept it.

485
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,698
He made a big fuss about Yui.

486
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:23,351
If he knows the truth, he might die from a heart attack.

487
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,111
Ar-Nueng, you’re talking like an old person.

488
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:29,218
What?

489
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:24,208
(Are you free tomorrow? Can you come see me at my palace?)

490
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,348
Auntie Nim’s cooking is so good.

491
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,728
The taste is like authentic royal cuisine.

492
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,588
Eat a lot then.

493
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:28,551
Do you have a lot of work lately?

494
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,288
If you ask me, not really.

495
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,798
The one who has lots of work is over there, Wan Vi.

496
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:40,328
The other day, you asked me about health stuff, right?

497
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:40,728
Yes.

498
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,568
You can ask Wan Vi.

499
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:44,608
She's the best.

500
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:46,478
Oh, really?

501
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:51,788
Can I make an appointment for my parents to have a full-course health check-up?

502
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:55,088
You can make an appointment and I will take care of it.

503
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,108
Thank you so much.

504
00:38:57,248 --> 00:39:00,998
Actually, I want to ask for your advice.

505
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:01,168
Yes?

506
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:05,388
I want to start investing, but I don’t know where to begin.

507
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:09,648
Khun Nueng told me that you’re the expert in this field.

508
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:13,878
My family put most of our money into buying gold.

509
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:18,488
They’ve been doing it since the gold prices were not this high.

510
00:39:18,488 --> 00:39:20,048
That's great.

511
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:24,928
But I want to allocate my assets elsewhere.

512
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:28,678
I want a high return so I can retire.

513
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:36,388
You need to first answer yourself how much risk you can accept and what field you're interested in.

514
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:39,968
Because the more interested you are, the more time you'll spend on it.

515
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,108
I'm interested in crypto right now.

516
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,918
But I’m not sure how to manage all the risks.

517
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:49,718
I guess we'll have a long talk after this.

518
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,108
- Really?
- That's right.

519
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:53,588
This is great. I asked the right person.

520
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:58,118
There's a high risk, but if we do some research, there are also a lot of opportunities.

521
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,588
You can start with the basics first.

522
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:05,608
You need to study the market trends and the factors that cause prices to go up.

523
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:07,438
Nueng, are you bored?

524
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:11,838
Yeah.

525
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:15,948
I don’t know what they’re talking about.

526
00:40:16,558 --> 00:40:17,718
I don't understand.

527
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:22,328
Besides investing money, you have to invest your time in it too.

528
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:25,608
Oh, no. That's my problem.

529
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,928
I don't have a lot of time.

530
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,088
I have to go now.

531
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:32,678
I'm leaving too.

532
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:33,848
Bye.

533
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,548
Nueng!

534
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:49,168
Someone might see us.

535
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:51,758
I need to recharge my energy.

536
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:53,748
I'm so tired today.

537
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:55,478
What are you tired of?

538
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,128
It's the weekend today.

539
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,158
Because of you.

540
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:01,868
I don’t know why you have to invite so many people to your palace.

541
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:06,488
I invited all the adults to talk.

542
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:11,718
Ar-Nueng, is there something you want to tell me?

543
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:19,448
Ar-Nueng.

544
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:27,268
I'm 37 years old this year,

545
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,164
and you’re just 22.

546
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,308
When I turn 40,

547
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,638
you will be only 24.

548
00:41:42,528 --> 00:41:43,668
So what?

549
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,628
There’s a huge gap between us.

550
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:57,598
You didn’t really understand the conversation between your dad, Wan Vi, and me, right?

551
00:41:58,908 --> 00:42:01,008
The only person you could talk to was Folk.

552
00:42:02,238 --> 00:42:02,918
Is that right?

553
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:16,428
Our lifestyles are completely different.

554
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,048
There’s nothing that matches.

555
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,008
So what should I do?

556
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:30,838
I already love you.

557
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:35,668
Should I change my lifestyle?

558
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,428
Should I change my whole life?

559
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:42,668
I'm willing to do everything.

560
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,968
But I will not lose you.

561
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:54,428
As time goes by,

562
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:58,238
I will be the one who takes care of you.

563
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:03,798
No matter what happens,

564
00:43:05,558 --> 00:43:07,068
we will be together.

565
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:17,398
Should I keep reminding you every day that I love you?

566
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:24,108
Like I always have from the first day

567
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:27,278
until now.

568
00:43:36,718 --> 00:43:38,318
Ar-Nueng, you don't have to be afraid.

569
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:45,248
You're my dearest.

570
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:23,908
Khun Nueng!

571
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:36,998
How could you do this to my daughter?

572
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:38,768
You're a liar!

573
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:40,838
I talked to your mom.

574
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:43,708
She wants you to go and stay with her in the US.

575
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:50,871
Right now, the person who should be by my side the most is you, Ar-Nueng.

576
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:53,395
