1
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,330
Careful.

2
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,760
That's right! Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.

3
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,030
What's the matter?

4
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,490
Did you have fun talking to that pretty doctor?

5
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,440
Her name is Wan Viva.

6
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,610
Why did you have to talk so closely to each other?

7
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,750
Couldn't you guys stay apart?

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,600
Nueng, I think you're too drunk.

9
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,430
I'll take you upstairs and let you rest.

10
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,650
I'm not going anywhere.

11
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,800
You have to be mine.

12
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,720
Only mine.

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,770
Nueng.

14
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,970
Someone might see us.

15
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,950
You want to do this, right?

16
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,240
Khun Nueng!

17
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,800
What do you think you’re doing?

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,170
What do you mean?

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,790
Well...

20
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,570
It’s about appropriateness.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,720
This palace is my home.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,730
I can do whatever I want here. Other people shouldn’t have issues with that.

23
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,910
I’m sorry for being too nosy then.

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,890
But if your grandma were still here, she would probably be worried, just like I am.

25
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,710
What should I do to make everyone happy?

26
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,310
Auntie Nim, can you give me the answer?

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
I know you’re worried about me.

28
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,310
But Anueng is my happiness.

29
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,370
She’s my everything.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,110
Is this reason enough to make you more open-minded about this?

31
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,050
Anyway, I’ll be more careful from now on.

32
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,130
I don’t mind those who don’t understand.

33
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,920
It’s not that I don’t care about my family name.

34
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,090
But this is my life.

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,970
I’ve realized what is the most important thing in my life.

36
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
How are you, naughty?

37
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,370
Are you sober now?

38
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,830
I’m sorry for causing you trouble.

39
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,910
I didn't mean to.

40
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,440
It's okay.

41
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,200
Auntie Nim was just worried.

42
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,670
Worried?

43
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,360
Worried about what?

44
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,510
She’s worried that I might deceive someone younger.

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,000
She probably doesn’t know that you’re the one who got deceived by someone younger.

46
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,440
You’re so naughty!

47
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:46,610
Auntie Nim is worried that other people will talk about us in a bad way.

48
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,610
You don’t have to care about other people.

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,810
I know.

50
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,830
I don’t want to fight with you about this.

51
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,210
Sooner or later, people will know about us.

52
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,040
I just want you to be careful.

53
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,960
Sleep in your room these next couple of days, okay?

54
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,470
Please.

55
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,080
Please, my good girl.

56
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,520
Please.

57
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,610
Fine.

58
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,030
It’s because you’re acting so cute.

59
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,520
Hm? Who? I didn’t do that.

60
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,850
Well… Can I give you a full hug?

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,050
Nueng.

62
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,030
You caught me off guard.

63
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,520
If you hug me, I’ll give you a kiss on the cheek in return.

64
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,290
Thank you.

65
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,850
Let’s start eating. I’ll drop you off afterward.

66
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,590
Nueng, call me when you’re done. I’ll come pick you up.

67
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,330
Okay.

68
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,120
Please take care of her for me.

69
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,210
Okay.

70
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,549
Let's go! Let’s go to class.

71
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,540
What's wrong with her?

72
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,920
She’s unusually lively.

73
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,400
Let’s go.

74
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,150
Alright then, let's go with our deal.

75
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,750
Okay. Thank you so much.

76
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,630
Travel safe.

77
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,790
That's our big costumer. They’ve booked the gallery the whole year.

78
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,790
It’s because of you that my gallery is fully booked until next year.

79
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,970
It’s not a big deal for someone with connections like me.

80
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,690
You can repay me with a private class instead.

81
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,170
Why are you telling me this now? Should we get started?

82
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,130
I’m just kidding! You don’t have to do that.

83
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,390
But you do have to spill the tea.

84
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,370
About what?

85
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,010
About Mr. Chet! What’s going on between you two?

86
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,860
Why?

87
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,090
Didn’t you guys get back together?

88
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,050
Huh?

89
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,600
Oh my god.

90
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,440
You have no clue?

91
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,830
Khun Nueng!

92
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
Hey, you!

93
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,800
What?

94
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,710
Look at this.

95
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,030
(Old love rekindled between M.L. and her ex-groom-to-be, Chet Lertwattana)

96
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,200
Khun Nueng, stop biting your nails.

97
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,530
I did not.

98
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,610
You obviously did.

99
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,770
Are you worried about the news?

100
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,250
Tuo Lek.

101
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,390
Mon.

102
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,380
Do you think Anueng will see the news?

103
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,210
Ah, I see...

104
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,670
You’re not worried about the news, but you’re worried that your little girl will be upset.

105
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
Yeah.

106
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,930
Have you two ever had a fight?

107
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
Of course.

108
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,310
Every couple fights.

109
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,290
That's right.

110
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,920
Why?

111
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
Do you two fight often?

112
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,280
No.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,760
But there’s always something comes up that makes us feel uneasy.

114
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,250
When you two fight, what is it about?

115
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,360
When we first started flirting, Mon liked to ask about my status.

116
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,910
Wait. That’s not right.

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,080
Khun Sam, you wanted to break up with me back then.

118
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,690
Eh? How did we get to this topic?

119
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,290
When you two fight, do you feel sick of it or tired?

120
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,490
To be honest, we always feel bad every time we fight.

121
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,120
But once we talk it out, it helps us understand each other better.

122
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,530
I’m so good at making her forgive me.

123
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,200
Who told you that? You almost didn’t catch me at the airport.

124
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,600
You almost didn't make it.

125
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,510
But I did make it in time.

126
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,310
I guess you told your driver to drive slowly.

127
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,000
Khun Sam! How was I supposed to know you were driving after me?

128
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,430
Er…

129
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,680
What if we fight and I can’t reconcile with her?

130
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,120
I want to know what should I do next.

131
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,520
If verbal language doesn’t work, then try using another language instead.

132
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,310
You two sisters… I won’t talk to you guys anymore.

133
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,520
Oh.

134
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,770
Mon seems to be hungry.

135
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:21,963
Where’s Folk and Yui?

136
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,273
We’ve separated.

137
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:53,903
How were classes today?

138
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,333
I saw the news.

139
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,173
Oh, you saw that.

140
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,503
It's nothing.

141
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:08,023
I know that.

142
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,943
You don’t have to explain.

143
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,663
Eh? You’re not mad at me?

144
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:18,533
Why would I be mad at you?

145
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:21,423
I know you don’t have feelings for my dad.

146
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:24,853
You’re afraid that I would be mad at you?

147
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:32,373
I feel like there are so many issues these days.

148
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:37,443
I’m scared that you will be bored and tired of all this.

149
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:42,283
Come on, Ar-Nueng! I guess we might actually fight now.

150
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,653
How could I be bored of all this?

151
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:47,453
I don't know.

152
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,643
I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.

153
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:05,333
Ar-Nueng, are you afraid?

154
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:10,653
I’m afraid too.

155
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:17,803
I’m afraid that you won’t be in my life.

156
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:27,423
From now on, no matter what happens, let’s face it all together.

157
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,923
Can you please don't think about it anymore?

158
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:37,053
I won't.

159
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,263
How’s today? You’re not tired, right?

160
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:44,853
I’m so tired.

161
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:03,293
Ar-Nueng, is it possible to tell everyone that we’re together?

162
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:04,743
We can't.

163
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,503
If we do, your family will be ruined.

164
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:09,923
My family?

165
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,743
That's right.

166
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,893
Do you remember when Chet found out about Yui?

167
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,383
I don't care. He didn’t even raise me.

168
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,083
Nueng! Don’t say such things.

169
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,423
It’s the truth.

170
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,573
But I won't say it again.

171
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:33,413
What about your grandma?

172
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,703
I totally understand you.

173
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,453
You love your grandma, right?

174
00:16:56,413 --> 00:17:04,173
In the end, we have to consider the feelings of other people around us, especially our family.

175
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,323
Do you understand what I’m saying?

176
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:09,533
Yes, I understand.

177
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,932
It's unfortunate that Khun Nueng has already left.

178
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:30,933
She’s so busy these days.

179
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,583
I guess she must be.

180
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:40,843
I heard that you’re seeing a tomboy.

181
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,843
You mean who?

182
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,943
Your dad told me everything already.

183
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:52,693
If I remember correctly, her name is Yui.

184
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,573
Oh, Yui!

185
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,163
She's really nice.

186
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,343
So what?

187
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,703
She’s still a tomboy.

188
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,343
I don’t want you to be close to that kind of person.

189
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,343
What if...

190
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,343
What if I want to date Yui?

191
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,173
What are you saying?

192
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:23,623
You're a girl. How can a girl loves another girl? It’s unnatural.

193
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:28,903
Did you and her already decide to be together?

194
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,453
No!

195
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,583
I'm just asking.

196
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,463
You can’t do that.

197
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:41,103
Don’t make me feel sad about this again. Your mom already did that to me. I can’t handle it anymore.

198
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:46,693
Please do me a favor. I want you to focus on your studies and graduate first.

199
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:51,493
Don’t get into a relationship yet, whether it’s with a boy or a girl. Do you understand?

200
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,443
Promise me.

201
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:57,013
I promise.

202
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,653
Help me with the cooking.

203
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,503
Go wash this.

204
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,843
What's up?

205
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,863
Do you miss me?

206
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:36,723
Ar-Nueng.

207
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:40,573
How can you say something like this when we’re far apart? So unfair.

208
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,443
The farther apart we are, the more often we should talk like this.

209
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,983
What's wrong? Is there a reason why you're calling me?

210
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:52,613
Ar-Nueng, why is it so hard?

211
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,573
What's hard? Your university work?

212
00:19:56,803 --> 00:20:00,903
People around us. Can we not care about them?

213
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,973
I guess you had a conversation with your grandma, right?

214
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,293
What did you guys talk about?

215
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:10,693
Can you tell me?

216
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:15,813
My grandma won't let me get close to Yui. We can't even be friends.

217
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,703
How about I just move in with you?

218
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:23,453
You can’t.

219
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,023
Nueng, listen to me.

220
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:43,213
Imagine if we love each other, but no one can accept us compared to when we love each other and our family can accept it as well. Which one seems better?

221
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:47,373
Of course, I want everyone to accept us.

222
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:50,223
But will that day ever come?

223
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:51,843
It will.

224
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,533
But it might take time.

225
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,853
We're not in a hurry, are we?

226
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:05,923
Okay. I'll wait. I will wait with you.

227
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,053
I miss you so much.

228
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:13,763
I miss you too.

229
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,343
I love you so much.

230
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,243
Ar-Nueng!

231
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,363
The more you talk like this, the more I miss you.

232
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:31,863
I’m looking at your picture right now. Does this mean I miss you?

233
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,493
Excuse me.

234
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:00,303
I’m going to buy a car for my daughter. What do you think?

235
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:04,613
But Anueng doesn’t know how to drive.

236
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:08,923
I feel bad for letting you drive for her.

237
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,923
Don’t be. My palace is near.

238
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:17,803
Thank you.

239
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:24,423
I want to please my daughter. I also want to teach her how to drive. Isn’t it a good idea?

240
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:25,933
You want to please her?

241
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:31,563
Have you asked her whether she wants a car or not?

242
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,803
She doesn’t want a car?

243
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:45,863
I mean, instead of asking me, you should ask her directly.

244
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:47,723
You’re right.

245
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,733
But it won’t surprise her then.

246
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:56,063
Maybe Anueng don’t want surprises.

247
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:04,243
Maybe what she wants is understanding.

248
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:10,573
You speak well.

249
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:14,603
Here. Try this.

250
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:28,783
The reason you invited me to eat out is not to spread rumors that we're together, right?

251
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:39,603
I think you know that you shouldn’t cross the line.

252
00:23:40,423 --> 00:23:45,543
I let you into my life because you are Anueng’s father.

253
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,183
You're so fierce.

254
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:49,663
I already know that.

255
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,863
You’re so famous right now.

256
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:07,893
Famous? How?

257
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,783
Your podcast. I saw so many people were sharing it.

258
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:14,283
I saw that too. The views keep increasing.

259
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:20,103
Do you know that many people are searching for who’s the sweet voice behind the podcast?

260
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:24,063
Why would they do that?

261
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,653
Obviously, people want to know who has such a beautiful voice.

262
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:32,223
You’re exaggerating it. By the way, how do you know that people are searching for me?

263
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:39,723
Here, take a look. Many people send messages in the inbox.

264
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,683
Do you think people will know that it’s me?

265
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,683
Don’t worry. I already told the admin of the page not to tell anyone.

266
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,293
But since people are so good at searching, I think it won’t be long until they know.

267
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,563
Thanks for your help.

268
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:08,823
Why don't you like it? Isn’t it good that many people like you?

269
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,703
No, I don't want to be famous.

270
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,763
I don't like to meet people.

271
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:17,003
I see.

272
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:30,573
Can I ask you one thing?

273
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:33,123
You can ask me anything.

274
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:42,493
Between buying a car and accepting Anueng’s identity, which one will you choose?

275
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,293
Why can't I do both?

276
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:48,813
I still accept her as my child, no matter what.

277
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:50,933
That's not what I mean.

278
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:52,823
I mean...

279
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,253
You have to accept her for who she really is.

280
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,203
You said like you know something.

281
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:03,943
You can tell me directly.

282
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,573
This is just a scenario.

283
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:18,653
Suppose your daughter likes a girl, what will you do?

284
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:25,453
My daughter and Yui?!

285
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,273
No, it can’t be. I don’t want that.

286
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,783
Khun Nueng, I won’t let her be lesbian.

287
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:33,983
Calm down.

288
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,983
Your daughter and Yui are just friends.

289
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:45,333
But what if one day they become more than friends, what would you do?

290
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:51,003
I don't know.

291
00:26:57,523 --> 00:27:05,883
Instead of using money to win her heart, why don’t you try to be open-minded, accept who she is, and respect her choices?

292
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:14,863
Anueng seeks acceptance, understanding, and someone who will listen to her.

293
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:21,743
Those are the things that you and Piangfa have never given her.

294
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,103
Think about it.

295
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:28,723
I have to go now.

296
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:49,133
There’re so many people who like you. How long do I have to be your bodyguard?

297
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:50,023
For a long time.

298
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:53,123
No, I don't want to! I don’t want to get into trouble.

299
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:57,283
There's your dad and now there are those boys at the university. They're looking at me like they want to kill me.

300
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:58,973
And there’s my grandma too.

301
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,043
Your grandma?!

302
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:01,083
What did she say?

303
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:03,283
She doesn’t want me to be friend with a tomboy.

304
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:06,133
I’m not a tomboy, I’m queer!

305
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,243
I know. Don’t be mad.

306
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,163
Adults don’t understand that.

307
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,983
It’s a generation gap, I guess.

308
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:17,303
But I believe there’s a way to bridge that gap.

309
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:21,563
I have cousins. They love me, but we just can’t talk.

310
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:22,483
I know, right?

311
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:25,063
It would be great if we could find some middle ground.

312
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:29,723
Just thinking about it makes me tired. But it would be wonderful if we could all truly understand each other.

313
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:32,423
It might be tiring, but at least we should give it a try.

314
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,783
Because I’ve fallen in love already.

315
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:37,903
Love who?

316
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:40,743
Who do you love?

317
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:41,723
Hm?

318
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,623
PP BILLKIN!

319
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,123
What?

320
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:05,768
Auntie Nim.

321
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:14,848
Khun Anueng, Khun Nueng is not here today.

322
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:18,258
I know, but I'm not here to see her.

323
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:20,288
I'm here to see you.

324
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:38,268
Khun Anueng, you don't have to do all this. It’s more convenient to order delivery.

325
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,848
You can just call me Anueng.

326
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:45,228
I can't, there are rules in this house.

327
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,698
Okay, if that’s what you prefer.

328
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:56,698
About food delivery, I think there's a difference between cooking and ordering delivery.

329
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,458
Another thing is that Ar-Nueng’s cooking is so good.

330
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,308
I guess you must be the one who taught her that.

331
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:07,448
M.L. Khaekhai taught her, not me.

332
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,928
Ar-Nueng’s grandma was so lovely.

333
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:13,644
That’s right.

334
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,468
M.L. Khaekhai loved her so much.

335
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:18,788
Are you ready?

336
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:20,288
I'm ready.

337
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:26,728
Today’s menu is Massaman curry, Khun Nueng’s favorite dish.

338
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:37,128
Yes, and then you turn it.

339
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:39,828
Cut it in half.

340
00:30:40,311 --> 00:30:41,204
That's right.

341
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:47,118
And then cut it into three equal pieces.

342
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,028
Let me see your hand.

343
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:26,118
Let's continue.

344
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:39,708
That's right. You don't have to hold it up too high. Use your strength to crush it. Make sure it's all crushed.

345
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,868
That's right.

346
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:48,228
Are you okay?

347
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:55,718
It's okay.

348
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:01,798
You see? Nothing is scary.

349
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:06,188
If the oil is hot enough, it won’t splatter.

350
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:08,188
Try to flip it. Can you do it?

351
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:15,028
Do it slowly. Scoop it up and try to flip it slowly.

352
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,708
That's right.

353
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:24,378
Auntie Nim.

354
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:27,378
Do we have any special occasion today?

355
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:34,158
No, but there’s a new trainee chef coming today.

356
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:36,238
Trainee chef?

357
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:37,488
Yes.

358
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:41,288
You can come out.

359
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,848
What happened to your hand.

360
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,258
I got cut. It’s okay.

361
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:04,918
You made all this.

362
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,198
Yes, Khun Anueng cooked all this.

363
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,078
I just helped.

364
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,678
Let’s try and see how delicious it is.

365
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:41,388
How is it? It's not good?

366
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:46,928
Ar-Nueng! Can you eat it?

367
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:50,408
It’s so delicious.

368
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:55,268
How can it not be delicious when you put so much effort into it?

369
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:57,868
If that's the case, you have to eat a lot.

370
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:03,268
Is it hard to cook?

371
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:05,908
Not at all, easy-peasy.

372
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:11,988
I put so much effort into frying the fish. The oil almost splattered on me. It's good that I dodged it in time.

373
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:20,791
Is there anything you want to ask?

374
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,038
Well...

375
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,358
I want to know...

376
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:30,528
I want to know what people in this house don't like. What are the rules here?

377
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:34,228
I want to adjust myself accordingly.

378
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:38,398
No one here dislikes you.

379
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:41,268
That’s not true.

380
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,728
People here look at me strangely.

381
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:46,748
But I’m ready to change myself.

382
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:53,968
They're just not used to the fact that Khun Nueng brought you into this house.

383
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:58,311
They wonder what your status is in this house.

384
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:05,468
What did Ar-Nueng say?

385
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:12,888
Khun Nueng said she doesn't care if people gossip about her and Khun Anueng.

386
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:16,988
Wow.

387
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:22,638
She said that? That’s too harsh. That's not nice.

388
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:28,768
Auntie Nim.

389
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:33,728
I love Ar-Nueng.

390
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:43,128
I'm ready to do everything to make the people in the palace accept us.

391
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:50,148
It doesn’t matter how long it takes. I will continue to work on it.

392
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,838
I just want Ar-Nueng to be happy.

393
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:02,928
Let me do that.

394
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,718
Today, I peeled potatoes too.

395
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:28,798
Ar-Nueng, you have to eat a lot.

396
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:47,878
Ar-Nueng, why haven't you showered yet?

397
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:50,948
Go take a shower now.

398
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,888
I'll go soon.

399
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:56,358
Ar-Nueng.

400
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,608
Where are you planning to hold your birthday party?

401
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:02,838
Why?

402
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,158
Do you want me to organize one?

403
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:09,488
No, I'm just curious.

404
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,198
Is it because…

405
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:13,998
You have a surprise?

406
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,798
No! I won’t tell you.

407
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,228
If I tell you, then it’s not a surprise.

408
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:29,068
I think I will invite Tuo Lek and Mon to come here and eat dinner.

409
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:33,668
Oh! You’re not going to invite my dad and that pretty doctor?

410
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:37,758
Oh, right. I forgot.

411
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,968
No!

412
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:40,368
- Give it back.
- No!

413
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:43,508
I will invite her. You want me to ask her, don’t you?

414
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,798
I haven’t said anything.

415
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:55,318
And I haven’t called anyone.

416
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:58,808
Are you sure?

417
00:37:59,028 --> 00:37:59,948
Yes.

418
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:02,708
I don’t dare to displease you.

419
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,398
Can you tell me what your surprise is?

420
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:08,748
Hm?

421
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:13,408
Ar-Nueng.

422
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:29,998
Hello, Chet.

423
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,358
You want to ask me to hang out with your family?

424
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:44,878
Not just Khun Nueng. I want Anueng to get to know my family too.

425
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,748
Have you told your parents that you're inviting me?

426
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,158
Not yet. I haven’t told them.

427
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,908
I'm sure your parents must be so happy to see me.

428
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:04,878
I don’t think it will be that bad.

429
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:10,228
I ruined the wedding. They must be strange to still love me after what happened.

430
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:13,568
I want Anueng to come.

431
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:16,688
My parents want to get to know their granddaughter.

432
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:23,468
But I know Anueng definitely won’t go if you don’t come.

433
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:29,148
I don’t know anyone.

434
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:31,598
I don’t want to go.

435
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:33,998
You’ll get to know them now.

436
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,008
Please come, Khun Nueng.

437
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:42,188
Your birthday is coming soon. Take this chance to celebrate it at the beach.

438
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:47,718
No. You should go with your family. It won't be any fun if I go.

439
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:50,708
Let’s go, Anueng. We’ll be late.

440
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:52,148
Khun Nueng.

441
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,468
I want to be a part of my daughter’s life.

442
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:57,558
Please understand me.

443
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:13,328
Feel free to stuff yourself today!

444
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:18,588
- Chet, make sure to order everything that Anueng likes.
- What a great day! I finally met my granddaughter.

445
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:21,768
- Okay! I'll get it.
- Give it to Anueng.

446
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,518
- Eat a lot, Anueng.
- Here you go, my granddaughter.

447
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:27,678
Thank you.

448
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:30,038
Anueng, eat this too.

449
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:32,988
- BBQ is here!
- Oh, it's here.

450
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:36,958
- This one for you and this one for dad.
- Thank you, Chet.

451
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:41,728
Well done, son. Thank you, Chet.

452
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,478
- Anueng, I give you two!
- Anueng, eat a lot.

453
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:46,408
Great!

454
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:48,968
Mom! It's your song!

455
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,968
Oh, my song is up?

456
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:07,838
Nueng.

457
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:10,568
Give your father a chance.

458
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:17,398
If you want your family to accept your choices, I think this is a good start.

459
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:23,718
But it’s your birthday. I want to be with you.

460
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:27,168
I usually don't want to go.

461
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,868
But your dad loves you so much.

462
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:32,508
But I love you.

463
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,668
Can you please not be stubborn?

464
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,028
Ar-Nueng!

465
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:46,988
You know I’ll lose to you when you use that voice with me.

466
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:49,348
You're cheater.

467
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,848
Please. It’s only for one day.

468
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:55,508
It won’t be that long.

469
00:41:56,468 --> 00:42:03,128
How about this? After you come back, I’ll spoil you with everything you want.

470
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:06,278
Really?

471
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:07,388
Yes.

472
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:11,078
Here.

473
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:16,968
Fine, I’ll go.

474
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:21,728
But I really don’t want to.

475
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,958
I want to stay with you.

476
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:29,238
Please, it’s just one day and we’ll see each other again.

477
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:39,968
When I come back, you have to let me do everything I want.

478
00:42:40,478 --> 00:42:41,708
Everything you want.

479
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:07,688
It's so cute.

480
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:09,228
Thank you.

481
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,278
I’ll hang it on my phone.

482
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,908
Can I have a moment, please?

483
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:30,678
- Let's take a selfie together.
- Okay.

484
00:43:33,808 --> 00:43:35,628
Let's get a bit closer.

485
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:38,328
One, two, three!

486
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:41,328
One more. One, two, three!

487
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:42,628
Nice!

488
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:45,838
What do you think?

489
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:49,068
Wow! You're so handsome, Chet.

490
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:50,208
Isn't this cute, Anueng?

491
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:51,488
So cute.

492
00:43:54,038 --> 00:43:55,888
- Let's continue to sing.
- Let's sing.

493
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:10,008
Hey, I bought this for you.

494
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:13,248
Thank you.

495
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:30,528
It's not really my style.

496
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:32,908
Oh.

497
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:41,788
Ar-Nueng, come join me!

498
00:44:43,368 --> 00:44:45,888
You go ahead. I'll wait here.

499
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:52,118
What are you doing?

500
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:54,868
Nothing. I'm not going to do anything.

501
00:44:56,398 --> 00:44:58,838
Nueng. Nueng!

502
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,958
What's wrong? Are you not having fun?

503
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:44,988
It's not that bad.

504
00:45:45,478 --> 00:45:46,728
I'm just tired.

505
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,838
Should we go back now so you can take a rest?

506
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:08,438
(Happy Birthday Khun Nueng)

507
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:13,788
Happy Birthday to you.

508
00:46:13,908 --> 00:46:18,368
Happy Birthday to you.

509
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:24,158
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday.

510
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:29,638
Happy Birthday to you.

511
00:46:29,638 --> 00:46:33,168
Here we go. Khun Nueng, blow out the candles now.

512
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:35,408
Happy Birthday, Khun Nueng.

513
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:36,958
Happy Birthday.

514
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:40,038
Thank you so much, Tuo Lek. Mon.

515
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:41,798
Blow out the candles now.

516
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,571
Let's blow out the candles!

517
00:46:46,228 --> 00:46:49,728
Yay! Happy Birthday!

518
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:53,198
This cake is the best. You’ll like it.

519
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,728
Tuo Lek, you cut it. I’ll just eat.

520
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:59,588
This cake is so cute, Khun Nueng. It suits you.

521
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:04,668
Khun Nueng, you don't seem to be enjoying it.

522
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,318
I'm just worried about Anueng.

523
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:14,608
Are you worried, or are you just missing her?

524
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:18,748
Both.

525
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,588
You're so honest about it.

526
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:31,068
What’s up, Chet?

527
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:34,798
Khun Nueng, Anueng has disappeared. I've been searching everywhere, but I can't find her yet.

528
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:38,268
What? Where did she go?

529
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,048
I don't know either.

530
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:44,808
I'll be there soon.

531
00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:46,598
What happened?

532
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:49,748
Anueng has disappeared. Chet still can't find her.

533
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:52,288
Do you know where she might be?

534
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:57,088
I think I know.

535
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:58,948
Drive safely.

536
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:00,748
Tell me when you find her.

537
00:48:01,758 --> 00:48:02,568
I've gotta go now.

538
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,328
Why isn't she picking up the phone?

539
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,488
Pick up the phone, Anueng.

540
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:05,848
- Nueng.
- Ar-Nueng.

541
00:49:08,718 --> 00:49:10,288
How did you get here?

542
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:15,808
I used the key under the plant pot to unlock the door.

543
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:23,348
Why didn't you tell me?

544
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:36,938
It's because of you! It's your birthday, but you told me to be with someone else.

545
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:40,218
Nueng, that's not nice.

546
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:41,858
He's your dad.

547
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:47,868
But today is a special day. It's our first birthday together.

548
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:53,468
You didn't even call me.

549
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:59,258
I called you over 40 times, but you didn't pick up.

550
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,078
Oh.

551
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,608
I must have forgotten to check my phone.

552
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:10,738
Please don't do this anymore.

553
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:12,748
I beg you, please don't.

554
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:17,108
I won't allow you to go anywhere alone.

555
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:21,098
I was so worried about you, like I was going crazy.

556
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:23,608
I'm sorry.

557
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,018
Ar-Nueng.

558
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:37,368
Hm?

559
00:50:42,148 --> 00:50:45,698
I'm already a grownup. Don't worry about me.

560
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,118
I can actually use public transportation to go back to Bangkok by myself.

561
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:52,098
Nueng!

562
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:59,018
I couldn't contact you. I didn't know where you were.

563
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,778
I couldn't live without you.

564
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:05,658
I won't let you go anywhere. No more.

565
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:09,698
Don't disappear like that again.

566
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:13,788
Ar-Nueng.

567
00:51:16,388 --> 00:51:18,138
I'm so sorry.

568
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:21,448
Please, don't cry.

569
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:29,288
I promise you that I will not do this again.

570
00:51:38,488 --> 00:51:40,748
I'm glad that you're safe.

571
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:46,378
Don't you dare smile.

572
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,098
You're so naughty.

573
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,028
Why are you still smiling?

574
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:03,538
It hasn't been too long since I last saw you,

575
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:07,738
but I miss you so much.

576
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,068
I guess you love me so much.

577
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:16,858
That's right.

578
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:19,628
I love you.

579
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,258
My dear.

580
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:28,928
I might die from your sweetness.

581
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:32,547
You don't like it?

582
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:35,608
I like it.

583
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:49,618
Today is my birthday.

584
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:53,368
Can you wish me a happy birthday?

585
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:02,508
Close your eyes first.

586
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:08,408
Okay.

587
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:24,328
Close your eyes.

588
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,778
How can I close my eyes when you're like this?

589
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,378
Ar-Nueng.

590
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:36,778
Fine, I'll close my eyes.

591
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:40,388
My eyes are closed now.

592
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:51,308
This birthday, I wish you a lot of happiness.

593
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:56,268
I hope you won't be stuck in the sorrows of the past.

594
00:53:57,558 --> 00:54:03,598
Today, tomorrow, and in the days to come,

595
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:12,051
I'll be the one to tell you that you deserve all the happiness in the world.

596
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:13,948
Happy Birthday.

597
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:16,768
My love.

598
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:26,188
What did you call me?

599
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:28,658
I can say it only one time.

600
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:31,538
It won't be special if I say it too many times.

601
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:37,058
Do you love me?

602
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:38,578
Just a little bit.

603
00:54:38,628 --> 00:54:40,028
Nueng!

604
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:42,258
Do you love me?

605
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:46,148
Do you?

606
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,748
I love you so much.

607
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,898
Can't you see that?

608
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:57,458
Today is my birthday.

609
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:01,488
Where's my present?

610
00:55:02,788 --> 00:55:04,018
Close your eyes.

611
00:55:17,258 --> 00:55:20,068
I am your present.

612
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:11,588
Since you're my present,

613
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,698
you should do as I please.

614
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:42,328
What's the matter?

615
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,608
You like it?

616
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:47,068
Hm?

617
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:57,728
Just tell me if you like it.

618
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,088
Ar-Nueng.

619
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:06,248
I want...

620
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:09,828
What do you want?

621
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,788
I want you to bite me.

622
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:31,538
Don't hold it back.

623
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:36,228
If you feel it,

624
00:57:37,468 --> 00:57:39,018
just let it all out.

625
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:52,618
Ar-Nueng.

626
00:57:58,898 --> 00:57:59,888
Ar-Nueng.

627
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,108
That's right.

628
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:04,778
Good girl.

629
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:08,171
Ar-Nueng.

630
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,211
Ar-Nueng.

631
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:27,388
I'm here to drop her off.

632
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:31,808
Thank you for bringing her back.

633
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:37,708
No one is more suitable to be her mother than you.

634
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:42,528
Khun Nueng.

635
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:45,308
I still love you.

636
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:48,658
Ar-Nueng loves you too.

637
00:58:59,228 --> 00:58:59,928
Khun Nueng.

638
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,128
Will you marry me?

639
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:14,328
So after graduation, your job is to listen to other people's lives?

640
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:18,188
Ar-Nueng! Why don't you understand the new generation? You're complaining like an old auntie.

641
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:21,398
Is there anyone hitting on you?

642
00:59:21,398 --> 00:59:23,648
There are a few, but I don't care.

643
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,638
I hope it's not that tomboy, Yui.

644
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:29,548
No! You can't!

645
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:32,248
Khun Nueng, you're the most suitable person to be Anueng's stepmother.

646
00:59:32,408 --> 00:59:34,358
It's impossible between us.

647
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:35,708
Why not?

648
00:59:36,028 --> 00:59:37,688
Is it because you already love someone?

649
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:46,812
