[Subtitles Provided by TheGayestGay & Phoebe Rise]

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,240
Are you really worthy of me?

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No one will be more suitable for you than me.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Consider my social status … education … and wealth

5
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,000
Chet … you know you can't see the bride before the wedding ceremony.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You'll soon be standing beside her at the alter. Why are you so impatient?

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,720
I need to speak to Nueng.

8
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
Where are your manners?

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,000
How many times have I told you to behave better?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry … but Nueng has disappeared.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I knew she was going to cause trouble.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,480
I wanted to see how far she would go.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Chet! … Chet!

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
Wait Nueng!

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Being descended from royalty makes my life different from others.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,240
I just want to run away from it and live a normal life.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Nueng …

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,480
Shit … what do we do now?

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
[4 years later]

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was taught as a child that everyone was beneath me.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Since there is no one worthy of me in this world,

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,480
I don't plan on ever falling in love.

23
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,000
Miss Nueng.

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't you think we see each other too often?

25
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Seeing you for only a few hours a day isn't enough for me.

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you ready to pack up yet?

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll help you.

28
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
No need.

29
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Why are you mean to me?

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,480
Are you annoyed with me?

31
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Shouldn't you be going home to do your homework?

32
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,480
Why are you talking about boring homework?

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're boring.

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,480
Well … I wanted to find you because I was missing you,

35
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,000
But you only want to talk about boring homework.

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,480
What do you want me to talk about? You're a student.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
Can't you just talk about us?

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Maybe you can tell me that you love me.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
You need to go home now.

40
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
No!

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
If you have something to say, just say it.

42
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,000
If I tell you … you have to take it seriously.

43
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,000
And you must be responsible and help me.

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,720
Why am I responsible to help you?

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,480
OK … Just tell me what it is.

46
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm running away from home.

47
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Now you know … please let me stay at your place.

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
No way.

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Please, please, please, please, please, please … please … please

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
You're so stubborn.

51
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I won't go home.

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you don't let me stay with you, I will sleep in front of your apartment.

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Whatever.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
"Whatever" means I can stay with you right?

55
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey … you seriously need to stop bothering me. 

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's really annoying.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Miss Nueng.

58
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
If you annoy me too much I'll just move away.

59
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Time to go home.

60
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Anueng.

61
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,720
Did you get any exams results today?

62
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Your rent is due.

63
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll pay you tomorrow.

64
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
It's only 8,000 baht. Why can't you pay me today?

65
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I said I'll pay you tomorrow. You know I aways pay.

66
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Make sure you do. I don't want to have to chase you again.

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,480
This is the sixth month in a row you've had to borrow money to pay your rent.

68
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,000
I've just sold one of my paintings at a gallery.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,480
As soon as I get the money, I'll pay you back. You don't need to worry.

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not worried about the money.

71
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm worried that if something happens to me one day,

72
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,000
You won't have enough money to survive.

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, if something happens to you, I'll inherit all of your money.

74
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Nueng, I'm being serious.

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why don't you come and work at my company?

76
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll make sure you are paid well.

77
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,000
I couldn't handle being a salaried employee working for someone else.

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why not? I'm a salaried employee myself.

79
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
As soon as I get the money from the painting, I will repay you.

80
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't need you to repay me.

81
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
Just wait a minute Sam.

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Total owing is 72,000 baht.

83
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Did you really keep a record of the money I gave you?

84
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,000
I only borrowed it from you.

85
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Is 20,000 baht enough?

86
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
8,000 baht is enough.

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So … when will you move back home?

88
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm sorry Sam.

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She hung up on you again?

90
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You shouldn't keep giving her money.

91
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,240
If I don't loan her money, she won't be able to pay her rent.

92
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,240
If she can't afford her rent, she will have to move back home.

93
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,240
She wanted to be independent and become an artist.

94
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
She needs to learn.

95
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,480
If you don't give her any money, how long will she keep being stubborn?

96
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But Grandma … it's been 4 years since she moved out.

97
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
You can go now. I'm going to have a rest.

98
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh … 20,000 baht. Thank you Sam.

99
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why aren't you in bed yet?

100
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm studying Grandma.

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
See … I really am studying.

102
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know what will happen if you lie to your Grandmother.

103
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
As soon as you finish, go straight to bed.

104
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,480
Yes Grandma

105
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Aren't you getting out?

106
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's go Nueng.

107
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
If you are going to ask me to go and see Grandma,

108
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm telling you "no".

109
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,000
Nueng, that was a long time ago.

110
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,000
Have you forgotten about our sister?

111
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,000
Between me and Grandma, who is more to blame for her death?

112
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,480
Sam … I know you love both me and Grandma.

113
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,000
But don't try to make me go back.

114
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Wait a minute Miss Nueng.

115
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What?

116
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I looked for you at the market but I couldn't find you.

117
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You dressed up beautifully today.

118
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where did you go? Who were you with? Tell me now.

119
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't have to tell you. It's none of your business.

120
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you here?

121
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,000
I told you I've ran away from home.

122
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,480
If I don't come here, where else could I go?

123
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
How about your friend's house?

124
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,000
No, I might get caught and I need to be considerate of my friends' parents.

125
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Considerate of your friends' parents, but not considerate of me?

126
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,480
Why do I need to be considerate when we're so close?

127
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Hey … when did I become close to you?

128
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,720
When isn't important because we are close now.

129
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
(sigh)

130
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,000
Why do you like to imagine things?

131
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Aren't you ashamed?

132
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Fortune favours the bold.

133
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,480
I want to stay close to you.

134
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Ah … Miss Nueng.

135
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,000
What floor is your apartment on?

136
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What apartment number? Let's hurry.

137
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
Why did you stop?

138
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's hurry to your apartment.

139
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,480
I didn't say you could come up to my apartment.

140
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
You have to go home.

141
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,000
You said you would let me stay with you.

142
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,480
I said no such thing.

143
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,000
Before I told you I was running away you promised to help me.

144
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
You can't take your words back now.

145
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Hey … I don't have time for this.

146
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,000
I have to do some painting today.

147
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I also have to do a drawing … for school.

148
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,480
Do you want to hire me to draw for you?

149
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,000
No. I want you to teach me how to draw.

150
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
How can I teach you to draw in only one day?

151
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If I can teach you to draw well in just one day,

152
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
I'll open an art school and get rich.

153
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
 It's time for you to go home.

154
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
I won't go.

155
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
You're mean. 

156
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you don't teach me how to draw today,

157
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll stay her and just sit in front of your apartment.

158
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey … keep quiet.

159
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
If I teach you how to draw today,

160
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
You have to go home as soon as we finish.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OK.

162
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Come on. Which floor? Which apartment?

163
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
Hurry up. Which floor?

164
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,001
(sigh)

165
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,001
Which floor?

166
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Why are you so close to me?

167
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,000
I just … wanted to have a close look at the picture you are drawing.

168
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Why are you drawing a picture of me? I thought I was too annoying.

169
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
I've been drawing landscapes all day.

170
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
And there are no cats or dogs here for me to draw.

171
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Aww … I'm just as valuable as a cat or a dog?

172
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
Have you finished your drawing yet?

173
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes. I've finished.

174
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
How is it? Should I submit it now?

175
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,000
It's good.

176
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But if you don't want to study art,

177
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
I don't see the need to put in so much effort.

178
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's go.

179
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
Miss Nueng. Wait for me.

180
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You didn't wait for me. You're being mean to me again.

181
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,480
I didn't ask you to run after me.

182
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,000
And a young girl like you should be able to run without getting tired.

183
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
I too tired to carry this.

184
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is your punishment for making me run after you.

185
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I told you I didn't ask you to run after me.

186
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't understand you. Why are you always running after me?

187
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,480
I'm a girl. So what? What's the problem?

188
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,240
Do you really not understand, or are you just pretending?

189
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,480
First … I'm an adult.

190
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Second … you're still a student.

191
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Lastly … we are both women.

192
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
Is that clear enough?

193
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Does love have to have rules?

194
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Who decides what age gap is allowed?

195
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
Why can't women love each other?

196
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
Who get to decide what is wrong or right?

197
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So please tell me,

198
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,240
Why should I like a girl like you?

199
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you worthy of me?

200
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I love you.

201
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I love you Miss Nueng.

202
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
I know I'm not worthy of you now.

203
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But one day I will be worthy.

204
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I promise.

205
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You can order whatever you want.

206
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll pay for it.

207
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Aww … you're buying me this meal so I don't think you're mean, right?

208
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Too much talk. Just eat.

209
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I need to go to the toilet.

210
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Wait a moment.

211
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,240
Do you know him?

212
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No.

213
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,000
You called me. Did you want something?

214
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
No.

215
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm a candidate for the upcoming election, visiting the area.

216
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
Here is my card.

217
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Why are you staring at me?

218
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,000
What did you think of that candidate?

219
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Huh?

220
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Tell me what you think about him?

221
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Why did you take his business card?

222
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What does that have to do with you?

223
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It matters because I love you.

224
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
(sigh)

225
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
 You say the word "love" so easily.

226
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Aren't you embarrassed to talk like that?

227
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm not embarrassed.

228
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You're the only person I feel comfortable around.

229
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If you love someone and can't tell them, then its awkward.

230
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So you're just here to vent your frustrations?

231
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, I'm not.

232
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Anyway, I like that you're in a good mood now.

233
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,000
You seem to like everything about me?

234
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes, everything about you is cute.

235
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
You need to go home now.

236
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,000
You're so chaotic!

237
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't be difficult.

238
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't want to go home now.

239
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You promised me,

240
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If I taught you how to draw, you would go home.

241
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't want to go home. Please let me stay with you?

242
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Please, please, please.

243
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,480
What's the problem?

244
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,240
I'll take you home.

245
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,480
What are you looking at?

246
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,480
You really are the perfect person for me.

247
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
When I'm with you, I feel powerful.

248
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,000
Please don't cling to me, its too hot.

249
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But I want to stay like this forever.

250
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It makes me happy.

251
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But its too hot.

252
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Is there no one at home you can pester?

253
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,720
So you need to pester me?

254
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,240
What's wrong?

255
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,000
You just said you don't like me to be clingy.

256
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,480
Don't act like that.

257
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,480
Like what?

258
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't be sarcastic.

259
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,720
I'm not.

260
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,000
I really don't know how to act.

261
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
Tell me honestly,

262
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Is there really no one at home you can talk to?

263
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
What's wrong?

264
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,000
I … don't know how to answer.

265
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There's no one at home,

266
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
That I can talk with.

267
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Maybe its the age difference?

268
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,240
Are your parents very old?

269
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
I don't live with my parents.

270
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Where did you parents go?

271
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know.

272
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,480
Why are you quiet?

273
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,000
You're the one who asked about them.

274
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Are you feeling sad now?

275
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Its OK.

276
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,480
You can ask me.

277
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
Who do you live with?

278
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
I live with Grandma.

279
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,000
Living with your Grandma?

280
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,000
Just the two of you?

281
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes.

282
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Only me and Grandma.

283
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,240
And you want to run away from home and leave your Grandma all alone?

284
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,240
If your Grandma suddenly collapsed, who would help her?

285
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,720
You don't know anything.

286
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,000
You don't know what you are talking about.

287
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,000
Is your Grandma really strict?

288
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes.

289
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,000
And you ran away from home because you argued with Grandma?

290
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,480
Yes

291
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Why do you laugh? I'm being serious.

292
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm not laughing.

293
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I was just thinking about someone similar to you.

294
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
So what did you argue with Grandma about?

295
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
Grandma wasn't happy with my exam results.

296
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
So Grandma hit me.

297
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
How strong is an old lady?

298
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It won't hurt if she hits you.

299
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,720
I don't love you anymore.

300
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Ahh!

301
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What's wrong?

302
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,720
Does it hurt a lot?

303
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,240
You cried out in pain.

304
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What's wrong?

305
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Shit.

306
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This is my house, so I'll go straight in now.

307
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,480
Wait

308
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
What happened to your leg?

309
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
I fell over.

310
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That injury obviously isn't from a fall.

311
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,480
I have to go inside now.

312
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I expect you to get better results on your exams.

313
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,480
You know what I expect.

314
00:30:45,000 --> 00:31:00,000
