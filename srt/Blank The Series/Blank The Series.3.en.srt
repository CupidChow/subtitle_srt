2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,480
Nueng.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, it's you.

4
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,000
Why are you surprised?

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
Were you expecting someone else?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,720
No, I'm just I'm waiting for customers.

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,240
Maybe you were expecting your regular customer?

8
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,240
No… I wasn't waiting for her.

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,240
Give me a minute to collect my things.

10
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Or should we … wait here for your girl?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,480
So … how's things going with her?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ummm … she's gone.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Gone? Where to?

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
I don't know.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,240
But it worked out well.

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,000
I've finally got some peace and quiet.

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,480
OK … it's very peaceful now.

18
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm curious about something,

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,480
Why is she avoiding you now?

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,000
She thought you were my girlfriend.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,480
What? Why didn't you tell her I'm your sister?

22
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,720
She got mad at me,

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
and said she would give up on me.

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,000
So I ...

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,000
So you ...?

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,720
So, I told her if you give up so easily,

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
Then you're not worthy of me.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
Nueng, why did you say that to her?

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,240
Let's go.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So … you'll just give up this easily?

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Miss Nueng.

32
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,240
You shouldn't make promises to people if you can't keep them.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,240
Don't let me see your face again.

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,239
You're not worthy.

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Ahh .. Do we know each other?

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,000
We study at the same tutoring school.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,480
You opened the door into my face.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
I didn't see you there. I'm sorry.

39
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
It's OK. It was an accident.

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,000
Ahh … I remember you now.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can I sit with you?

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
OK sure.

43
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you … want to talk to me?

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Was your … nose broken?

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,480
Do you want compensation?

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
What's so funny?

47
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
You want compensation for your broken nose, right?

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
No …

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,480
I just ... want to be friends with you.

50
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
No you can't.

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,720
You were mean to her. She's probably heartbroken.

53
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
You know I don't like ... half-hearted people.

54
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,240
If you said that to me, I'd be very upset.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But what about me?

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm upset too.

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,000
She promised she'd prove herself worthy of me.

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
But in the end, she just gave up.

59
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,480
You're clearly in the wrong here.

60
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,000
You allowed her to believe that I was your girlfriend.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
And then you were so harsh to her.

62
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
You're cruel Nueng. She's just a young girl.

63
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,000
And she's also jealous.

64
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
I think it's good.

65
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
Now she's no longer pestering me.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I understand. But is that what you really want?

67
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,720
You're worried about Nueng, right?

68
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
You always know what I'm thinking. Are you telepathic?

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've noticed that you're worried about Nueng a lot lately.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's she done this time?

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Remember that girl I told you about?

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Nueng was really mean to her.

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
What did she do?

74
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Nueng told the girl that she isn't worthy of her.

75
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Wow … that's really harsh.

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When that girl saw me, she thought I was Nueng's girlfriend.

77
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
Girlfriend?

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes

79
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,000
And Nueng didn't explain that I wasn't, so they had an argument.

80
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,000
But actually … I'm exclusively your girlfriend.

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't talk to you if you distract me.

82
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So … did Nueng explain that you're her sister, not her girlfriend?

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,720
No, she didn't, and I've never seen Nueng acting like this before.

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nueng looks like …

85
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Looks like what?

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,480
Like she really does care about that girl.

87
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
It's hard to believe.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,000
I've never seen her care about anyone before. 

89
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes, I've noticed too.

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,480
She not acting like the Nueng we know.

91
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
But you don't have to worry about it.

92
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,000
I know that Nueng will figure it out.

93
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you Mon.

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
You're clearly in the wrong here.

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480
You allowed her to believe that I was your girlfriend.

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
And then you were so harsh to her.

97
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,000
You're cruel Nueng. 

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
[Nueng calling]

99
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
So you'll just give up this easily?

100
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,480
You shouldn't make promises to people if you can't keep them.

101
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
But …

102
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't let me see your face again.

103
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
You're not worthy.

104
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
Anueng.

105
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go to that new ice-cream shop.

106
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Are you crazy? Her Grandma will come and yell at us.

107
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,720
I remember last time her psycho Grandma yelled at us all.

108
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sorry Anueng … we'll go now.

109
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
OK … I understand.

110
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Anueng.

111
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Anueng.

112
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
Little devil.

113
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Look at me.

114
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you OK?

115
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm OK.

116
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Are you eating?

117
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,240
Yes.

118
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Are you sleeping well?

119
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm sleeping normally.

120
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,000
Then buy me a meal.

121
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Huh?

122
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Aren't you mad at me?

123
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,000
Why would I be mad?

124
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,240
You said you never wanted to see me again.

125
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,480
Buy me a meal and I won't be mad at you.

126
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
If you don't want to buy me a meal,

127
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Then buy this drawing instead.

128
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,240
Be my customer.

129
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,000
How could you draw me so well if I wasn't there?

130
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,000
It's not difficult to draw your face.

131
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You thought of me and then drew this picture?

132
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

133
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,000
So my face was stuck in your brain for the last 3 days?

134
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,000
Is this your way of making up with me?

135
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Why do I need to make up with you?

136
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I just don't like …

137
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
People who are not confident.

138
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,480
You promised that you'd be worthy of me.

139
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,000
But when you saw my younger sister drop me off in her car,

140
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,720
You made a scene and said you'd quit.

141
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,480
You shouldn't make promises that you can't keep.

142
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,000
That beautiful woman who drove the luxury car,

143
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,480
The one in the couple photo in your bedroom,

144
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,000
She's just your younger sister?

145
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes … she's my sister.

146
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,000
Your sister from the same parents?

147
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, my biological sister.

148
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,000
I thought I might end up heartbroken.

149
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No wonder you two looked so close.

150
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,240
So this means I cried for nothing. 

151
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
You were imagining things.

152
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm jealous … you're my girlfriend.

153
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,480
Delusional.

154
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,000
I couldn't sleep and my face looks like a panda now.

155
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You are responsible.

156
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You told me that you were sleeping well.

157
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What should I have said?

158
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,480
That I cried all night and couldn't sleep because I missed you so much?

159
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
I would lose all my self-esteem.

160
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,720
So … you found me so you could make up with me.

161
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,000
This must mean that you missed me a lot.

162
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I already told you I didn't make up with you.

163
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,480
I just was passing by, and decided to sell you the drawing.

164
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,000
Fine … this isn't us making up.

165
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,000
You're so stubborn.

166
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,000
OK, I'll buy the drawing.

167
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ooo … how much is it?

168
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Where's my money … please help me find it.

169
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I missed you a lot.

170
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
Hold my hand or I'll be mad.

171
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Fine. Be mad at me then.

172
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
Then I won't go and see you.

173
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,000
And you'll have to draw me again so we can make up.

174
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,000
Isn't that wasting time you could be making money?

175
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,240
Why wasn't I born earlier?

176
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,000
If I was born earlier,

177
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
I would have graduated university by now,

178
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
And would have earned a lot of money,

179
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,000
Like your younger sister.

180
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
Being all grown up doesn't mean you will be worthy of me.

181
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
Then how can I be worthy of you?

182
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,480
Well …

183
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Well … what?

184
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm not someone who will easily fall in love.

185
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,480
That's great. You can love only me.

186
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,000
Miss Nueng.

187
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why don't you have any friends?

188
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,480
My friends are afraid of grandma.

189
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
When I was younger,

190
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
Grandma would go on a rampage if my grades were bad.

191
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Grandma blamed my friends.

192
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,720
But its not their fault.

193
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
What's your grandma afraid of?

194
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
She's afraid that I'll end up like my mother.

195
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
Grandma said that my mother had bad friends.

196
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,720
Thank you for the drawing.

197
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
I'll look after it.

198
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Greetings.

199
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,480
Who are you?

200
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
She just asked me for directions.

201
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm not asking you.

202
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
I'm asking you. Who are you?

203
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm Anueng's friend.

204
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Anueng's friend?

205
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,000
A person of your age can't be Anueng's friend.

206
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
And one more thing.

207
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Anueng doesn't need any friends.

208
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I thought it was a boy drawing pictures to flirt with my granddaughter.

209
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But it was you all along.

210
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,000
A person like you is not worthy to be Anueng's friend.

211
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,000
Look at you. You're a nobody.

212
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,240
Don't let me catch you near my granddaughter again.

213
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Inside now.

214
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,480
Why did you get close to that stranger?

215
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
She dresses so poorly. She's a total nobody.

216
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
But Miss Nueng …

217
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,720
Miss Nueng? How did she get close to you?

218
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,720
Don't you remember what I taught you?

219
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,720
Do you want to end up like your mother?

220
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,480
You won't be going to tutoring school anymore.

221
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,720
Grandma

222
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
From tomorrow, I'll pick you up from school myself.

223
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
But ...

224
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
End of discussion.

225
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Anueng's academic results are very good.

226
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,480
She should be able to get into any university course she chooses.

227
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
Anueng is good at studying.

228
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,000
So she'll probably study medicine. Right, Anueng?

229
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,000
There are many options for her if she doesn't want to be a doctor.

230
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,480
Anueng should choose a field of study that she enjoys.

231
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,000
She will enjoy studying medicine, right Anueng?

232
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh … hello.

233
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Please excuse me.

234
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Sure.

235
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why didn't you tell your grandma you want to study communications?

236
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm afraid it will result in an argument.

237
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,480
I'll be back in a moment.

238
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Greetings teacher.

239
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,480
Long time, no see.

240
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,480
Hello Nueng.

241
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,000
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

242
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You almost didn't.

243
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,000
Hi Anueng. Where's your grandma?

244
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
She's just there.

245
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,000
Are you an alumnus of this school?

246
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,000
She was a model student, excelling academically and culturally.

247
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, you were a scholarship student then?

248
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,480
You must have had a tough life. But at least you did well at school.

249
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I must say you did dress well today.

250
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
A bit better than when I saw you last.

251
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,720
You are correct.

252
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,720
With my earnings, I couldn't afford this dress.

253
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,000
Luckily, you didn't need to buy it yourself.

254
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,480
Chet … Greetings.

255
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Greetings. Do you know me?

256
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,000
I definitely know you - a new generation politician.

257
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And son of the former Prime Minister.

258
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,480
I see you came together. Are you two back together now?

259
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,720
No … but I hope we are soon.

260
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,000
Nueng.

261
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,000
Lady Khaekai. Greetings.

262
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You know that woman?

263
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Of course. I know her well.

264
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This 'woman' has royal blood. She is my granddaughter.

265
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
Oh … granddaughter?

266
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,000
She is not someone you can refer to as "that woman".

267
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,480
You should address her properly.

268
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,480
I usually don't attend events like this, so people may not know me.

269
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Also ...

270
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
My grandma didn't teach me to be a show off.

271
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If you look carelessly, you might think I'm just a nobody.

272
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
Nonsense Nueng.

273
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,000
Who would dare to look down on you? My granddaughter is not a nobody.

274
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Grandma.

275
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you want to lie down for a minute?

276
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,720
No … I'm OK.

277
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
Let me help you.

278
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,480
How did you get Nueng to come with you tonight?

279
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Why does that girl's grandma hate you so much?

280
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
Anueng is such a good girl.

281
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Did she get grounded just because she was with you?

282
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
It was probably because I looked like a nobody.

283
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,240
Her grandma looked down you just because you were dressed casually?

284
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,240
People like her will always judge others simply by their outward appearance.

285
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,000
They always judge a book only by its cover?

286
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,000
I guess its because its what they see first.

287
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,000
It's stupid.

288
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Who cares if she doesn't like you?

289
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
It's entirely her problem.

290
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
That girl is in trouble because of me.

291
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You seem to care about Anueng a lot.

292
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,480
Not really.

293
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
I just feel it wasn't fair,

294
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,720
And also …

295
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
I was insulted.

296
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Let me help you.

297
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Please accompany me to the School Centenary event.

298
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
It's win-win for us both.

299
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,480
But I'm still envious of Anueng.

300
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,000
I've never seen Nueng go this far to help anyone before.

301
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,240
Even though Nueng felt insulted,

302
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,000
She was still willing to admit that she's Anueng's friend.

303
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
My Granddaughter was smart enough to come here tonight,

304
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,000
With you as her date.

305
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,000
Maybe you two will get back together again?

306
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That is what I am hoping.

307
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,720
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

308
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,000
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

309
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm more surprised that you're descended from royalty.

310
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,000
I've always known you're not an ordinary person.

311
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
This love is just perfect.

312
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,720
What love is that?

313
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,000
My love … my love for you.

314
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,240
Aren't you afraid that people will see us?

315
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,960
No … I just missed you.

316
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,000
And today … you are very beautiful.

317
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Did you miss me too?

318
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,720
Tell me please. Did you miss me?

319
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Don't make a fuss.

320
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,480
Tell me first. Did you miss me?

321
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
We need to go back and check on your grandma.

322
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,000
Maybe she has already passed out.

323
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
Come on.

324
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You go inside and check on your grandma.

325
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,480
But …

326
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
I need to talk to my grandma first.

327
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
What do you want to say to me?

328
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,480
You can dress well, I see.

329
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,009
I remember … how to dress appropriately.

330
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,240
It's good that you remember how a descendent of royalty should behave.

331
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
But to act like this all the time?

332
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,720
It's annoying … I can't do it.

333
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,000
If that is all you wanted, then I will excuse myself.

334
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Why are you forcing yourself to live a mundane life?

335
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,000
Remember your heritage.

336
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,480
But I want to forget.

337
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
And I'm not forcing anything.

338
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm going home.

339
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
But you only just got here.

340
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,240
I didn't want to come here in the first place.

341
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Please stay until grandma comes back.

342
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,480
If you want to go home, I'll take you.

343
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,239
Thank you for understanding me.

344
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,480
Greetings … Nueng.

345
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
Mum.

346
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
