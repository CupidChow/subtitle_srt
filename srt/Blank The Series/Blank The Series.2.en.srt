2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,000
 Who is he?

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,720
Miss Nueng, please don't ignore me.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,000
Why do you want to know?

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,480
I want to know because I'm your girlfriend.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why did a man leave your room early in the morning?

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
Miss Nueng.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey!

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,000
OK, I'll tell you. But stop whining.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,480
Who is he?

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,000
He's the man I almost married.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
My heart ...

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,480
Your heart?

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
My heart is broken.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,001
Hey.

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,480
You asked me who he was.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,000
Why should your heart be broken?

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
(sigh)

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,000
Please let me inside your apartment.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No! Who said you were allowed in here?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
You came here by yourself. Now you can leave by yourself.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,240
You need to go.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,479
Wait. I brought some snacks with me.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, why did that man leave your apartment early this morning?

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,000
Did he stay here last night? Why did you let him?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hey. Calm down.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He came this morning to meet me, but I told him to leave.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,000
So … you're not in a relationship with him?

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't touch anything.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I won't touch anything.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Did you do all of these pictures?

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes.

35
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,000
Come out and eat.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
Oui ('Yes' in French)

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,240
What shall we eat?

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
Maybe …

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
You brought the food remember?

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
How old do you think I am?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,480
26

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not that young.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,240
Hmmm.

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,480
28

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,000
Hmmm.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,480
You're trying to flatter me.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
Hmmm.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
You're 30, right?

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
36

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,960
Are you really that old?

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
That's the same age as my mother.

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
How old are you?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
21

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,480
I'm still 20.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,720
Why do you ask?

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
20?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Shouldn't you be in university now? 

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,480
I was very sick when I was young.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I used to swallow pills like they were lollies.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,480
So I started school three years late.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,000
So your mother must have had you when she was very young.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,000
Does talking about this make you upset?

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Actually, you're right.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,000
My mother had me when she was very young.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then she left, leaving me with Grandma.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm sorry to hear that.

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
My mother isn't dead.

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Oh

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,000
Grandma sent her to America to finish school.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,720
So I've lived with Grandma since I was born.

71
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Have you ever met your mother?

72
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,000
No. But she will call me occasionally.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Surely your mother could come back to visit you?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,480
Grandma insisted that she stays overseas.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
And not return because she would be an embarrassment to her.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's how Grandma thinks.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
My mother didn't want me to be born.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
She tried to get rid of me, but I was too strong.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why did you look at me like that?

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you … starting to fall for me?

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,480
You're the one who likes to imagine things.

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Finish your food and then go home.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Eat.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,480
What are you doing?

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Please let me hug you.

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey. Are you going to hug me forever?

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's uncomfortable. I can't breathe.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
OK. I'll let you go.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm going to work. Why are you following me?

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to come too.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Even if I say 'No', you'll just follow me anyway right?

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Definitely.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
If you want to come, then come.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are the cutest.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Hey!

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
(sigh)

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
(sigh)

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wow.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Are you going to display your painting here?

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come here.

101
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,000
Please keep your voice down. Don't disturb other people.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
OK.

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,000
Nueng.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Here's the painting that has been sold.

105
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,000
The price is as we discussed.

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll leave it with you.

107
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll take care of it.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,480
Hey … Be careful.

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Shhhhhhh.

110
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Miss Nueng, where are you going?

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wait for me.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, are we Siamese Twins?

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,278
What sort of twins?

114
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:25,000
Never mind. Will you sell that painting?

115
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
It's already been sold.

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
There are people waiting for my work.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wow, you're so awesome.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're my favourite artist.

119
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course. I'm no ordinary artist.

120
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,240
That means you're a 'Limited Edition'.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh … and you're still single.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Have you ever wondered why you haven't met your soulmate?

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When did I tell you I was single?

124
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
You didn't tell me … but I know.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Don't lie to me.

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not mistaken.

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
You really are single.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Miss Nueng.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, Stand still.

130
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
OK … I am still single.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, are you satisfied now?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm so relieved.

133
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,000
So, do you know why you are still single?

134
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Why?

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,240
Because you were waiting for me to come along.

136
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Now that we've met, you can't escape from me.

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
You're such trouble. We need to go back now.

138
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
Miss Nueng.

139
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
What's bothering you?

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Something is clearly bothering you today.

141
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,720
How so?

142
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,000
Well … you called me,

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You said you wanted to visit.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But you haven't said a word since you got here.

145
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,000
I missed you. Why can't I just come to visit?

146
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
You know you can visit any time.

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
But … are you sure there's nothing you want to talk about?

148
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
You can order blueberry pie from a cake shop.

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,000
Why do you bother to make it yourself?

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Buying it and making it with love are not the same thing.

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
I want to make it by myself for Mon.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ahhh.

153
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Ah-huh.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
One day when you are in love, you will understand.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
Let's keep going.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hey, no need to add sugar. It's already sweet enough.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,240
Nueng.

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
What are you two talking about?

159
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Was something funny?

160
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,000
You've arrived just in time.

161
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,000
Nueng was teasing me because we're together.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,000
She said we're so sweet we don't need to add sugar to the pie.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nueng, you are right.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Everything I see looks very sweet.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Am I right?

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Isn't she cute?

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's too sweet now.

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Where's Mon. Isn't she eating with us?

169
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,000
Mon left us to talk alone.

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,240
So tell me,

171
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,000
Why did you come and see me today?

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I suppose I should just say it.

173
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm wondering …

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do young people these days easily say "I love you"?

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,720
Has someone confessed their love to you?

176
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,000
Who was it? Do I know them?

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I thought you'd ask that.

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You don't know them.

179
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Just a kid who's been hanging around me.

180
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,000
Kid? How old?

181
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
20

182
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
 20?

183
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you going to compete with Mon and me?

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't say I'd have anything to do with the kid.

185
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
You need to be careful.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,480
The young ones these days are scary.

187
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,720
They might even be trying to scam you.

188
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,000
Wait … does he know that you're descended from royalty?

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,000
Sam, look at me. Who would believe me even if I told them?

190
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
No one knows.

191
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
But you have to be careful.

192
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,000
Are boys these days serious about relationships?

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They are so immature.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not a boy.

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
Too much?

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,000
Have I shocked you?

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Of course I'm shocked.

198
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you like women?

199
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey. I didn't say I liked that girl.

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you don't like her, why are you even worrying about this?

201
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,000
Sam, I don't want to talk about this anymore.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I need to go.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey!

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm not finished talking to you.

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,480
Am I being too nosey?

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please think about it carefully.

207
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,000
If you don't have any feelings for that girl, why are you worried?

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,240
I have to go.

209
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,480
If and when you want to talk to me about this, I'll be here to listen.

210
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Please let me hug you.

211
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,000
That means you're a 'Limited Edition".

212
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Have you ever wondered why you haven't met your soulmate?

213
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,273
Why?

214
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:41,000
Because you were waiting for me to come along.

215
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Now that we've met, you can't escape from me.

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,480
I love you.

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I love you, Miss Nueng.

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I know I'm not worthy of you today.

219
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,000
But one day I will be worthy.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
I promise.

221
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,240
Seriously, aren't you angry about what I did to you?

222
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
No, why should I be?

223
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,000
You should be furious.

224
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm really not angry.

225
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,000
And I'm very happy that I bumped into you.

226
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Is your memory so bad you just forget what I did?

227
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I see you're still as mean as ever.

228
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,240
I told you to stay away. Why did you come here?

229
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
That uniform looks familiar. Isn't it your old uniform?

230
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,000
You went to the same school as me?

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,744
Face looks like someone …

232
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,000
Very familiar.

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
Who are your parents? I might know them.

234
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
I doubt it. The world isn't that small.

235
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,240
You should speak politely to adults using the "ka" suffix.

236
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,000
I doubt it … ka.

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,240
The world isn't that small … ka.

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This girl lives with her Grandma.

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No need to ask her anything else.

240
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's take her out for a nice meal. I'll pay for you both.

241
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,240
Can I choose the restaurant?

242
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,720
Of course.

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,480
Have you known Miss Nueng for a long time?

244
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
… ka

245
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
Yes … for a long time.

246
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
We almost got married.

247
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, give me a minute.

248
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
What does he mean "almost married"?

249
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,000
I've already told you we nearly got married.

250
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Why are you acting like you didn't know?

251
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,000
I just realised that if you got to the point of getting married,

252
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,000
You must have been in a relationship with him.

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,240
Never.

254
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
But you must have had feelings for each other.

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why else would you almost get married?

256
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
Sometimes people get married for stupid reasons.

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But I didn't get married and I don't have feelings for anyone.

258
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes, he obviously wasn't worthy of you.

259
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
You've learned my slogan.

260
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Why were you going to marry that guy anyway?

261
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
His name is Mr Chet.

262
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Mr Chet

263
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,480
He drives an expensive car and dresses very well.

264
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,000
Mr Chet looks like he's very wealthy.

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He also seems to like you a lot.

266
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,720
Maybe I'm a good catch.

267
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
I agree.

268
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't like it when Mr Chet hangs around you.

269
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,000
That day he went up to your apartment …

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry, I have to go and take care of something.

271
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,240
OK … pay the bill first.

272
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
I've already taken care of it.

273
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you

274
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,000
I told you that I don't want to go back home.

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
It's raining heavily now. Why would you not go home?

276
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,000
Go home before you get stuck in a traffic jam.

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let me wait at your place until the rain stops.

278
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Please, please, please, please, please …

279
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can I hire you to draw a picture?

280
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,480
Just let me stay with you.

281
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Aren't you concerned your Grandma will be worried?

282
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
What's wrong with you?

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're so heavy. What have you been eating?

284
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Hey

285
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,720
Stop pretending. I know there's nothing wrong with you.

286
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
Get up now.

287
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,240
Get up!

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Go take a shower and change your clothes.

289
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't want you to catch a cold.

290
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,000
Go take a shower.

291
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,480
Are you mad at me?

292
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,000
We can talk about that later.

293
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,000
Don't touch my things while you're in there or I'll definitely be mad.

294
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Hurry up and get changed.

295
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,480
I don't want you to catch a cold.

296
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,480
OK

297
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,720
Give me your wet clothes.

298
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Why do you want them?

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Why do you not use the polite "ka" suffix?

300
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You forget all the time.

301
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You should use polite language because I'm older.

302
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,240
Why do you want my clothes … ka?

303
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,480
We need to dry them or you'll have to wear my clothes back home.

304
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
Then your Grandma will discipline you.

305
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Discipline?

306
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean yell at you.

307
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Aww … you mean she will only 'yell' at me?

308
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes … if Grandma saw these clothes, I'd be 'disciplined' for sure.

309
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
Why are you staring at me like that?

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Are you starting to be attracted to me?

311
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I was wondering why you need such thick glasses.

312
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,240
Well, I already told you. My mother tried to get rid of me.

313
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,480
It caused me to be born prematurely.

314
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's OK, you can ask.

315
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
… ka

316
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,000
What does that have to do with you having poor vision?

317
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,720
I was born before I was fully developed.

318
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,000
This caused my eyesight to be poor.

319
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,000
What's wrong. Why are you making that face?

320
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm just wondering …

321
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
How do you manage to keep smiling?

322
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
It's all in the past.

323
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I don't see why I should be sad about it.

324
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,480
Luckily my mother changed her mind and decided to keep me.

325
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,000
And she made it to hospital in time to save me.

326
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm alive - that is all that matters.

327
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But my eyes are short-sighted, so I need these thick glasses.

328
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What are you doing?

329
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,480
You haven't changed out of your wet clothes yet.

330
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

331
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,000
OK … I'll change.

332
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,480
Sit please.

333
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,480
Why am I sitting here?

334
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't you want me to draw a picture of you?

335
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,480
It's still raining, so I'll draw while we wait for it to stop.

336
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You have a pretty face.

337
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:05,000
Perhaps you should leave your glasses off.

338
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,480
No.

339
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,240
I want to be able to see you.

340
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Sit still.

341
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,240
If you're not still, I can't draw you.

342
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,480
Sit still.

343
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,240
[Grandma Calling]

344
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,480
Where have you been?

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,720
I haven't been anywhere Grandma.

346
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,480
I waited at the tutoring school for the rain to stop .

347
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,000
 The rain to stop? The rain to stop? The rain to stop?

348
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,720
Why do you lie to me?

349
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Next time it rains, take a taxi home.

350
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,480
Go and have a shower and then go to bed.

351
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Yes Grandma.

352
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,480
"Love has no reason. If you can find a reason, then its not love"

353
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,480
I brought you some snacks.

354
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
 How did you know I was hungry?

355
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I told you that I'm your girlfriend.

356
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I need to know these sort of things.

357
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Delusional again.

358
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If you sit there, where will my customers sit?

359
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,000
Do you have any customers?

360
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,480
… ka

361
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,719
If I can't sit here, where can I sit?

362
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,719
… ka

363
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,480
(sigh)

364
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,000
Just sit there.

365
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,240
What's the matter?

366
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,479
Nothing.

367
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,000
Ahhhhh.

368
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,000
Is it tasty?

369
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,720
My school's 100 year anniversary is happening soon.

370
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,480
Will you go to the event?

371
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,000
Is that school really 100 years old?

372
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,720
Please go with me.

373
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
Please, please, please, please …

374
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,000
No … you need to go with your Grandma.

375
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Oh … I forgot.

376
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
I'll take you home.

377
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,000
Is there something wrong?

378
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,000
No … now go inside.

379
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OK .. thank you.

380
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Hey … what are you doing?

381
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm just thanking you for bringing me home.

382
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You're a pest. Now go inside.

383
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,479
Which boy drew these for you?

384
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Not a boy. Just a friend from school.

385
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Liar!

386
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,000
What sort of friend would draw so many?

387
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,480
Tell me the truth Anueng. Who really drew them for you?

388
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,000
You're really stalking Anueng?

389
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,480
Speak up Anueng.

390
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Don't let me find out about this happening again.

391
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,000
Why were you stalking Anueng?

392
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,000
Do I need to answer that?

393
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,480
I attend the same tutoring school as her.

394
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
What's your name?

395
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Folk

396
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,000
Have you never been taught that following a woman like this is stalking?

397
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,000
Do you like her?

398
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,000
Why don't you answer?

399
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes … I like her.

400
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If you like her, then why not just tell her?

401
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,000
If you're shy, how will you compete for her attention?

402
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,480
Who do I have to compete with?

403
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,479
Someone who's more confident that you.

404
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't let me see you following Anueng again.

405
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
[Anueng calling]

406
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,720
Nueng, what's bothering you this time?

407
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,000
That girl had a boy stalking her.

408
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,000
Who's the boy? Did you report him to the police?

409
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Should I report him?

410
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You're acting strange. Why would you even be hesitating?

411
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,480
(sigh)

412
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know, Sam.

413
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,720
If I report him, it will blow the situation out of proportion.

414
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,480
I've already spoken to him and warned him to stay away from her.

415
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Did you tell your girl?

416
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
No. I only warned the boy to stay away from her.

417
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,000
You seem very worried.

418
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's very suspicious.

419
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,480
Never mind. I'll handle this myself.

420
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Are you going to go to the school's centenary celebration?

421
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Grandma wants …

422
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
No way.

423
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,480
But you should go.

424
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,000
So … do you want a dress just in case? I'll buy it for you. 

425
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
If you want to buy me a dress, then I won't object.

426
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Everything I wear looks amazing.

427
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So what else has happened between you and that girl?

428
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,000
Here's your dress.

429
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,479
And don't forget that I bought it for you.

430
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,720
I'm not going to the school centenary event.

431
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
I don't care if you go, just take the dress.

432
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Hmmm … I know saying this is definitely going to annoy you.

433
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,480
But … please move back home with us.

434
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,480
(sigh)

435
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm really annoyed.

436
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I know you mean well,

437
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,240
But wait until Grandma dies before you ask me again.

438
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Nueng.

439
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,480
Have a safe trip home so I won't worry, understand?

440
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,240
Bye Bye.

441
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Why are you waiting for me?

442
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I went to the market but I couldn't find you,

443
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,720
And you didn't answer your phone.

444
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,000
My battery is flat.

445
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Who was that woman?

446
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Why are you so close to her?

447
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's not anyone you know.

448
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
She looks very pretty.

449
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,480
And her car looks very expensive.

450
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
That girl has everything.

451
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,480
I could never hope to compete with her.

452
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,000
Why would you compete with her?

453
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You can't be compared to her.

454
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,000
I know that's true.

455
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,000
If I can't compete, I should give up.

456
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,240
Why are you giving up?

457
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,000
 Who was it who pursued me relentlessly to win my heart?

458
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,480
Where has the confident girl who pursued me gone?

459
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So you'll just give up this easily?

460
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
Miss Anueng.

461
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,000
You shouldn't make promises to people if you can't keep them.

462
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,240
Don't let me see your face again.

463
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
You're not worthy.

464
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:30,000
