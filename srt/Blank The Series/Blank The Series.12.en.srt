1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,160
Nueng.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,550
Nueng, you're going to be alright.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,710
Nueng.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,930
Nueng!

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,770
- Nueng, Nueng!
- You can't go inside.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,030
Nueng, Nueng!

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,990
You can’t go inside.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,480
I’m sorry, but you can’t go in.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,150
Please let me see her for just a few more seconds.

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,240
You’re not allowed to go inside. Please wait here.

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,150
This is her belonging.

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,830
Khun Nueng.

13
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,640
How's Anueng?

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,270
It’s because of you!

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,610
Anueng is about to go abroad.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,070
Why the hell did you call that nonsense radio station and bring up all those memories?

17
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,510
You want to tell the whole country about you and Anueng, huh?

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,840
You wanted my daughter to come see you.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Well, take a look at what you did!

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,440
She got hit by a car because of you.

21
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,000
Because of you!

22
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,310
Anueng and I, we love each other.

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Disgusting!

24
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,450
You're a woman.

25
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,670
My daughter is a woman too.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,400
How can you two love each other?

27
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,240
We all trusted you.

28
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,030
But you did this to us.

29
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,750
How could you do this?

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Stop acting like you’re a father who loves his daughter.

31
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,530
You’ve known Anueng as long as I have.

32
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,850
Everyone is forcing us to break up

33
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:32,330
just for their own sake without thinking about how much it will hurt her.

34
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,850
Stop talking nonsense.

35
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,520
You're just an outsider.

36
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,850
But I’m the outsider who Anueng loves the most.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,150
I don't know whether Anueng ever felt true happiness in her life or not.

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,190
When she was born,

39
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,690
her mother left her.

40
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,800
She has a father,

41
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,890
but it feels like she has none.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,960
She has to lie to everyone that she’s happy.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,550
She never has the freedom

44
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,880
because her grandma is afraid that she will follow her mom’s footsteps.

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,630
She tried to escape and came to see me.

46
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,470
Did you guys even realize the wound you have caused to your own daughter?

47
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,610
Khun Nueng, don’t blame it all on me.

48
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,520
This has nothing to do with what's happening right now.

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,130
My daughter is in this situation because of you.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,730
If you two didn’t meet, Anueng’s life wouldn’t be like this.

51
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,290
What did I do wrong?

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,250
I have never done anything wrong in my life.

53
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,210
Why can't we love each other?

54
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,290
Why?

55
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,470
Why do you have to go against our love?

56
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,390
Khun Nueng...

57
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,590
Since I was born,

58
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,590
I never felt true happiness

59
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,000
until I met Anueng.

60
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,230
I never thought I could love anyone.

61
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,040
But then Anueng came into my life.

62
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,880
She’s the only one who has made me feel this way.

63
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,960
How can you blame it all on me?

64
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,690
Why didn’t you two blame yourselves too?

65
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Huh?

66
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,550
I'm her everything.

67
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,810
And Anueng is my everything too.

68
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm begging you.

69
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,330
- Fah!
- Mom.

70
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,660
Fah, where’s Nueng?

71
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,650
Where is she? How is she doing?

72
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,660
The doctor hasn’t come out yet.

73
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,860
We still don’t know anything.

74
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,130
Nueng.

75
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,430
Nueng.

76
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,990
- Because of you!
- Please calm down.

77
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,220
Why did you come into my granddaughter’s life?

78
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,570
If anything happens to her, you have to take full responsibility!

79
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,150
Do you hear me? You have to be responsible for it!

80
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,620
- You have to be responsible for it!
- Mom, please stop.

81
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,580
Are you all relatives of Anueng?

82
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,660
I'm her father.

83
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,170
Her arm is broken and she has a head injury.

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,920
We still have to keep monitoring her condition.

85
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,890
But now she's safe.

86
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,140
It depends on her condition when she will regain consciousness.

87
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,680
Please excuse me.

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,540
Thank you.

89
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,220
She's safe now.

90
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,210
We're lucky that our daughter is safe.

91
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,090
My daughter is safe now. You should leave.

92
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,450
I won't let you come here again.

93
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,160
Go back first.

94
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,200
I’ll call you when Anueng wakes up.

95
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
I'll come to see you again.

113
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,610
Khun Nueng.

114
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,300
Hello, Fah.

115
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,330
How’s Anueng’s condition?

116
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,940
She hasn’t regained consciousness yet.

117
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,060
That’s not true.

118
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,900
You lie to me because don’t want me to go see her, right?

119
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,250
Why would I lie to you?

120
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,130
Everyone here is worried about her.

121
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,000
Why hasn’t she woken up yet?

122
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,650
But the doctor said she’s safe now.

123
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,180
The doctor said it’s the side effect from when she stopped breathing.

124
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,320
Khun Nueng.

125
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,460
If my daughter doesn’t wake up, what should I do?

126
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,080
She will wake up.

127
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,890
She will definitely wake up.

128
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,050
Since when has she become like this?

129
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
It’s been two days already, Khun Sam.

130
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,860
She won't leave her room, and she won’t eat anything either.

131
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,900
Okay, I will take care of it.

132
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,980
Please heat up the porridge for me.

133
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,930
Sure.

134
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,210
Thank you.

135
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,270
Khun Nueng.

136
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,790
Tuo Lek.

137
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,640
Why don’t you come and eat with me?

138
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,920
If you continue lying down like this, you might get sick.

139
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,306
Please let me help you take care of her.

140
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't waste your time.

141
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,493
It’s always just the two of us.

142
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,013
Having you here won't make a difference.
