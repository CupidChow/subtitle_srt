1
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,610
What are you still curious about?

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,250
Does this mean we’re together now?

3
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,570
Um...

4
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,450
You don’t have to answer me now.

5
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,940
Are you mad at me?

6
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,150
Who would be mad at you?

7
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,570
Don’t forget that I’m the one who understands you the most.

8
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,820
You’re so cute.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,750
This is like a dream already, being together.

10
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,550
From this day, can I move in with you?

11
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,860
You’re going to leave your grandma alone?

12
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,010
Hm?

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,700
Fine, I won’t move in then.

14
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,380
But can I come stay over sometime?

15
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,620
Even if I say no, you’ll come anyway, don’t you?

16
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,190
You have such tight lips.

17
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,700
I know you want to stay over every day.

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,890
That's true.

19
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,690
I...

20
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,390
Want.

21
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,470
Want.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,140
Want.

23
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,890
I want you to come here every day.

24
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,140
Let's sleep.

25
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,540
Don’t you feel tired?

26
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,500
Hello, Khun Nueng.

27
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,590
Hey, you’ve been gone for many days.

28
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,690
Have you finished your project yet?

29
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,010
Yes, it’s all done. Grandma, I’m sorry.

30
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,980
I have to thank you a lot. We’ve troubled you again.

31
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,670
It’s alright. Nueng did her project until late at night so I told her to stay over at my palace.

32
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,690
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you first.

33
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,100
It’s okay. Knowing that she’s with you makes me relieved.

34
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,500
Come on. Let’s go inside. I’ve prepared desserts for you today.

35
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,590
You should go inside now.

36
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,780
Nueng!

37
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,490
Don’t do that again.

38
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,550
Why? Can’t I do it just a bit?

39
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,086
Last night...

40
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:37,633
Nueng.

41
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,290
Go inside now.

42
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,130
I have exam tomorrow. Can I sleep over at Ar-Nueng's house one more night?

43
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,380
That's enough, Anueng. You’ve bothered her too much already.

44
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,450
But her palace is so close to my university. Also, I have to study until late tonight. I’m afraid that I will be late tomorrow.

45
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,700
Please, grandma.

46
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,230
If Khun Nueng has no problem with that, then I'm okay.

47
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,070
Sure, it's fine.

48
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,090
I feel relieved when she’s with you more than her friends. Please keep an eye on her for me.

49
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,170
Okay.

50
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,790
Thank you, Grandma.

51
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,220
You're cheeky, little one.

52
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,050
Just go.

53
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,500
Sweep the floor carefully. Make sure there’s no dust all over.

54
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,590
Clean thoroughly.

55
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,970
Auntie Nim, this is Anueng.

56
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,220
She is…

57
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,310
She’s Piangfa’s daughter. Piangfa is my friend.

58
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,260
Her university is close to here. She has exam early in the morning tomorrow, so I’m afraid she will be late.

59
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,050
Auntie Nim, please arrange a room for her.

60
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,330
Understood, Khun Nueng.

61
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,290
Nam, come help her with the bag.

62
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,870
Follow me.

63
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,530
This is the library.

64
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,670
I like to come here all the time.

65
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,060
You can read whatever you like.

66
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,340
Nueng.

67
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,060
I know what you’re going to say.

68
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,770
You know?

69
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,860
You’re not ready to let others know about us and you don’t want me to move in with you yet.

70
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,180
I understand.

71
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,450
But that doesn’t mean I’m not sad.

72
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,180
I know.

73
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,990
I don’t feel good about this either.

74
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,690
Don’t make me wait too long.

75
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,390
I want the whole world to know that you’re mine.

76
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:19,790
It is me who wants the whole world to know that you’re mine, only mine.

77
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,590
What about tonight? Why do you want us to sleep in separate rooms?

78
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,059
I’ll go to your room later.

79
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,530
Wow, there’re so many books.

80
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,900
Make sure you read all of them.

81
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,860
There’re so many for you to choose.

82
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,310
Whose room is this?

83
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,290
It’s Khun Sam’s room.

84
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,820
You can’t go in even if it’s not locked.

85
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,630
I do have manners. I won’t randomly go inside other people’s room.

86
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,990
What about this room?

87
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,060
That’s Khun Song’s room.

88
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,850
You have another sister?

89
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,610
Why have I never seen her?

90
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,830
Khun Song...

91
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,500
She passed away already.

92
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,180
Ar-Nueng…

93
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,050
I’m so sorry.

94
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,460
I didn’t mean to.

95
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,030
It’s okay. You didn’t know.

96
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,940
Khun Nueng, Anueng’s room is ready.

97
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,850
Alright.

98
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,190
Thank you, Auntie Nim.

99
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,660
You’re welcome. Please excuse me then.

100
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,190
I don't come here that often. Why won’t you let me stay with you?

101
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,860
You can't.

102
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,130
Why not?

103
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,620
Because you’re here as my guest.

104
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,980
But I’m not your guest.

105
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,690
I thought this place would be our safe zone.

106
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,190
You can think that this is your another private room.

107
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,090
You can do anything with this room.

108
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,900
I know what I want to do.

109
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,630
Here it is, the microphone I want.

110
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,020
Take a look which one you like.

111
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,770
Is there anything else you need?

112
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:40,690
Nope.

113
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,910
Khun Nueng!

114
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,690
Oh my god! What a coincidence. Is this destiny?

115
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,710
Well… you’re bringing your niece here to shop?

116
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,250
Anueng wants to start her own podcast, so we’re here to buy a microphone.

117
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,340
I see. I’ll stay tuned!

118
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,430
Thank you.

119
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,770
Er... I think I should go now. I have a meeting later.

120
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:24,190
I’m so happy to see you. And don’t forget. If you want to drink, call me.

121
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,590
Gotta go, bye!

122
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,830
See ya.

123
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,270
Nueng.

124
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,370
Nueng.

125
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,420
What’s wrong?

126
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,830
Ar-Nueng, you went out to drink with that pretty doctor again?

127
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,580
Why are you smiling?

128
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,390
I’m smiling for you.

129
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,340
You have a good memory.

130
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,010
Of course, I remember. She sent you kisses in front of me.

131
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,420
So what’s between you and her?

132
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,100
Well...

133
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,300
We went out not that long ago.

134
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,910
Ar-Nueng.

135
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,310
Why?

136
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,250
Are you jealous?

137
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,170
I’m being serious here.

138
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,770
Don’t be jealous.

139
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,060
Doctor Wan and I are just friends.

140
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,450
We hung out long time ago. Okay?

141
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,550
Whatever. I still don’t like the fact you are close to her more than me.

142
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,180
What should I do then?

143
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,300
Why are you bringing me here?

144
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,420
To do this.

145
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,740
How many times do I have to tell you?

146
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,100
That I love you.

147
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,050
Will you stop being sulky with me?

148
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,580
Hm?

149
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,710
Will you?

150
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,710
Hm?

151
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,850
Please forgive me.

152
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,050
Let's go.

153
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,950
Ar-Nueng, do you think she heard us?

154
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,170
I don’t know.

155
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,270
It's good if she heard us.

156
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,430
At least one person knows that you love me.

157
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,530
Actually, I want the whole world to know.

158
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,340
Should we go out and kiss so many people will see us?

159
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,470
You’re silly.

160
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,010
Who would do that?

161
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,260
I would.

162
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you afraid?

163
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,590
Take that!

164
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,850
Let’s go shopping.

165
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,410
I don’t want to.

166
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,450
Eh?

167
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,250
I can buy it online.

168
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,700
Let’s go back to your palace.

169
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
I want to do something else.

170
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,510
You can't.

171
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,980
Since we’re already here, you should finish buying it.

172
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,450
Let's go.

173
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,790
I won’t allow you to go drink with that pretty doctor anymore.

174
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,270
Um...

175
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,750
Okay.

176
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,070
Can we go now?

177
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,347
Can you pick one yet?

178
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,557
Not yet.

179
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,447
Just take your time.

180
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:20,767
Khun Song is so pretty.

181
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,637
No wonder she’s your sister.

182
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:31,627
Of course. All my family members are good-looking.

183
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:38,527
So, did Khun Song has the same personality as you?

184
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,647
Nah.

185
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:45,397
Not at all. We’re completely opposite.

186
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:51,067
Khun Song was a very cute sister.

187
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:57,047
She was calm and kind.

188
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:00,867
She’s the opposite of me.

189
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:07,467
Khun Song must really liked you if she had the change to meet you.

190
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,047
So, have you picked a book yet?

191
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,007
I can help you choose.

192
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,287
Let’s see.

193
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,707
Ar-Nueng, you look so cute wearing this pajama.

194
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,117
Stop it.

195
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,647
What are you reading?

196
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:04,607
This novel uses very beautiful language, but it's not very easy to understand.

197
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,107
Why are you frowning while reading a romance novel?

198
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,247
Because I don’t understand.

199
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,347
You have an exam tomorrow. Did you study already?

200
00:19:15,547 --> 00:19:18,527
Yes, I did. I understand everything already.

201
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:23,367
But this is what I don’t understand.

202
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:25,677
Ar-Nueng, do you understand this?

203
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:33,807
Gosh, you’re so…

204
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:35,807
What?

205
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:40,387
I’ve been reading, and it just opened to this page.

206
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,277
Right. I totally believe you.

207
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:48,077
You don’t want to read anything else instead?

208
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:51,387
Will people listen to you read this book on your podcast?

209
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:54,947
I think it’s a good idea because no one has talked about it yet.

210
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,007
But… Isn’t it too hard to understand?

211
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,367
How can it be hard?

212
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,957
Oh, I mean this part is quite hard.

213
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:13,787
“So I gently kissed those lips.”

214
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,347
Which part is it hard to understand?

215
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:22,237
I just can’t imagine what it will be like.

216
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,997
You can’t imagine it?

217
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,607
Ar-Nueng!

218
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:35,347
You’re distracting me. You should read it with me now.

219
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,957
You said it yourself that you can’t imagine it.

220
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:07,837
I have to go.

221
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:14,907
Bye-bye.

222
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,087
Nueng!

223
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,427
Wait.

224
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,267
Give me your hand.

225
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,947
I’m not a dog.

226
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,367
Just give me your hand.

227
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,267
When did you buy this?

228
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:05,927
You don’t have to know.

229
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:12,727
If I had known sooner that you’d be this cute when you love me, I wouldn't have waited so long.

230
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:16,447
Thank you.

231
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,557
I’m so happy.

232
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:23,787
You should go inside now

233
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,867
Khun Nueng, you should’ve invited Anueng as well.

234
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:53,597
She has exam today.

235
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,707
You know her timetable.

236
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,317
I’m happy to see you happy.

237
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,687
Is it that obvious?

238
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,687
I know because I’m your sister.

239
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:10,567
Not true. Khun Sam called the palace a few days ago.

240
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:16,347
Auntie Kim told her that Anueng was staying at your place, so she guessed that you guys must have reconciled already.

241
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:20,597
Come on, babe. Why did you tell her all that?

242
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:25,127
So… Is Anueng planning to move in?

243
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,247
No.

244
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,837
She’s just staying over sometimes.

245
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:35,427
She has an exam today that’s why she came.

246
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:43,247
Khun Nueng, is there something on your mind?

247
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:47,947
A few things.

248
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:57,117
I have questions in my head all the time about whether what I'm doing is the right thing or not.

249
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,437
Since Anueng came into my life,

250
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:05,987
my heart is…

251
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,900
She’s in a serious condition.

252
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:17,127
Khun Sam, this is not the time.

253
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:21,247
Does Anueng know about this?

254
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:27,447
She told me that we should focus only on our feelings.

255
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:29,727
But...

256
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,247
Anueng is right.

257
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,947
Our life is short.

258
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:39,107
You’ve finally found your own happiness. Why do you have to care about others?

259
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,887
Usually, you don’t really care about anything or anyone.

260
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,811
Guess who?

261
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,661
There’re just the two of us. Would could it be then?

262
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:12,451
Come on. This is no fun.

263
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,451
How was the exam?

264
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:17,931
Obviously, I aced it.

265
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,941
Wow. You’re amazing.

266
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,351
What are you doing?

267
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:29,771
I’m designing my gallery.

268
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:33,821
You’re going to open a gallery?! How come I didn’t know this?

269
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:39,431
I’m still not sure whether I should open it or not.

270
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,791
Eh? Why not?

271
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:46,661
I’m afraid that I will lose profit more than gain.

272
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,701
Does a person like you have to be afraid of losing profit?

273
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,581
You’re so rich.

274
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,661
Of course.

275
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,951
What's with being rich? It’s boring to just spend money lavishly.

276
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:05,871
Wow. You’re so cool.

277
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:14,541
Apart from opening the gallery, is there anything else you want to do?

278
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:16,871
Um...

279
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:24,701
Apart from the gallery, I want to sell paintings and do art workshops.

280
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:28,821
There you go. You’ve figured your way out already.

281
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,931
There’s no need to be stressed, you're my exceptional one.

282
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,691
You’re the best.

283
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:38,551
Whoa. You’re over-complimenting me now. I’m over the moon.

284
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,871
If you’re amazing, you should be praised a lot, right?

285
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:48,981
Ar-Nueng, how about opening a café in this corner?

286
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:52,341
Teenagers like to take photos at cafés these days.

287
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:57,191
I think that’s a good idea, very interesting.

288
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:01,461
What else? I want to hear your ideas.

289
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:05,861
I think this area is beautiful. Many people will come to take photos here.

290
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:12,061
But if you want it to look better, you should put my face here.

291
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,501
Oh, I have to feed you first. I forgot.

292
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:23,661
No.

293
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:24,701
Come on.

294
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:25,471
Nueng

295
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,091
I brought this for you.

296
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,111
Enough.

297
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,407
It's so yummy.

298
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:33,221
Are you chewing it?

299
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:34,621
Come on, start chewing.

300
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:56,291
I want to stay with you one more night.

301
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,171
Tomorrow is Saturday. What’s the reason for your sleepover then?

302
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,111
Club activities.

303
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:07,451
No! Don’t lie to your grandma. It will become a bad habit.

304
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,341
Ar-Nueng!

305
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,511
Go. Get inside.

306
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:13,061
Please tell your grandma I say hi.

307
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:14,861
Fine.

308
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:16,171
Why are you not going?

309
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,861
Go home safely.

310
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,251
Nueng.

311
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,101
Don’t do this again.

312
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,591
What will you do if your grandma sees us?

313
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,431
Alright.

314
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:34,151
Next time, I will finish kissing you in the car.

315
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,981
Why are you still here? Go.

316
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:13,101
Khun Song.

317
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,151
You're a genius.

318
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,911
Wow, superb.

319
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,181
Look!

320
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:42,131
Ar-Nueng is here to pick you up.

321
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:44,781
I have to go then.

322
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:45,791
Bye-bye.

323
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:53,621
Walk carefully. You might trip.

324
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,141
I’m not a kid anymore. You talk to me like I’m five years old.

325
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:08,371
Ar-Nueng, do you realize that there are so many people looking at you every time you come to pick me?

326
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:10,181
Do I have to know this?

327
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,861
I’m possessive of you!

328
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:19,191
Why do you have to be possessive?

329
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:21,231
I’m only looking at you.

330
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:26,231
Ar-Nueng.

331
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,501
Why?

332
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:30,461
You don’t like it when I’m being straightforward?

333
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:32,021
Ar-Nueng!

334
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:37,701
Are you shy?

335
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:39,351
The weather is hot.

336
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:42,981
So you’re really shy.

337
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,031
Let’s go home.

338
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,551
Didn’t you say that you’re going to read me a book today?

339
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,571
Let me check the engagement of my podcast first.

340
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:15,891
Oh.

341
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:24,091
Nueng, are you actually going to read that novel for your podcast?

342
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:31,221
Nope. I’m reading that book for you.

343
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,131
You only have old novels.

344
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,941
This one is a sapphic novel.

345
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,271
What’s that?

346
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:46,911
It’s a girls’ love novel.

347
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,551
Will you like it?

348
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,751
Oh, my!

349
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:04,611
There’re already 10,000 views for my latest clip.

350
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:08,191
You did well.

351
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,651
I’m great, aren’t I?

352
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,301
Khun Nueng, Mr. Chet is here.

353
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:26,911
Oh! Anueng, you’re here too. This is great.

354
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:30,431
I want to invite Khun Nueng to have a meal with my parents.

355
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,271
Anueng, let’s eat out with your grandpa and grandma.

356
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,211
I can’t go today.

357
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:37,941
I have an appointment with Khun Sam.

358
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:42,021
What about you, Anueng?

359
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:50,691
Well, I don’t know anyone. I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

360
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:56,331
It's okay. There’s always next time.

361
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:02,271
You’re reading this kind of novel?

362
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,501
That’s right. This one is so famous.

363
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:16,171
What kind of novel is this? Lesbian?

364
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:21,191
Hey! Your daughter is a grownup already. She can decide for herself what she wants to read.

365
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,590
But this is --

366
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:27,431
If you want to make an appointment with me, just call me first so you don’t have to waste your time.

367
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:29,871
Alright.

368
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:33,951
Please excuse me then.

369
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,931
Are you sure you don’t want to go?

370
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:05,071
Desserts from this shop are so good.

371
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:06,971
Try it.

372
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,191
I thought we would never meet.

373
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:14,311
Why?

374
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:23,131
Because Khun Nueng wouldn’t let me meet you. I don’t why she’s so possessive of you.

375
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:26,331
Tuo Lek!

376
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:30,331
Sorry, my mistake. You’re just being worried.

377
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,651
She means I’m worried about you.

378
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:38,861
So what’s going on between you two?

379
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,951
Your actions are quite obvious actually.

380
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:45,691
There’s nothing --

381
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:49,791
We’re together. But Ar-Nueng won’t let me tell anyone.

382
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,451
What are you saying?!

383
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:58,451
You told me that you never have secrets with you sister.

384
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,491
Just keep eating so you won't talk too much.

385
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:23,766
I think Anueng is a perfect match for Khun Nueng.

386
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,466
Why do you think that?

387
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,216
Why are you asking me that question?

388
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:34,456
She’s still a student. There’s so much more to experience.

389
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:40,686
Can’t you see that Anueng really loves Khun Nueng?

390
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:48,576
If there’s someone who might fall out of love first, I think it will be Khun Nueng.

391
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:50,686
I don’t think so.

392
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:54,146
There’s a big age gap between Anueng and Khun Nueng.

393
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:57,736
The world beyond graduation is vast.

394
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:07,106
Did I say something wrong?

395
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:13,426
Did you forget that our age gap is quite significant too?

396
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,846
Have you ever considered stopping loving me?

397
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,456
Khun Sam.

398
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:31,346
Answer me first. Have you ever considered stopping loving me? You will meet so many people in the future.

399
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,026
No, I definitely won't stop loving you.

400
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:42,646
You see, I won't be mistaken. Do you know why?

401
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:51,906
Because when Anueng looks at Khun Nueng, it’s the same as when you look at me.

402
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:27,656
Khun Song.

403
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,096
If I hadn’t left this palace,

404
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:46,986
Khun Song probably…

405
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:07,096
Ar-Nueng.

406
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,466
What’s wrong?

407
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:25,266
Can you tell me about it?

408
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,326
You don’t have to pretend to be strong in front of me.

409
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,426
I can do that?

410
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:45,726
Of course.

411
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:51,696
We’re lovers now. We have to go through thick and thin together.

412
00:39:54,576 --> 00:40:02,536
If you have me here but still feel alone in this world, why would you keep me beside you then?

413
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,146
Let me be your shoulder to lean on.

414
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:29,226
Nueng, I’m not as good a person as you think I am.

415
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:34,936
I left all the burden to my sisters.

416
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:37,366
I placed it all on Khun Song.

417
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:43,816
Even though I knew it would be too much for her.

418
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,466
What about your feelings?

419
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:57,136
Leaving the palace was hard for you. You couldn’t bear it as well.

420
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,456
Khun Song probably didn’t want to see you like this.

421
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:14,726
If she was kind like what you told me, then she would want to see you happy.

422
00:41:34,816 --> 00:41:37,806
You almost weren't born because of me.

423
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:44,496
I didn’t know what I was thinking.

424
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:51,496
Both you and Khun Song…

425
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:57,966
I keep making mistakes, over and over again.

426
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,606
I’m sorry.

427
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:04,896
I'm perfectly fine.

428
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:15,226
You might not be able to give yourself today.

429
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:21,056
But I believe that you will get better.

430
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:31,736
I will always be here, beside you.

431
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,646
I will not go anywhere.

432
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,706
Can you please forgive yourself?

433
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:04,706
I’m sorry.

434
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,846
I love you, Nueng.
♫ I don't want to shed tears ♫

435
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:10,186
♫ I don't want to shed tears ♫

436
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:10,936

♫ Since the day you entered my life, you've changed me into someone new ♫

It’s okay.

442

444

Woo!

445
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:45,976
Congratulations, Khun Nueng.

446
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:53,786
Your gallery is very beautiful as expected since you designed it yourself.

447
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,776
Thank you.

448
00:43:55,946 --> 00:44:01,366
It’s so pretty.  My friends over there are interested in holding an exhibition already.

449
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,456
Come with me to talk to them.

450
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:11,989
Please excuse me.

451
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:13,906
Mr. Chet, please let me borrow Khun Nueng for a moment.

452
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:14,976
Sure.

453
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,656
Oh, hello.

454
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:21,256
Hello.

455
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:21,882
Hope you’re doing well.

456
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:22,482
I'm doing great.

457
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:24,826
Hi!

458
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:31,986
Hi Doctor Nan, Doctor Dear, Doctor Mint. This is Khun Nueng. She’s my friend and the owner of this gallery.

459
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:34,126
Your gallery is beautiful.

460
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:35,416
Thank you.

461
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,206
I heard you’re interested in renting this place, right? That’s why I brought her here to discuss it.

462
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:40,376
She said she wants to rent the whole place.

463
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:42,426
Really?

464
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:48,286
I really like the painting.

465
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,296
Walk carefully.

466
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,286
You know you're a lightweight, why did you still drink so much?

467
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:21,206
Careful.

468
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:32,416
That's right! Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.

469
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:34,826
What’s the matter?

470
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:39,346
Did you have fun talking to that pretty doctor?

471
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:41,286
Her name is Wan Viva.

472
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:45,416
Why did you have to talk so closely to each other?

473
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:49,526
Couldn’t you guys stay apart?

474
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:53,446
Nueng, I think you’re too drunk.

475
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:55,186
I’ll take you upstairs and let you rest.

476
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:58,566
I’m not going anywhere.

477
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,766
You have to be mine.

478
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,726
Only mine.

479
00:46:17,606 --> 00:46:18,376
Nueng.

480
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:21,736
Someone might see us.

481
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,826
You want to do this, right?

482
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:52,846
Khun Nueng!

483
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:05,176
Ar-Nueng, is it possible for us to tell everyone that we're together?

484
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:07,176
Khun Nueng, what do you think you are doing?

485
00:47:07,446 --> 00:47:09,176
Anueng is my happiness.

486
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:13,946
Is this reason enough to make you be open-minded about this?

487
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,970
