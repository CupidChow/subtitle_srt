2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
You're …

3
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,720
Her mother?

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,000
We're old friends who haven't seen each other for years.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shouldn't you first ask me how I've been all this time?

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,479
If you're just going to be snarky, then I'm leaving.

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Please don't be mad.

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,000
The world is too small.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,000
What's the chances that you and Anueng know each other?

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Do you want to know what I named my daughter Anueng?

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,000
You wanted her name to be similar to mine?

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
You were smart when we were friends in school.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,480
And you're still smart today.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
But why?

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,720
Why did you give her a name similar to mine?

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,000
To be a constant reminder of the damage you caused.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,240
What's it got to do with me?

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
Do I need to remind you?

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you mean you like me?

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
We are just friends.

21
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,239
Why can't I like you?

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,480
Nueng … you know me.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,720
No one can ever love you as much as I love you.

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
But I don't love you.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,480
Why would you confess to me?

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
I just wanted you to know.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,480
I didn't want to keep it a secret from you any longer.

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Now its awkward.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,240
How can things now be the same between us?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, I've told you now.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,000
So … do you have anything to say?

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've already told you, I don't like you like that.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you want me to say?

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I love you and I want you to only see me.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
I can see you now.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know what I mean.

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,239
Don't pretend you don't understand.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,720
What do you want me to say?

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Listen.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
I've already told you,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,720
I will never be involved with you.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
Why not Nueng?

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,240
You don't need to know.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
Tell me why.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not worthy of me.

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
We're from different social classes.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Here … take this.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,240
You're only 16. You shouldn't be pregnant.

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
But … Nueng.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
I don't want this.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
The baby didn't do anything wrong.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you really ready to be a mother?

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
Will the guy take responsibility as well?

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Don't let this pregnancy ruin your life.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,000
The most important thing is your future.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
Not that baby.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
Nueng.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,480
Remember now? Everything you did?

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,480
Anueng almost wasn't born because of you.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I never thought I'd see you so shocked.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm honoured to have witnessed this.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
You drank that mixture?

63
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I did.

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh … you look like you've seen a ghost.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,480
After I drank it, I was afraid and ran and told my mother.

66
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
We were able to save Anueng.

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm glad.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,480
You're glad?

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Anueng was born prematurely and was in an incubator for months.

70
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,480
She needs to wear thick glasses because eyesight is so poor.

71
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
She had to start school three years late.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All this happened because I nearly miscarried.

73
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,480
I was wondering, why you need such thick glasses.

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Well, I already told you that my mother tried to get rid of me.

75
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
It caused me to be born prematurely.

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
This caused my eyesight to be poor.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
I feel deeply hurt.

78
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,000
Because I believed and trusted my close friend - Nueng.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,480
So I named my daughter Anueng.

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,480
So people would give her the nickname 'Nueng.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,480
So I would never forget the person who hurt me the most.

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
The person who said Anueng should never be born.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Who would have guessed,

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That the Universe would conspire,

85
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
To bring Anueng to meet the person who didn't want her born.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this fate?

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nueng.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Where's Piengfah?

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
She's back there.

90
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,240
What did you talk about. You look upset.

91
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,720
We talked about your relationship with her when she was in high school.

92
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,000
Congratulations

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
You have a daughter.

94
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
I need to go.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Miss Nueng, are you leaving?

96
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes

97
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm tired.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,480
Aww … if you don't stay, then I don't want to stay either.

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,000
Please stay a little longer … so you can keep me company.

101
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,000
If you're here, then I've got someone by my side.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you crying? Who made you cry?

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Nobody.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm here for you. Please don't cry.

105
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
Miss Nueng.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,240
Thank you for being alive.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Huh?

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,480
Thank you for being born.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My good girl.

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
(sigh)

111
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,480
You haven't said a word, or eaten anything since I arrived.

112
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm not hungry.

113
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
Is Anueng really my daughter?

114
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How old is Anueng now?

115
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
20.

116
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She's the right age to be Piengfah's and my daughter.

117
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Back then, did you know Piengfah was pregnant?

118
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was too young and immature to be a father.

119
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
I didn't know what to do.

120
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
What about Piengfah?

121
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,480
She told me and then completely disappeared.

122
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,000
Back then … I was just very immature.

123
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
I guess I'm a bad guy.

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Should I get a DNA test?

125
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not asking because I want to avoid responsibility.

126
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I want to be certain.

127
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because now I am ready to take responsibility.

128
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Then you should get a DNA test.

129
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
But 'Nueng might not appreciate it.

130
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I mean, Anueng.

131
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Nervous?

132
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
I didn't know you wanted a child.

133
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,480
As I told you, I'm ready now to take responsibility.

134
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Now that I know she exists.

135
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
And … my daughter is very cute.

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,240
I agree.

137
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Anueng is very cute.

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,720
It would have been horrible if Piengfah didn't get to the hospital in time.

139
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,480
But she did make it in time … and my daughter is very strong.

140
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Listen to you … you keep saying "daughter", "daughter"

141
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
You're so excited.

142
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
As soon as I found out she was my daughter,

143
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,000
I loved her immediately.

144
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,000
It's strange.

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Even though I didn't raise her,

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,720
I still love her so much.

147
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not strange at all.

148
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Anueng is easy to love.

149
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Whoever is close to her will naturally fall in love with her.

150
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,480
Do you also feel that way?

151
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm not in love … I'm just saying she's adorable.

152
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
I've never seen you care for anyone,

153
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
But you really seem to care about Anueng.

154
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:42,719
She is lucky to have you by her side.

155
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,000
Be quiet.

156
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,000
Miss Nueng.

157
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hello Mr Chet.

158
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,480
Are you well?

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm fine, thank you.

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,720
Did you have lots of fun at school?

161
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes … fun.

162
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You should go home. I'll call you later.

163
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,000
But I …

164
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,286
Have lots of fun on your way home.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Huh?

166
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
That's a weird way to say it.

167
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,920
I just said the same thing you did.

168
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,000
But you understood what I said, so please head home.

169
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
OK

170
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He looked confused.

171
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
He probably needs more sleep.

172
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,480
Why did you wait for me?

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,480
No reason.

174
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
No reason? Then why are you here?

175
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Why do I need a reason to see you?

176
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,480
I just missed you.

177
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What's the matter?

178
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
Nothing.

179
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,000
I haven't seen you since the school's centenary event.

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
How are you here now?

181
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Did your grandma allow you to meet me?

182
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How did you know?

183
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,000
Since that event, grandma will let me meet with you.

184
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
She said I could invite you over for a meal.

185
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,600
It's because you are descended from royalty.

186
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Invite me to have a meal?

187
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
I'll go if I'm not busy.

188
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,000
You're acting strange today.

189
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
No I'm not.

190
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Why are you avoiding eye contact?

191
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Are you feeling guilty about something?

192
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
No.

193
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,240
You're still avoiding eye contact.

194
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
No I'm not.

195
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,240
You did it again. You looked away.

196
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,480
The confident Miss Nueng never acted like this.

197
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
You've definitely done something wrong.

198
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Is that why my mother wants to talk to you?

199
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
Did my mother say something to you?

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,480
She did, otherwise you wouldn't acting like this.

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,480
What's the matter? Are you mad with me?

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm not.

203
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
If you're not mad, then why are you like this?

204
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,480
Don't pester me. I'm not mad at you.

205
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,240
If your not mad, then do you hate me?

206
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
Wow … why are you so mean?

207
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't be silly. I don't hate you.

208
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,240
If not hate then must be love.

209
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,500
Yes.

210
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,720
What was that?

211
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,480
Just now, you said "yes".

212
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,000
So what?

213
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It means that you do love me.

214
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
I want to know what type of love?

215
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
or …

216
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
You should go home.

217
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
You always chase me away.

218
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I don't want to go home yet.

219
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,720
If you're late, your grandma will yell at you. 

220
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Grandma won't yell at me,

221
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
She focussed on my mother now that she's back from overseas.

222
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
You should go home and spend time with your mother.

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,240
I don't want to.

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why not?

225
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,000
I hate my mother.

226
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,240
My mother said that you were the reason I almost wasn't born.

227
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,000
Did she think I'd believe her?

228
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,720
My mother didn't want me.

229
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
She should blame herself.

230
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why would she lie about this?

231
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't worry. I don't believe anything my mother says.

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
I won't stop loving you because of what she said.

233
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
Did you say that to your mother?

234
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Of course not … I only said that to you.

235
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,000
Why? Are you afraid of losing me?

236
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,480
You're not funny.

237
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Aww … you're so mean.

238
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But when you are mean … I like it.

239
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,000
But I'm not OK with my mother blaming you.

240
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,480
Anueng.

241
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
I ...

242
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
It's my mother.

243
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Anueng. Grandma is waiting for you.

244
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,240
But …

245
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
Go inside.

246
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Why did you tell Anueng it was my fault she almost wasn't born?

247
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
Because … its true.

248
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,480
My daughter prefers you over me.

249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,240
Even though you nearly caused her death.

250
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But now I'm so relieved that she's alive.

251
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm deeply ashamed … about what I did back then.

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
I understand why you hate me for what I did.

253
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,000
But why drag Anueng into this mess?

254
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,000
You ask why?

255
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Anueng knows that it was you who almost caused her death.

256
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Does it even bother you at all?

257
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
You wanted to talk to me … just to ask me that?

258
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,720
Well I'll answer.

259
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm consumed with guilt,

260
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,000
For the pain and hurt I caused back then.

261
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,480
Please help me to get closer to my daughter.

262
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm not family. How am I supposed to do that?

263
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Anueng trusts you.

264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,480
Please?

265
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,720
I'm going to get married, when I get back to America.

266
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I haven't even told my mother yet.

267
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
I want to take Anueng back with me.

268
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,017
Are you two still talking?

269
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What are you talking about?

270
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,000
I was just asking Miss Nueng,

271
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
If we should take you to the amusement park.

272
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Go to the amusement park with Miss Nueng?

273
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,720
Yes … all three of us.

274
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,132
Yes … Yes. (giggle)

275
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
This Saturday, Nueng.

276
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Lunch is ready.

277
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
Your grandma said you can speak three languages.

278
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,720
Really only two. Thai and English.

279
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,720
And your teacher at school said you were a model student.

280
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
I understand why your grandma is proud of you.

281
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm not sure about that.

282
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,720
Aww Nueng … Don't be so humble.

283
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Back in high school, no one was better than her.

284
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,240
I heard you also have a Master's Degree.

285
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,000
I never finished it.

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,480
I got bored with studying and dropped out.

287
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
If you want Anueng to love you,

288
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
The first thing you should do,

289
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Is stop your grandma hitting her with a cane.

290
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,240
You make your own choice.

291
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
But if it was me,

292
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,720
I'd make it very clear to your mother,

293
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,480
That she was not to hit Anueng again.

294
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
If you want Anueng to love you,

295
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,720
You need to protect her first.

296
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,000
I have to go.

297
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
Why didn't you tell me you've been hitting Anueng?

298
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
Why should I tell you?

299
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm the one who's been raising her.

300
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,480
What about you?

301
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,645
Why did you lie to Nueng?

302
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:19,239
Lie about what?

303
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,000
Were you eavesdropping on my conversation?

304
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't play dumb.

305
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,720
You told her that you drank that mixture she gave you.

306
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,000
You know perfectly well that isn't true.

307
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
Did you lie just to make her feel guilty?

308
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
It had nothing to do with her.

309
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,000
OK … I lied to her.

310
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:43,480
I know it had nothing to do with her.

311
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,000
So what?

312
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,480
Now you've discovered Nueng has Royal blood,

313
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
You take her side?

314
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Piengfah!

315
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,480
So tell me this.

316
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,480
Why did you have to hit Anueng with a cane?

317
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,720
How could you do that?

318
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,000
She's your granddaughter.

319
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,480
I didn't want her to end up like you.

320
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,480
You were a spoiled pregnant schoolgirl.

321
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,480
I hit Anueng because of you.

322
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,000
The more I hit her,

323
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The more it hurt me.

324
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You can't understand what I feel.

325
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,720
Because you didn't raise her.

326
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Why didn't you tell me you were … bringing other people today?

327
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes. Why did you invite them?

328
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,720
I told you Piengfah pressured me to go, but she didn't invite you.

329
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
Please let me join you.

330
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:20,000
Why should Piengfah have a chance to get closer to Anueng, but not me?

331
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Don't you want to do a DNA test first?

332
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,480
Anueng's cute face is proof she has my DNA.

333
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,000
She cute like me. That's all the proof I need.

334
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,480
Please let me join you. I want to get closer to my daughter.

335
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
If you go, you'll see Piengfah.

336
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,480
It was as long time ago. I'm sure Piengfah will be fine.

337
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:48,000
(sigh)

338
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
Why must this family drag me into this situation?

339
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,720
This Saturday is Anueng's birthday. Please let me join you.

340
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,240
How do you know that?

341
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,480
It'd be strange if I didn't know.

342
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,720
That's why Piengfah chose next Saturday.

343
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
You've done your research I see.

344
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,000
It's my daughter's birthday. Please let me come.

345
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,480
Please let me join as well.

346
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,000
You've been eavesdropping on us?

347
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
Who is this?

348
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:34,000
A guy with a crush on your daughter.

349
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey. Have you stopped stalking Anueng?

350
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes. I stopped as soon as you spoke to me.

351
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,480
I'm sorry.

352
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,720
He stalked Anueng?

353
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,720
This guy stalked my daughter like a psycho?

354
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,720
He's already apologised for what he did.

355
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Think about it. Will Anueng enjoy spending a day with three adults?

356
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You can join us if you want.

357
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Just don't do anything stupid.

358
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,000
Thank you.

359
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,240
It will be more fun for you.

360
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,240
You'll be bored if there are only adults.

361
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:34,000
Why did you invite yourself?

362
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,480
I'm her father. Why can't I be here?

363
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,720
You should ask that question to him?

364
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Anueng.

365
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,480
Everyone is her for you today.

366
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Yes.

367
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
Your mother wants to have fun with you today.

368
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,000
And to get closer to you.

369
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,000
As for Mr Chet

370
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:16,720
Maybe its too soon … but I'm going to tell you.

371
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
Congratulations.

372
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
You have a father.

373
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Nueng.

374
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You should have given her more time.

375
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
And Folk.

376
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,000
He has a crush on you.

377
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Ah … Miss Nueng. I'm scared.

378
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,000
Hey. Stop pretending.

379
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,480
I was practicing. Can't I practice being scared?

380
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,240
Well … I have to go to the toilet.

381
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
Wait Miss Anueng. I'll go with you.

382
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,000
It's your turn now.

383
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Ahhh!

384
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Are you having fun?

385
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There's an ice cream stall. Do you want some?

386
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
Do you want popcorn. There's some there.

387
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Anueng hasn't spoken to me once.

388
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,000
Me either.

389
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,000
I wanted to spend some quality time with my daughter.

390
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Why did you invite strangers?

391
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Is Chet a stranger?

392
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Well, you shouldn't have invited that boy.

393
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
Look at them.

394
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,480
I haven't had a chance to spend any time with my daughter.

395
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:53,000
If that boy wasn't here,

396
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
Would Anueng be friendlier towards you?

397
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But with that boy here its harder.

398
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We talked about this.

399
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What did you talk about?

400
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
None of your business.

401
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You need to give Anueng time.

402
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,480
You don't want me to take Anueng to America right?

403
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,000
What do you mean?

404
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,240
Anueng sees you as a hero,

405
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
But her parents are the bad guys.

406
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,720
You never intended to help me, did you?

407
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
(sigh)

408
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Seriously, what's your problem?

409
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,240
What have you actually done to help me get closer to Anueng?

410
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,479
OK then.

411
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll do something to make Anueng hate me,

412
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And make you the hero.

413
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,480
Satisfied now?

414
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,240
I'll be satisfied … when you do it. 

415
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What are you waiting for?

416
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Anueng.

417
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,000
I need to talk to you about something.

418
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,000
What's wrong?

419
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,240
Nothing.

420
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm asking what's wrong?

421
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,480
I haven't said anything yet. Why are you crying?

422
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:19,481
I'm not crying because of what you might say.

423
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
I'm just sad.

424
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,000
Why are you sad?

425
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,000
You want me to go and live with my mother in America.

426
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,000
How do you know?

427
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,479
I overheard my mother and grandma talking.

428
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,240
I don't know what I'm most sad about.

429
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
You lying to me and trying to make me go with my mother.

430
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
Or Mr Chet,

431
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,240
The guy who was flirting with you,

432
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,000
Suddenly becomes my father.

433
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,240
Or that guy.

434
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,783
Why did you invite him today?

435
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm not interested in him.

436
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
I think what I'm most sad about,

437
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
Is you.

438
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I just want the best for you.

439
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
I invited Folk,

440
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
So you wouldn't be bored.

441
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,240
As for your parents,

442
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,480
They both love you.

443
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,000
My parents are … both strangers to me.

444
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm a stranger too. We only just met …

445
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,000
It's not the same.

446
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,000
I want to stay with you.

447
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,000
I wanted to come here today with you.

448
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,480
You know how I feel about you.

449
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,000
Don't you feel anything for me?

450
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,000
Are you really that repulsed by me?

451
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,480
Of course not.

452
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,000
What do you want me to think?

453
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
What do you want me to feel?

454
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
Whether I have feelings or not.

455
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,720
You can think what you want.

456
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,000
It's up to you.

457
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Think about how your parents feel?

458
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
Actually … I'm a nobody to you.

459
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
But you will never leave me.

460
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,480
It's my fault you almost weren't born.

461
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,720
Why?

462
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,000
Why must you be so hurtful to me?

463
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Do you hate me now?

464
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,000
Do you want me to hate you?

465
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,240
Why are you trying to push me away?

466
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:56,480
Why do I have to be all alone?

467
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Why don't you want me here with you?

468
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
You don't hate me?

469
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,480
How can I hate the person I love?

470
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
One more thing.

471
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I know everything.

472
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,600
Were you eavesdropping on my conversation?

473
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,720
Don't play dumb.

474
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,240
You told her that you drank that mixture she gave you.

475
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:32,240
You know perfectly well that isn't true.

476
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Why did you lie just to make her feel guilty?

477
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
It had nothing to do with her.

478
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,000
OK … I lied to her.

479
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:43,480
I know it had nothing to do with her.

480
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,720
Miss Nueng. Please don't push me away from you.

481
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,602
I really do love you.

482
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,720
But you were almost not here,

483
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,000
Because of me.

484
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
OK

485
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,240
Since you want me to leave,

486
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I will leave.

487
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,262
No.

488
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Huh?

489
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:27,499
I don't want you to leave.

490
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I want you to stay.

491
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,000
Right here.

492
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Please don't go.

493
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:32,000
