2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,000
Come in.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,720
What's the matter?

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,244
Can't you sleep?

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm scared.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,723
Sleeping in a strange place.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,000
Can I sleep with you?

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,480
OK

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
Sleeping with Ar-Nueng is so exciting.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,720
Let's sleep.

11
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you doing?

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
When you sleep with your back to me,

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
It's like I'm here all alone.

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,000
You're a pest.

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,479
What do you want?

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,720
Can you hug me?

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Is it appropriate?

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,720
But I really can't sleep.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Please?

20
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
If I hug you,

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
You'll go to sleep?

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,480
What's the matter?

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
You said if I hug you, you will go to sleep.

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm not used to it yet.

25
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll probably fall to sleep soon.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,720
I feel so warm when I hug you.

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,720
When I say I love you,

28
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,240
Do you believe me?

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,240
You say it so often I don't want to believe you.

30
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
But I do believe you.

31
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,727
So that means,

32
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,480
I still have hope, right?

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,240
Time to sleep.

34
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Can't you love me too?

35
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Can't you love me too?

36
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Role Model?

37
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Ar-Nueng.

38
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,720
Here you are.

39
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:50,000
I've been looking for you for a while.

40
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
We should pack up and head home.

41
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
That's my novel.

42
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm returning it to you.

43
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey.

44
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
From now on, don't send me any more recordings of inappropriate scenes from your novel.

45
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
What inappropriate scenes do you mean?

46
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,720
Specifically?

47
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,240
Anueng.

48
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm serious.

49
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
I was just joking with you.

50
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,479
Promise me.

51
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,000
OK

52
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I won't do any more recordings.

53
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,265
But you'll miss out on the best scenes.

54
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
There weren't any.

55
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you read it?

56
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,480
You did read it.

57
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,720
Which chapters did you like?

58
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
You talk too much.

59
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OK

60
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
So … if I'm curious about something in the novel,

61
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Can I ask you?

62
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,720
What will you ask?

63
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well ...

64
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,720
The parts you forbid me to record.

65
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,000
If I'm curious, who can I ask?

66
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,000
Should I ask my friends?

67
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
You don't need to ask your friends.

68
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
If you have questions, just ask me.

69
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
Really?

70
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
Can I really ask you?

71
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
So ...

72
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
If I'd like to try something that's in the novel,

73
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,565
Can I try it with you?

74
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,252
You shouldn't ask me that.

75
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,720
Go.

76
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
Wait a moment.

77
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
Answer me first.

78
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't want to go.

79
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't be stubborn.

80
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,480
Time for you to go.

81
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Anueng.

82
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
Anueng, you're home.

83
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
You go inside now.

84
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,000
Khun Nueng, can you come in too.

85
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to talk to you about something.

86
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
I'd like to hear it too.

87
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
No.

88
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Your mother and I will talk.

89
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
You're tired from our trip.

90
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
You go inside and rest.

91
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm concerned about Anueng.

92
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't need to worry.

93
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Anueng will pass the university entrance exam.

94
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
I'm Nueng Sippakorn.

95
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,479
I'm not concerned about that.

96
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,240
What's the problem?

97
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm worried that Anueng is too close to you.

98
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
How so?

99
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Even though you and Anueng are both women,

100
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm worried that Anueng will fall in love with you.

101
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you talking about?

102
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,033
I'm just worried about her.

103
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Anueng is still young, you know.

104
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm worried that she will fall in love with you just like I did.

105
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Do you understand?

106
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
I know you also adore Anueng.

107
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,516
Can you please stop her falling for you?

108
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll do what you ask.

109
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,411
Thank you. I can stop worrying now.

110
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,480
If Anueng really did fall in love with you,

111
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm afraid she will end up heart broken and and then make poor decisions.

112
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
You're over-thinking this.

113
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,720
Anueng will never fall in love with me.

114
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
You are the only one to make that mistake.

115
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,480
Only you.

116
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,616
Thank you. You've put my mind at rest.

117
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
Anueng likes you very much.

118
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
And you like her a lot, right?

119
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Liking is better than hating.

120
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,720
You feel guilty because you didn't want her to be born, right?

121
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,720
You really do have a kind heart.

122
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm glad that you really do adore Anueng.

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,480
Yes … I do.

124
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,000
[Anueng: Are you asleep?]

125
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
Where do you want to take me?

126
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
I want to take you to see grandma.

127
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,000
(sigh)

128
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:46,724
Didn't I make it clear to you?

129
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
I told you I'm not going back there,

130
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Until Grandma is no longer there.

131
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
Khun Nueng. Grandma is sick.

132
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
When Grandma dies,

133
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,000
You'll regret that you decided that your anger was more important than your family.

134
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,731
Please Nueng. I'm begging you to come with me.

135
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Did you miss me?

136
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,240
So you made Sam to come and collect me.

137
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
I rarely see you. How have you been doing?

138
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm doing great as you can see.

139
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,480
Because I don't have you controlling me.

140
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,720
Did you just come to fight with me?

141
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes

142
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Now that we've met, I need to fight.

143
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Nueng.

144
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
I don't want to fight with you.

145
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:53,239
Have you eaten?

146
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,240
Can we have a meal together?

147
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,435
No, I haven't eaten.

148
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
But I have lost my appetite.

149
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,240
Never mind. She doesn't want to eat.

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,240
Let's go.

151
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,240
You look older.

152
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Doesn't the Botox work any more?

153
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,720
Yes. I'm old now.

154
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,480
We can stop lots of things, but not the aging process.

155
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
How do you feel that I didn't want to live like you wanted me to?

156
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:38,720
Why do you ask me this now?

157
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,720
You're the reason I left this place and ran away from my wedding.

158
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
You wanting to control me ended up causing my sister's death.

159
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
How do you feel?

160
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Nueng. Please stop.

161
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,960
I think we should have a meal together.

162
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,480
The cook prepared some of your favourite dishes.

163
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,871
I don't want to eat.

164
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:04,239
You can eat with grandma. I have no appetite.

165
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,000
Goodbye grandma.

166
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Having problems?

167
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
Allow me to help

168
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,480
OK

169
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
This one.

170
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Oh this one?

171
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,000
I already told you which subjects I can help her with.

172
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:43,014
Are you sure your old notes aren't of date?

173
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If Anueng doesn't pass her exam and her mother takes her to America.

174
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What will I do?

175
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,021
Anueng said she wanted to come to this tutoring school, so I allowed it.

176
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
It's only one mathematics subject, right?

177
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,800
You're here to pick up your daughter.

178
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,240
Why did you bring me as well?

179
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ah, Anueng.

180
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Anueng.

181
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Greetings.

182
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,240
Folk, you study here as well?

183
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,480
It's a very popular tutoring school.

184
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,000
Are you hungry?

185
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,480
Shall we go out to eat?

186
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
Do you want to join us Folk?

187
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
No sorry, I have to go.

188
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
Then shall we go?

189
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,751
Umm … I want to ask you for something.

190
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,000
Would you agree …

191
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,024
For me to take your glass once you're finished with it?

192
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,000
No, I won't.

193
00:19:58,483 --> 00:19:59,240
Why?

194
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Well …

195
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,720
I don't want to have a DNA test,

196
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
To prove I'm your daughter.

197
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,000
Even now I don't know how to act.

198
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
If you want me to have a DNA test,

199
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,023
I'm just … not comfortable with it.

200
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,480
Anueng.

201
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't want anything from you.

202
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Your wealth. Your surname. I don't want anything.

203
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,720
I'm just happy to live my life with grandma.

204
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The things you want to do ...

205
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't want it.

206
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Thank you.

207
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Didn't you tell me you wouldn't do that?

208
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Why did she refuse?

209
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,480
Who would be happy to be asked to get a DNA test like that?

210
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
If I was Anueng, I wouldn't like it either. 

211
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,480
She already calls you 'father'.

212
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,720
Shouldn't that be enough?

213
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,000
I want a DNA test to ensure everything is official.

214
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,000
Anueng is my only heir.

215
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,240
If something happens to me, I want everything to go to my rightful heir.

216
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:20,000
And avoid any problems in the future.

217
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
I will explain this to Anueng later.

218
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
Thank you Khun Nueng.

219
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm not sure she will understand, but I will try.

220
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,720
Why didn't you wait for me?

221
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,000
I knew you would follow me.

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,240
You seem OK. Aren't you angry with your father?

223
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
A little bit.

224
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,000
But it's not a reason for me to be angry with you.

225
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,240
Oh … Did you make a voice recording for me today?

226
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:12,493
There's no need for a voice recording today.

227
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:14,480
Why?

228
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Today we'll go to tutoring together.

229
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,493
I'll make some notes for you.

230
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,480
Anything you don't understand, you can ask me.

231
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
Make sure you keep these notes for later.

232
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
Today, you need to read ...

233
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
This book.

234
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,720
I'll choose the page.

235
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,720
Start from here.

236
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,480
If you don't understand something, mark it and then ask me.

237
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Anueng.

238
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,480
Anueng.

239
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,000
Ar-Nueng loves Anueng.

240
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Don't bite your nails.

241
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm so nervous.

242
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
Ar-Nueng. Will I pass the university entrance exam?

243
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
No you won't.

244
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,720
Why did you say that?

245
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
You'll discourage Anueng.

246
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I don't want her to pass the entrance exam.

247
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I passed. I passed.

248
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Hey. Anueng's grandparents and our relatives want to meet her.

249
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
Grandfather and grandmother are very nice.

250
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:47,000
It's not about that.

251
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,720
Slowly is fine.

252
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll wait until you're ready to meet them.

253
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,720
Now you've passed the entrance exam, what can I get you?

254
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:02,720
Don't worry about price. I'm your father.

255
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,720
You can ask for anything.

256
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Hey … looks like it's your turn to please our daughter.

257
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,720
Of course. This is what I do so my daughter loves me.

258
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,000
What would you like?

259
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,720
You should answer your father. It's good manners.

260
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,240
OK grandma.

261
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,480
I'll tell you later.

262
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
It will be a secret between us.

263
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,480
You want to know what I asked my father for, don't you?

264
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,480
Maybe we're not really that close.

265
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,480
That's why you're keeping secrets from me.

266
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's OK. I'm not your parent.

267
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,720
It's good you're not my parent.

268
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Then you couldn't be my girlfriend.

269
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Your girlfriend?

270
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,480
Please let me keep this secret from you.

271
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If I tell you, it will spoil the surprise.

272
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,240
What did you mean by 'your girlfriend'?

273
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't worry.

274
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,000
I was just teasing.

275
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
But you know how I feel about you.

276
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
So why?

277
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,480
Why are you keeping a secret from me?

278
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:28,240
Is it a big deal?

279
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,480
Yes … it is a big deal.

280
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,719
It's an important change for me.

281
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,000
I promise that you'll be the first person to see it.

282
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:49,720
Can you give me a hint?

283
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
OK, I'll give you a hint.

284
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
Look at my eyes.

285
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
This is the hint.

286
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
Why did you bring me here?

287
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
The weather is hot.

288
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There's lot's of students.

289
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,720
Anueng ask me to bring you here.

290
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,720
Ar-Nueng.

291
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Do I look beautiful without glasses?

292
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,000
Do I look more grown up?

293
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
A little bit.

294
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:52,963
Aww … is it so hard to give me a compliment?

295
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,720
Can you see clearly without your glasses?

296
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,480
Surprise!

297
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,240
I don't need glasses anymore.

298
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,000
So you asked your father for laser surgery?

299
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes

300
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I was away for several days for my surgery.

301
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,240
You're so mean. You didn't call me once.

302
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,480
Didn't you miss me?

303
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,480
Didn't you?

304
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480
Not really.

305
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Hey … if you knew about this, why didn't you tell me?

306
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Anueng asked me to keep this a secret.

307
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Can you please screen Anueng's friends for me.

308
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,720
She's all grown up and in university now.

309
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,240
Many guys will flirt with her.

310
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,240
Her father and grandma are here.

311
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,240
Why do I need to screen her friends?

312
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I trust you the most.

313
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Also, you're the only one Anueng listens to.

314
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,000
And I know you'll look after her.

315
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,000
Anueng is a sensible girl.

316
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You don't need to worry.

317
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:01,000
If she ends up like me,

318
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,720
My mother will have a meltdown.

319
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
What are you two talking about?

320
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,720
Your mother doesn't want to see guys flirting with you.

321
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,000
So, its OK if I'm in a relationship with a woman?

322
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,720
Umm … well …

323
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,253
What do you mean?

324
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm not sure.

325
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,240
What do you mean you're not sure?

326
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,240
You allow it or you don't.

327
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I need an answer.

328
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,240
Do you allow it or not?

329
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Umm … I don't know.

330
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,240
Ask Ar-Nueng.

331
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,515
Ar-Nueng always gives into me.

332
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,480
So it means...

333
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,720
I can be in a relationship with a woman, right?

334
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't hurry to start a relationship.

335
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:03,720
Focus on your studies for now.

336
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Where's my mother?

337
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,720
She went to the toilet.

338
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
You said I'd be the first person to see your change.

339
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Everyone in the university saw you before me.

340
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,742
It couldn't be helped.

341
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,800
You didn't do a pinky promise with me.

342
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,240
It's good that I can stay here.

343
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,720
And stay by your side.

344
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,480
I will definitely grow up worthy of you.

345
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,480
Hmmm…

346
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
Stay in your seat.

347
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,000
And then I'll be yours and yours alone.

348
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,267
How does it taste?

349
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
It's absolutely delicious.

350
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
I could eat this forever.

351
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
How were your classes today? Did any boys flirt with you?

352
00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:26,000
It's so delicious. Where did you buy this?

353
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
You didn't answer my question.

354
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,720
University is good. I have a lot of friends.

355
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,480
I didn't ask you that.

356
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Did any boys flirt with you?

357
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,733
Umm… I'm not sure it was really flirting.

358
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,479
Some guys did ask for my phone number.

359
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Did you give it to them?

360
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Guess.

361
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,325
I didn't give it to them.

362
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because someone I know will be jealous.

363
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,479
Because they ask me this question every day.

364
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm not jealous.

365
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm just concerned.

366
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,720
Oh I see.

367
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You're not jealous.

368
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,240
But… you should be jealous.

369
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,000
Because if I fall for someone else,

370
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,000
Then you'll be lonely.

371
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,000
Eat your dinner. It's getting cold.

372
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,480
That dish I just had.

373
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
You cooked it didn't you?

374
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Yes.

375
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Why are you so cool?

376
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
When I graduate, we should get married.

377
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,720
I'm so lucky that you're good at everything.

378
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,000
Can you cook for me every day?

379
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
You're just a kid.

380
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,720
I'm not a kid anymore.

381
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:08,719
If you act like a cry-baby, then you must be a kid.

382
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,254
I'm not jealous.

383
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,755
But I am concerned about you.

384
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,480
Because you're so young, you put me on a pedestal.

385
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,479
But soon your attention will be on your friends.

386
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,719
It is me...

387
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,719
Who would rather be left alone.

388
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,000
It's time for you to go home.

389
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I don't want to.

390
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Don't be like this.

391
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
When I have free time, I will still come and visit you.

392
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:15,000
Otherwise someone will come and steal you from me.

393
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Who will steal me?

394
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There are many people who like you.

395
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So what?

396
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,240
I don't love anyone.

397
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,240
Except me, right?

398
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,000
Ok. I know.

399
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh … I met Folk.

400
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,480
He's in the building next to mine.

401
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,000
I can't remember what faculty it is.

402
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
He's got a new haircut and looks more mature.

403
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:08,240
You too … look more mature.

404
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,240
With no glasses and your hair down.

405
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,000
You look like a woman.

406
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Many guys will look at you.

407
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,000
But I'll only look at you.

408
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,240
I'll wait and see ...

409
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,000
How long you say that.

410
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,240
Hello Ar-Nueng.

411
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Where are you? Why aren't you here yet?

412
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,720
Oh sorry. I forgot. I'll come right away.

413
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,480
It's late now. You stay with your friends.

414
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,720
Hello beautiful doctor. Are you free now?

415
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Can we go out for a meal?

416
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,720
You phone has run a few times. Shouldn't you answer it?

417
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:03,480
No need.

418
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
It's just an annoying girl I know.

419
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
A girl?

420
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
It's nothing.

421
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
How have you been? I haven't seen you for ages.

422
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:18,480
I'm as beautiful as always as you can see.

423
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's true.

424
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,480
Are you being sarcastic?

425
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,479
So what's up with you?

426
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,000
It's been ages since we've had dinner together.

427
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,000
It's boring to eat alone.

428
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:35,416
I realized that … I only have one real friend.

429
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And when you're with me, you feel better?

430
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Yes … better.

431
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
A lot better.

432
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You should eat now.

433
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Thank you for the meal.

434
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:18,975
You're welcome.

435
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,000
Whenever you're feeling bored, you should give me a call.

436
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I will.

437
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
You said it.

438
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,000
Now promise me.

439
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Hey. You're playing hard to get.

440
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,240
If you disappear again, I'll severe relations with you.

441
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,240
OK!

442
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,480
Sure.

443
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:40,514
Huh?

444
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You should head home now.

445
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,240
I don't want to go home yet.

446
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,264
Do I really have to go?

447
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
OK.

448
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,000
Bye. Call me.

449
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,720
Bye.

450
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Who is she?

451
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
A friend.

452
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Liar.

453
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:28,720
You don't have any friends.

454
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Who says I don't?

455
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,720
You also have friends.

456
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,000
You should understand.

457
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,276
What sort of friends blow kisses?

458
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Close friends.

459
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,720
Why are you smiling like that?

460
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,240
Who is she?

461
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I just told you. She's my close friend.

462
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,000
Why are you here? It's already late.

463
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,015
I told you I would come.

464
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:10,714
But you wouldn't pick up my calls.

465
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,000
Ah. I see.

466
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,000
Why didn't you call me back?

467
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:20,480
I forgot.

468
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:31,000
Let's go inside and talk.

469
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,480
Why didn't you understand me?

470
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,240
What exactly didn't I understand?

471
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,240
If you understood, why did you do this to me?

472
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,479
Don't raise your voice at me.

473
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I don't love you anymore.

474
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,479
Don't turn your back on me.

475
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I hate that.

476
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I hat it when I see you going out with another woman.

477
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,486
You know how I feel about you.

478
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,240
Why do you treat me like this?

479
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:19,480
Can't I be the only one?

480
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,000
What are you talking about?

481
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:28,480
You haven't spoken once about that night.

482
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I understand why you haven't.

483
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,480
But that doesn't mean we never kissed.

484
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,000
Do you remember … when we kissed?

485
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,720
Anueng.

486
00:43:42,272 --> 00:43:43,240
Stop talking about this.

487
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,479
I've already said it.

488
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
We won't talk about this again.

489
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,240
But we are talking.

490
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,720
We kissed each other.

491
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,480
And you love me too.

492
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,000
Ar-Nueng loves Anueng.

493
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,756
What's the matter Sam?

494
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,680
Khun Nueng.

495
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,480
What's wrong with you voice?

496
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:23,792
Grandma has passed away.

497
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,240
I'm sorry for your loss.

498
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,000
Thank you.

499
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,720
Please go inside.

500
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,000
Ar-Nueng.

501
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Go inside with your father and grandma.

502
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Nueng, Sam, Mon. I'm sorry for your loss.

503
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
Are you OK?

504
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Thank you for coming.

505
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,720
Khun Nueng.

506
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,240
What's the matter Tua Lek?

507
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,240
Grandma isn't here anymore.

508
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,720
You're already grown up.

509
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,240
I should stay here with Grandma.

510
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,000
Tua lek.

511
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,479
Listen to me.

512
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:21,240
If you don't leave this house, how will you stay with Mon?

513
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,495
Think of it this way. Grandma has passed away.

514
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,479
You and Mon can live here now.

515
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:30,480
It's good for you.

516
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Nueng. Grandma just passed away.

517
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
Why would you talk about this?

518
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,720
You mean you want me to cry?

519
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,720
OK. I can do that for you.

520
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Khun Nueng!

521
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Tua Lek, listen to me.

522
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Even if Grandma didn't die today,

523
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,720
She probably would have died tomorrow.

524
00:47:58,778 --> 00:48:00,778
Grandma won't wake up because you cry.

525
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,000
Understand?

526
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,479
Nueng.

527
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,240
Oh… Tua Lek.

528
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,739
Did you contact the lawyer?

529
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,000
Why do I need to contact the lawyer?

530
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,479
Oh… Tua Lek, it's about the will.

531
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
There's only the two of us left.

532
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The wealth will be divided in half.

533
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:22,720
Hey. I forgot.

534
00:48:24,517 --> 00:48:28,000
Tua Lek. Do I have to pay taxes on inheritance?

535
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Khun Nueng.

536
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,460
You're not upset. I understand that.

537
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
But I don't see why you would say things that hurt Sam.

538
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,000
I've just spoken the truth.

539
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,720
OK. OK. OK.

540
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,000
I'll stop talking about it.

541
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm leaving.

542
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,031
Won't you stay here tonight?

543
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,000
No. I won't. I'm afraid of ghosts.

544
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Grandma and I fought when she was alive.

545
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:57,720
On this first day of her death.

546
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
She'll return as a ghost and break my neck.

547
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,240
Oh… Tua Lek.

548
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,720
I'll come back on the day of the cremation.

549
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'll go now.

550
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,259
Grandma misses you.

551
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,240
Since you left, she hasn't been happy.

552
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,720
Grandma still has you and she loves you very much.

553
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,240
When grandma is gone, you'll regret that you didn't reconcile with her today.

554
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,760
Tua Lek, listen to me.

555
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,720
An old woman like grandma won't easily get sick and die. Believe me.

556
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Ar-Nueng.

557
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Go away. I'm tired.

558
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,000
I told you to go away.

559
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,720
Ar-Nueng.

560
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,033
Please open the door.

561
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,480
Ar-Nueng.

562
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Ar-Nueng.

563
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Are you OK?

564
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,240
I'm OK. I'm fine.

565
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,720
I see you.

566
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,000
I know you.

567
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
I know you're hurting.

568
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,240
Don't pretend to know me.

569
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,240
We wear the same masks.

570
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:06,007
I see you.

571
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,000
The more you acted like it was nothing.

572
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,479
The more I knew.

573
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,000
You're hurting more than anyone else.

574
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,240
I'm here for you.

575
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's OK. I'm here for you.

576
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,000
If on that day.

577
00:54:51,265 --> 00:54:53,480
I had spoken nicely to grandma.

578
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,000
We probably would have reconciled.

579
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,240
If I had agreed to marry Chet.

580
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,000
Grandma would have been happy.

581
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,000
Don't overthink things now.

582
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,720
Don't blame yourself.

583
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,479
This isn't the proper time.

584
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,480
I shouldn't being doing this now.

585
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,000
It's not the proper time.

586
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:08,480
Never mind.

587
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,000
Please stay with me.

588
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:17,480
Can you?

589
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,720
Tell me what you want.

590
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,720
I'll do anything for you.

591
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,720
Anything?

592
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,240
I really wasn't dreaming.

593
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,240
Ar-Nueng. What's the matter?

594
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,000
Anueng.

595
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,480
About last night.

596
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,480
Can you act like nothing happened?

597
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,240
Reset … to zero.

598
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Why?

599
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,240
What do you think last night was?

600
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
It's love.

601
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,739
Is it love?

602
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:23,720
For me it is.

603
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,720
For me...

604
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,720
You were just something …

605
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,240
That allowed me to forget my grief.

606
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,000
You said to me, didn't you?

607
01:02:44,632 --> 01:02:45,989
You would do anything for me.

608
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,240
That's it.

609
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,000
That's what I needed you to be last night.

610
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,480
Anueng.

611
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,510
I'm sorry.

612
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:10,000
