1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,450
I'm sorry, Khun Nueng.

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,680
About what?

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,730
About yesterday... I didn't think it through.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,880
There're just the two of us left.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,880
Our inheritance will be split in half.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,280
Oh!

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,790
I completely forgot.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,100
Tuo Lek, do we need to pay taxes for our inheritance?

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
Khun Nueng, it's okay if you don't feel sad.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,830
But there's no need to say such a thing to hurt Sam's feelings.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:51,280
I should be the one who knows you best. You always try to be cheerful whenever you feel sad.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,030
It doesn't matter if others don't understand you.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,550
But, I'm the last member of your family...

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,200
I should be the one who knows your the most.

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,530
It's okay.

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,900
I wasn't that nice yesterday.

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,180
There're only just two of us left, Khun Nueng.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,980
Can we not fight anymore?

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,430
I never once wanted to fight with you, Tuo Lek.

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,950
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,700
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,000
It's okay.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
Are you okay?

24
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,180
Have you eaten anything yet?

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,280
I lost my appetite.

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,600
How about this?

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,030
I'll find something for you to eat first.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,850
It will be troublesome if you faint at the funeral.

29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay?

30
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,250
Khun Nueng.

31
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,130
Why didn't you make a sound before coming in?

32
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,350
I called you a couple of times already.

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,150
Eh? That mark on your neck...

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,260
Can you pretend like you didn't see it?

35
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,740
So... are you going back to your palace?

36
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,470
(Monks chanting)

37
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,330
Everything still looks the same.

38
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,410
I miss grandma.

39
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,290
Me too.

40
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,630
I'm back.

41
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,170
Khun Nueng, what do you want me to do with this room?

42
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,170
Please keep it like how it was.

43
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,330
I thought my grandma will stay with me...

44
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,840
forever.

45
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,870
This palace...

46
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,260
no longer has her.

47
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,760
She's gone forever.

48
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,940
She's still here.

49
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,960
You're right.

50
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,190
Thank you.

51
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,810
Please clean her room every day.

52
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,330
Just like when she used to live here.

53
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,110
Understood, Khun Nueng.

54
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,170
What do you think happened last night?

55
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,690
It's love.

56
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,260
Is it love?

57
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,460
For me, it is love.

58
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,190
For me...

59
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,900
You're just something

60
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,680
that makes me forget bad things.

61
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,630
You said it to me, didn't you?

62
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,680
That you can be anything for me.

63
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,560
That's right.

64
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,480
That's what I let you be last night.

65
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,840
What's wrong, Folk? Why are you calling me so late?

66
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,000
Where?

67
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:33,974
Where's Anueng?

68
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,004
She's inside.

69
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,074
Woo!

70
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,224
Nueng.

71
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:04,174
I must be really drunk too see Ar-Nueng in front of me.

72
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:10,504
You're out of control now.

73
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:13,924
It's really you, Ar-Nueng.

74
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,224
Long time no see.

75
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,024
Hi!

76
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,524
Why are you not going back home?

77
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,004
What are you doing here?

78
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,074
Go home with me now.

79
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,804
This is what a teenage life is.

80
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:28,954
If I don't have fun now, when should I do it then?

81
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,324
Go home.

82
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,224
No! I won't go!

83
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:35,814
Why are you in such a hurry?

84
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:37,824
Let's drink some more.

85
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,324
Let go of me. I don't like it.

86
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,484
She said she doesn't like it.

87
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:44,784
Didn't you hear that?

88
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,604
I just wanted to ask her to dance with me. I didn't do anything wrong.

89
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,474
Who is she? Your sister?

90
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,064
She's my mom's friend.

91
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:01,874
What did she say again?

92
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,124
Mom's friend.

93
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:09,054
I'm her everything.

94
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:23,904
Why are you meddling in my life? I'm just having fun with my friends.

95
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,304
There's a guy touching you and you said it's fun?

96
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:31,764
Go home.

97
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,333
No!

98
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:37,784
I already told grandma that I'm working at my friend's house.

99
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,254
You lied to grandma just to come here?

100
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,154
Why do you even bother?

101
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,704
We're not close anymore, don't you remember that?

102
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,224
Nueng.

103
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,074
I don't think we should be fighting here.

104
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:00,454
I see. So it's you who brought her here.

105
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:07,894
I wouldn't have been your friend if I had known you had such a big mouth! Get out of my face!

106
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:08,534
Nueng!

107
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,854
If this is your way of getting my attention,

108
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,324
you've succeeded.

109
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:26,304
Let's go home.

110
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:28,754
No!

111
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,574
Okay.

112
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,094
We won't go home then.

113
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,364
What?

114
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,374
Why did you give up so easily?

115
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,134
If I say I won't go back, you have to force me then.

116
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:52,004
You think I don't know what you want?

117
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:58,614
We'll go back to my palace.

118
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,224
Thanks for taking care of her.

119
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:08,804
I'll take it from here.

120
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:09,824
Alright.

121
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,204
No!

122
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,204
Nueng. Nueng!

123
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,454
Let go of me!

124
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,774
It's nothing. Please go to rest.

125
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:29,174
Okay. Do you want me to arrange the room?

126
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:30,054
No need.

127
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,534
I'll let her sleep on the sofa.

128
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:34,924
Okay, ma'am.

129
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:38,854
Nueng!

130
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,044
Where do you think you're going?

131
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:43,184
Anywhere but here.

132
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:47,924
If you're letting me sleep on the sofa just because you feel sorry for me, then stop.

133
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,774
I can take care of myself.

134
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:51,854
Okay.

135
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,274
You want to fight, right?

136
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:55,504
Alright.

137
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,624
I'm ready.

138
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:58,964
Let's fight.

139
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,704
Why do you even bother to come after me?

140
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,924
Because you went to such a place!

141
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:07,824
Where did you think you would stay tonight if I didn't go find you?

142
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:10,254
My friend's house!

143
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:10,804
Nueng.

144
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:16,204
You have a best friend whose house you can just crash at now?

145
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,934
What do you expect me to do? Where should I go instead?

146
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,704
I just got dumped heartlessly.

147
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,684
I'm just something you use to vent out your feelings.

148
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:35,904
If you're mad at me, then take it out on me.

149
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,004
Why did you do this to yourself?

150
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:44,244
If you're mad at me, then take it out on me.

151
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,444
That's easy for you to say!

152
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,904
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

153
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:58,074
I'm hurt.

154
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,574
What you did to me...

155
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,224
It's freaking awful!

156
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:11,954
Enough.

157
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:12,954
Why?

158
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,224
You can't accpet the truth?

159
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:19,374
What you did, how is it any different from nail and bail?

160
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:20,104
Nueng.

161
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:22,504
That's enough.

162
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:24,854
Come with me.

163
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,254
- I'm not going anywhere with you!
- Nueng!

164
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,454
Don't be stubborn.

165
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,204
I don't want to go. Let go of me!

166
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:39,784
Nueng, can you please listen to me?

167
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:43,074
Why did you bring me here?

168
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:47,304
Are you afraid that someone might hear what you did to me?

169
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,134
What did I do?

170
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,674
It was you who did that to me that night.

171
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:56,804
What's the difference?

172
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:05,874
We already did it, but you told me to pretend like nothing happened.

173
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,254
How could you do that to me?

174
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,724
Why are you being silent now?

175
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:22,734
You see me as something you use to vent out your feelings.

176
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:25,014
You can do anything to me.

177
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,134
Without caring how I feel.

178
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:38,234
Because I'm the only one...

179
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,874
who loves you.

180
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,434
It's always been like that.

181
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:54,554
Isn't that right?

182
00:17:58,314 --> 00:17:59,584
Is it?

183
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:12,234
Nueng.

184
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,154
What are you doing?

185
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,394
I miss you.

186
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,374
Are you trying to make it up to me?

187
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,514
I will count one to five.

188
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,684
If you won't stop being so curious...

189
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,934
I will start buttoning up one button at a time.

190
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:13,794
One.

191
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:15,404
Huh?

192
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:16,484
Nothing.

193
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:17,894
I'm just counting.

194
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:20,104
Two.

195
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:26,564
Is this the way you're going to make it up to me?

196
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,814
Does it work?

197
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:35,394
This is how you're going to do it, right?

198
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:47,834
Yes.

199
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,134
I'm trying to make it up to you.

200
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,834
If I had been more sane on that day,

201
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,604
everything wouldn't have turned out this way.

202
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,294
Your parents...

203
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:21,614
Your grandma...

204
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:28,604
Everything is chaotic.

205
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,324
Why do you have to care about what other people think?

206
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,224
This is about us.

207
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:48,424
I used to tell you...

208
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,254
that I love you.

209
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,494
I mean it.

210
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,564
My feelings never change.

211
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:12,844
Nueng, listen to me.

212
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,814
You're still young.

213
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:25,304
You have the chance to meet so many people.

214
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,084
Today, you might say that you love me.

215
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,604
But in the future--

216
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:46,664
That person is right in front of me.

217
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:49,774
You're my dearest.

218
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,204
If we do it again,

219
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:30,784
will I get dumped this time?

220
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:39,974
It's because of me, right?

221
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:44,094
You've lost your confidence because of me.

222
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,454
I'm so sorry.

223
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,944
Don't worry now.

224
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,904
I cry every day.

225
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:02,844
I'm sorry.

226
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,924
I'll make you believe in me.

227
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,244
Will you trust me?

228
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,144
I think...

229
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:17,544
there's so much more you have to learn from last time.

230
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:24,504
I'll teach you how.

231
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,694
Ar-Nueng.

232
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:15,824
Ar-Nueng.

233
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,866
What's wrong?

234
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,616
Are you feeling dizzy?

235
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:02,276
How did I get into this clothes?

236
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,216
Do you want to get more sleep? Hm?

237
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,186
Nueng.

238
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:15,936
I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

239
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:17,356
Hm?

240
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,226
I can hear you.

241
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,066
I'm just... a bit confused.

242
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:30,316
What are you confused about?

243
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:32,946
Well...

244
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,976
What happened last night?

245
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,016
I couldn't remember anything.

246
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,636
I guess you still have a hangover.

247
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:45,986
Let's get more sleep.

248
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:51,276
I don't want to.

249
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:53,776
It will give me a headache.

250
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,576
Also, I have to go work on my project at my friend's room today.

251
00:27:58,226 --> 00:27:59,016
Which friend?

252
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:06,046
My university friend.

253
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,876
Freshers do have lots of work, more than I thought.

254
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,836
Don't go.

255
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:21,516
Just go straight home after class. I'll go pick you up.

256
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:22,676
There's no need.

257
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:25,576
I don't want to bother you.

258
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:31,716
Are you telling me you don't remember a single thing from last night?

259
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,536
Why?

260
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,856
What happened last night?

261
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:38,436
Nueng.

262
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,966
Do you think I'm stupid?

263
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:45,786
Oh.

264
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:48,206
I remember it now.

265
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,796
What do you expect from last night?

266
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,216
If you don't want anything,

267
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,446
then let's just pretend nothing happened.

268
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:01,976
Nueng.

269
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,326
I think we should reset the whole thing

270
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:09,656
Let's go back to zero, just like before. What do you think?

271
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,026
Alright.

272
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,376
If that's what you want.

273
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:39,876
Let's just pretend...

274
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:44,456
like nothing happened.

275
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:52,876
Okay.

276
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,176
Anueng is hanging out with this group of boys?

277
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:24,936
Yes.

278
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,116
I let my people keep an eye on her.

279
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,636
I don't want my daughter to get involved with these rascals.

280
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,236
Your daughter is very charming.

281
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:33,996
Khun Nueng.

282
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,526
This is not the time to joke around.

283
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:36,456
I'm not joking.

284
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:37,616
It's a compliment.

285
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:45,435
Be careful. If she knows you ordered someone to spy on her, she will be angry at you.

286
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:46,655
I won't let her find out.

287
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:54,356
Are you going to tell Fah about this?

288
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,366
She has already returned home abroad.

289
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:58,416
Also...

290
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,606
Anueng is closer to you than Fah.

291
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,436
Should I try to be my daughter's advisor?

292
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:07,316
How?

293
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,676
Like... I should be more understanding.

294
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:18,276
Because if I force her too much, she will go against me and never rely on me anymore.

295
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:25,236
When I'm close to my daughter, I will invite her boyfriend to visit our home. Then, everything will be under my control.

296
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:31,806
If you think that's a good idea, then I also think it's good.

297
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:34,962
I'll call you once I receive more information.

298
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,606
I gotta go.

299
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,176
They don't have the color I want again!

300
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:04,276
You haven't got it yet?

301
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,096
Nope.

302
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,166
Can we check out another shop?

303
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,696
We've been to three shops already.

304
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,556
I know. But they don't have what I want. What can I do?

305
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:12,616
What about that shop?

306
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:15,336
That shop doesn't look nice.

307
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,336
Oh!

308
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,586
This shop looks good. Wanna go?

309
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:29,506
Let's go.

310
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,066
Hey.

311
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:33,866
Huh?

312
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,386
I don't like it when someone is clinging to my arm.

313
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,816
What? That's only when it happens with someone you're not close to.

314
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:44,826
But we're so close.

315
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:47,066
Let's go. Stop playing hard to get.

316
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:45,596
What's up?

317
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:49,476
Khun Nueng, have you seen Anueng lately?

318
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:51,776
No.

319
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:52,476
Why?

320
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:56,656
My mom called me telling me that Anueng doesn't go back home these days.

321
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,656
I thought she's with you.

322
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:01,896
She's not with me.

323
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:03,516
She's addicted to her friends now.

324
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:10,306
But don't worry. Chet and I are keeping an eye on her.

325
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:11,876
Addicted to friends?

326
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:13,696
Her university friends?

327
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,226
Girls or boys?

328
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,626
Calm down.

329
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,806
It's a normal thing for a girl who just entered a university.

330
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,016
She's in a new society now.

331
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,776
Don't worry. I'll keep you updated.

332
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:45,876
Anueng doesn't go to the nightclubs anymore, right?

333
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:46,986
I don't think so.

334
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,866
Suddenly, that group of friends doesn't dare to come near her. I don't know why.

335
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,506
If it were you, what would you do?

336
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:01,525
I would nip it in the bud.

337
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:07,265
Chet...

338
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:08,305
Huh?

339
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:10,686
Nothing.

340
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:11,966
Please continue.

341
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:16,926
Lately, Nueng has become close to another friend.

342
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:19,546
Another friend?

343
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,656
You mean yourself?

344
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:24,226
I saw you guys went on a date yesterday.

345
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:25,406
It wasn't a date.

346
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,336
I went with her as a friend.

347
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,176
Are you sure?

348
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:31,336
Yes.

349
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:36,206
It took me ages to make her forgive me after she found out that I was the one who brought you to the pub.

350
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,936
That other friend she's close with...

351
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,176
Is it a girl or a boy?

352
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,086
A girl.

353
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:49,656
Her name is...

354
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:51,006
Khun Nueng!

355
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,726
It's really you!

356
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:55,636
Hello, professor.

357
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:56,086
Hello.

358
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,996
Well... please excuse me.

359
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:02,926
I want to talk to you.

360
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:03,606
Please sit.

361
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,966
How have you been?

362
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:10,716
We're looking for a special lecturer.

363
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:14,526
If a person like you applies, our faculty will definitely accept you.

364
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:15,676
Are you interested?

365
00:36:16,756 --> 00:36:17,666
Not really.

366
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,586
I don't like being tied down to a fixed schedule at work.

367
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:24,016
But as a special lecturer, you don't have to stick to a set schedule like the full-time teachers do.

368
00:36:24,746 --> 00:36:26,286
I still don't like that.

369
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,766
Anyway, how are you doing?

370
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:44,846
Let's go talk somewhere else.

371
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:46,636
There're too many people here.

372
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:48,156
It's uncomfortable.

373
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:50,806
Let's go. I want to introduce you to the head of my faculty.

374
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:58,516
Who's that?

375
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:00,116
She's so pretty.

376
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,116
Khun Nueng, you're going to be a special lecturer at a university?

377
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:29,206
Thank you.

378
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:35,286
I'm not sure if I can tolerate all the restrictions.

379
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,906
It's such a huge burden being a teacher, you know, Tuo Lek.

380
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:40,106
Imagine me fighting with kids these days.

381
00:37:40,106 --> 00:37:42,106
Just thinking about that gives me a headache.

382
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:46,016
But you're not the type of person who just sits around and does nothing.

383
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:47,306
Aren't you bored?

384
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:49,876
Of course I'm bored. I'm so bored.

385
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:53,586
I spent my whole life going against my grandma.

386
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,526
I don't even know why I did that.

387
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,026
Such a waste of time.

388
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,286
It's already in the past.

389
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:02,496
What's important is now.

390
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:04,846
Thank you so much.

391
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,776
Thank you.

392
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,136
But it's such a shame.

393
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:13,516
You rejected all the offers.

394
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,826
You're so talented.

395
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,906
It's a waste of your skills.

396
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:26,906
Actually, I want to open a small gallery.

397
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:32,856
So that the artists can exhibit their works, and we can organize some art workshops.

398
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:34,386
That's great.

399
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,016
I will find a place for you.

400
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:40,586
Do you have in mind how many floors you would like to have?

401
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:47,206
I want to have a spacious area, lots of white space.

402
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:53,666
There must be enough space for me to divide it into different sections for teaching arts and drawing.

403
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:57,616
Wait, didn't you say teaching is tiring?

404
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,616
It's not the same thing, Mon.

405
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:05,176
I want to teach my students with passion. I don't want to force them.

406
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:08,096
That would be too boring.

407
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:15,366
That's a good idea. I will invite my friends who are influencers to give us reviews when we open the gallery.

408
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:21,806
I'm on board with that! Arts and crafts are super trendy right now, so I bet it'll be fun.

409
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:27,646
I'm glad that you finally get to do what you like.

410
00:39:28,696 --> 00:39:30,306
I'm happy for you.

411
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,346
Thank you.

412
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:56,186
What do you think?

413
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:57,976
Do you like it?

414
00:39:58,786 --> 00:39:59,976
It looks nice, don't you think so?

415
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:00,986
I did such a good job.

416
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:02,226
Of course.

417
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,386
By the way, how's your girl doing?

418
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,216
I don't know. I haven't talked to her.

419
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,766
Did something happen?

420
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:17,466
Nothing.

421
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:23,396
She just entered university, so she's kinda addicted to her friends these days. That's all.

422
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:27,486
Khun Nueng, do you know why she keeps her distance from you?

423
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:28,956
Tuo Lek.

424
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:30,966
What are you implying?

425
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:33,246
I'm just worried about you.

426
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:42,016
(Chet)

427
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,826
What's up?

428
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:48,256
Huh?

429
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:53,906
Calm down. I'll be there as fast as I can, okay?

430
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:06,976
Do you usually hang out, just the two of you?

431
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:09,226
No.

432
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:15,246
Usually, we hang out with Folk too. But he's in a different faculty, so our schedules don't really match.

433
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:16,629
Are you a tomboy?

434
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:17,976
You like girls, don't you?

435
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:20,026
I'm not a tomboy.

436
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:21,416
I am queer.

437
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:23,676
It's the same thing.

438
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:25,076
No, it's not.

439
00:41:26,846 --> 00:41:27,386
Chet.

440
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:35,586
Ar-Nueng, what are you doing here?

441
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:42,386
Your dad called me. He said he has something to talk to me about, so he asked me to come here.

442
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:51,476
Oh, you're Yui, right? Chet told me about you.

443
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:53,386
Yes.

444
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:55,956
She's your friend?

445
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,476
We're more that just friends.

446
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,286
We're talking.

447
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:12,866
Are you both studying the same major?

448
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:14,116
That's right.

449
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:17,916
How did you two become close?

450
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:23,906
We met during the orientation activity. We became closer because we're also in the same club.

451
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:26,286
I see.

452
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:32,616
What about you? How are you? It's been a while.

453
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,866
I'm good. I have Yui with me.

454
00:42:38,276 --> 00:42:39,826
She helps me with everything.

455
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:48,046
That's great.

456
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:57,446
It's okay if you two want to be together as long as you both still study hard and also do things in your parents' presence.

457
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:01,276
I think that's cute.

458
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,196
Don't worry.

459
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,696
Anueng is smart.

460
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,646
Actually, we're both are good students.

461
00:43:11,176 --> 00:43:12,056
Wow.

462
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:14,556
That's great.

463
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:20,106
I'm not surprised why Anueng is dating you.

464
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:25,246
Good, this makes me feel so relieved.

465
00:43:30,086 --> 00:43:32,406
Please look after her for me.

466
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:33,866
I will.

467
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,709
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

468
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:52,606
You guys feel free to chitchat. I'll be right back.

469
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:53,866
Okay.

470
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:15,436
You're not acting like yourself.

471
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:18,836
What do you want me to do?

472
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:20,476
You want me to give them a round of applause?

473
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:25,826
I called you because I wanted you to stop them, not to encourage them.

474
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:29,316
I don't think there's anything wrong. It's quite cute, actually.

475
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:32,509
That girl is a tomboy! She's dating a tomboy!

476
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:37,586
So what? You want her to date a guy and risk getting pregnant accidentally instead?

477
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:38,626
Khun Nueng.

478
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:42,426
I just want you to get the whole picture.

479
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,216
I want you to see that there's nothing wrong with dating a girl.

480
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:51,402
Anueng should have the freedom to live her life.

481
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,406
You don't understand.

482
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:57,189
The problem is I cannot accept the fact that my daughter is gay.

483
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:00,282
Why does this have to happen to my daughter?

484
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:04,056
Khun Nueng.

485
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:08,676
Can you please tell Anueng that this is not normal?

486
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:11,256
Please, help me.

487
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:14,906
Tell her yourself.

488
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:18,109
Anueng listens to you. I want you to tell her that for me.

489
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,166
No.

490
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:25,596
I won't say anything.

491
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:30,436
Whatever she chooses to do, I will support her.

492
00:45:31,746 --> 00:45:37,086
If you want to get closer to your daughter, you have to respect her decision.

493
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:43,796
But what you did today is far from trying to get closer to your own daughter.

494
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:45,756
What you did...

495
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:48,626
It's more like you want to push her away.

496
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:58,286
Thank you.

497
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:04,486
Where's dad?

498
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,306
Oh, he's got some errands to do.

499
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:12,176
Are you guys the same age?

500
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:14,526
No, I'm younger than Anueng.

501
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:15,669
I see.

502
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:20,206
Ar-Nueng, how old are you?

503
00:46:23,736 --> 00:46:24,686
I'm thirty...

504
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:26,576
Thirty-six years old.

505
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:29,186
Whoa.

506
00:46:30,056 --> 00:46:32,066
You don't look like you're thirty-six years old.

507
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:34,322
You look younger than thirty years old.

508
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:38,496
How old did you think I was?

509
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:41,136
Around the early twenties.

510
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,509
You're more like a sister rather than an auntie.

511
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:50,789
You can call me 'sister.'

512
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,916
That's not nice, Anueng.

513
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,349
If I'm not lovable, then don't love me

514
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:14,362
I'm so sorry.

515
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:15,926
Anueng!

516
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:17,126
Anueng!

517
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,606
Khun Nueng, you're actually so scary.

518
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:25,886
Please don't do that to me. I promise you I will be a good girl.

519
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:32,909
Anueng is quite amazing for making you like this.

520
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:34,806
Like what?

521
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,109
Jealous.

522
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:38,786
I'm not. You're talking nonsense, Tuo Lek.

523
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:40,956
Why are you denying it?

524
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:43,446
It's so obvious that you're flirting with Yui

525
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:47,246
I bet she falls head over heels for you now.

526
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,646
Aren't you afraid that you and Anueng will get into a fight?

527
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:55,566
I'll find out this evening.

528
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,866
Khun Nueng.

529
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:08,666
You have a guest.

530
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:19,156
I just finished cooking curry. Please help me with the rest.

531
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:19,936
Understood, Khun Nueng.

532
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:32,326
Follow me.

533
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,636
It's obvious that you intended to flirt with Yui in front of me today.

534
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:47,666
Really?

535
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,626
I did that?

536
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:51,346
I didn't realize.

537
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,116
Why did you do that?

538
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:55,666
You never did something like that.

539
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:57,486
How did you know that I never did that?

540
00:49:00,276 --> 00:49:03,426
Maybe I did it before. You just didn't know.

541
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:05,676
Why are you like this?

542
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:11,316
Actually...

543
00:49:12,736 --> 00:49:14,506
I think Yui is cute.

544
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:17,556
But Yui likes me.

545
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:21,666
You'll find out whether she will still like you or not.

546
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:26,196
What are you planning to do?

547
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:30,906
I don't believe that you're actually interested in Yui.

548
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:35,642
You think you know me that well?

549
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:37,856
I know you really well.

550
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,766
I know everything about you.

551
00:49:41,696 --> 00:49:42,496
Really?

552
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,166
You're mean!

553
00:49:49,796 --> 00:49:52,176
Why do you have to hurt my feelings this badly?

554
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:55,266
After what we did...

555
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:56,216
We did what?

556
00:49:57,736 --> 00:49:58,506
Ar-Nueng!

557
00:49:59,522 --> 00:50:00,906
What did we do?

558
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:03,656
You know what I mean!

559
00:50:06,026 --> 00:50:07,029
There's something

560
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,436
between us?

561
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:28,376
Ar-Nueng, you're so unfair! You know I will lose to you anyway.

562
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:32,916
Why did you not get jealous at all?

563
00:50:34,426 --> 00:50:36,162
If I go out with someone else,

564
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:39,496
you won't feel anything, right?

565
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,716
How do you know that I won't feel anything?

566
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:06,746
How do you know...

567
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:10,106
that I won't get jealous?

568
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:21,006
Stop smiling.

569
00:51:30,146 --> 00:51:32,676
Auntie Nim, you can take a rest. I'll take care of this.

570
00:51:33,316 --> 00:51:34,316
Alright, Khun Nueng.

571
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:39,666
Sit down.

572
00:51:57,876 --> 00:51:58,562
Have a taste.

573
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:09,242
How is it?

574
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:10,816
Is it good?

575
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:15,896
It's so yummy.

576
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,136
There're so many different ways to show your love.

577
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:28,176
For example...

578
00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:32,536
Cooking.

579
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:40,229
I'm too old to do what young people do.

580
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:44,242
Being jealous all the time is not my style.

581
00:52:47,256 --> 00:52:49,109
I want to be with someone I feel comfortable with.

582
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:50,989
Stay if you like,

583
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:54,076
and if you don't like then it's okay too.

584
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:02,896
Why are you staring at me?

585
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,596
What else are you curious about?

586
00:53:08,356 --> 00:53:09,686
Do you really love me?

587
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,436
You're asking me

588
00:53:28,016 --> 00:53:29,166
because you want the answer

589
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:31,122
or you want me to prove it.

590
00:53:35,636 --> 00:53:37,416
What if I want both?

591
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:43,136
Alright.

592
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:28,226
Does this prove it already?

593
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:34,086
Not yet.

594
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:11,156
I miss you so much.

595
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:19,926
Why didn't you come see me if you miss me?

596
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,309
You didn't call me.

597
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,246
Let's just forget about it.

598
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:32,736
Right now, I want to focus only on you.

599
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:45,486
Good.

600
00:55:47,396 --> 00:55:50,196
From now on, we won't reset anything.

601
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:54,796
Tonight, you will know

602
00:55:57,046 --> 00:55:58,636
how much I love you.

603
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:38,829
This is Anueng.

604
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:39,676
Hello.

605
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:40,956
She is...

606
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:45,476
She's Piangfa's daughter. Piangfa is my friend.

607
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:51,469
I know that you're not ready to tell others about us and you don't want me to move in with you, right?

608
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,802
I understand.

609
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:55,202
But that doesn't mean I don't feel sad.

610
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:57,029
You're reading this kind of novel?

611
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:00,602
What is this? A lesbian novel?

612
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:04,069
Mr. Chet, please let me borrow Khun Nueng for a moment.

613
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:04,829
Sure.

614
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:07,256
Why do they have to talk so closely to each other?

615
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:09,536
Can't they stay apart?

616
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:12,722
You have to be mine, only mine.

617
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,296
You want that?

618
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,820
