2
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,500
Nueng, you broke your promise.

3
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
You promised that you'd do whatever it took, 

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,000
To make Anueng come and live with me.

5
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,480
But after Anueng spoke to you,

6
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
She now tells me she that won't live with me.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,239
Why didn't you keep your promise?

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Anueng was extremely upset,

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
At the thought of being forced to move away.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,617
What did you expect me to do?

11
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,240
Are you saying that she won't go,

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Because she loves you more than her own mother?

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,720
How dare you do this?

14
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:20,758
Aren't you ashamed to love someone else's daughter?

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,250
What 'love'?

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,720
Be careful with what you say.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,274
It's true!

18
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,720
If you want a daughter, then you should give birth yourself.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
She's my daughter.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,240
So …

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,720
From now on, I won't allow Anueng to see you.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,720
It's just weird.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,720
That she would love a stranger more than her own mother.

24
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,000
It's not weird.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Have you ever comforted your daughter?

26
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,480
When you're here, you're completely self-centred.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You haven't even asked her if she wants to live with you.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,240
If she has to move overseas, how will she adjust?

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
And one more thing.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,479
Did you even once come back and visit her?

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,729
That's the reason.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
You seems to have a lot to say.

33
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
I know what you're trying to do.

34
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,261
Let me make this clear.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,240
I forbid you from seeing my daughter again,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Until I can patch things up with Anueng.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Goodbye!

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Happy birthday.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,000
You didn't give me a cake.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
But you gave me a gift.

41
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,000
Sam, why didn't you tell me you were coming?

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to take you for a meal.

43
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,255
I've already made reservations.

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Just a meal?

45
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,283
Hmm … yes.

46
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,719
I can invite you for a mean can't I?

47
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,240
OK. I'll just wear this.

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
That won't be a problem, right?

49
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,480
Why are you standing?

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Have a seat.

51
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't blame Sam.

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,000
I told her to bring you here.

53
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:36,000
Grandma wants to talk to you about something,

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,720
Nueng, please just listen for a moment.

55
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you afraid to talk to me?

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Don't worry about the price.

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.

58
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you back together with Chet now?

59
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,479
We just happened to meet by chance.

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,000
So we went to that event together.

61
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:02,480
Are you sure it wasn't it to prove yourself to Anueng's grandma?

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
For that girl,

63
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,240
You were willing to put in that much effort.

64
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,480
I never put myself out for anyone.

65
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
I raised you from a baby.

66
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,746
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

67
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,226
Do you have feelings for that girl?

68
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,000
Didn't you like it?

69
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
I really don't want a new outfit.

70
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,480
But if you want to get yourself something, I'm happy to wait.

71
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
These aren't for me. They're for you.

72
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Sam didn't say anything to me.

73
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,000
When you hugged that girl, everyone there saw it.

74
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:08,030
If I do have feelings for that girl, what's the problem?

75
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
Is it appropriate?

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,240
You know perfectly well what is right and wrong.

77
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,960
Every single thing about me,

78
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,719
Is something you consider inappropriate.

79
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,479
What's the problem if I add one more thing?

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,729
Sam is also in … a relationship with a woman.

81
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It was not easy for me to accept that.

82
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Will you also be like Sam?

83
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,000
How is this any of your business?

84
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
Grandma. Do not forget,

85
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I do not submit to your authority anymore.

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,480
You're a disgrace.

87
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
Have you no shame at all?

88
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
It's OK mum.

89
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't need to come into the fitting room with me.

90
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,720
I can dress myself.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,720
No need to be shy.

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
No Mum. I said no!

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
I didn't even want to come here with you.

94
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
Hey, Anueng!

95
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,000
Even though you've moved out of home,

96
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't forget,

97
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,720
If you're born a swan, you must live like a swan.

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
You don't even try to understand.

99
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
My sister died.

100
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,076
Do you even feel any remorse about that?

101
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
That you destroyed two granddaughter's lives?

102
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
That's unfair, Nueng.

103
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Really?

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,720
I think I'm being too soft.

105
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,720
From what I've seen, grandma has never regretted anything.

106
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,016
If grandma had some empathy,

107
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:49,719
We might have been able to live normal lives.

108
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
Nueng, that enough.

109
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Let her speak her mind.

110
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,000
One day you'll understand that living like that,

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Is totally pointless.

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
My pointless life, as you call it, 

113
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,000
Makes me happier than when I lived with you in your fancy house.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
At least ...

115
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I can live my own life.

116
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Live you own life?

117
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,000
While begging your sister for money?

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
You don't get to say you're living your own life.

119
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,720
You're being a hypocrite.

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Hey.

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
What?

122
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Huh?

123
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Thank you for your concern.

124
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:02,000
But I have never once regretted moving out of home.

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Nueng.

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
I thought I'd find you here.

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,480
Why is your phone switched off?

128
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Everyone is worried about you.

129
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
If you mean mum and grandma, I don't care.

130
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
I mean me.

131
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,699
You can't just run away every time.

132
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Come with me.

133
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Where are you taking me?

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want to go.

135
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,480
I want to talk about Anueng.

136
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,720
She doesn't want to go to America with you.

137
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Anueng has no right to decide.

138
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm her mother.

139
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
I know what's best for her.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You also have no right to decide.

141
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,720
I raised Anueng myself.

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
I have the right to decide for her.

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Mother,

144
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I want my daughter to have a bright future.

145
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,720
She will have a comfortable life in America.

146
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
She won't have to struggle

147
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
She doesn't have to struggle if she stays here.

148
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,480
And one more thing.

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
If Anueng lives with you, will she become like you?

150
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
We should ask Anueng.

151
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,480
Ask what she wants to do.

152
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I want to keep things how they are.

153
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
You live with your husband.

154
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,480
And I stay here with grandma.

155
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
In Anueng moves to America,

156
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
She has to adapt to a new culture.

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
If she stays here,

158
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
She has her friends,

159
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,726
And her grandma.

160
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,000
But its not only about that.

161
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I want a chance to live with my daughter.

162
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,480
As her mother.

163
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,240
But I don't want to go with you.

164
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:58,720
Can't you give me a chance?

165
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,480
But … its just so weird.

166
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,000
You never wanted to see me.

167
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
And you suddenly return and act like you love me so much.

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
And you want me to pretend that I'm close to you.

169
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,240
And move to live with you.

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,240
And have a stepfather.

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A new home.

172
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Have you ever considered my feelings?

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
If you move to America,

174
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,720
You will have a bright future.

175
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
You'll have a good life.

176
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
And meet good people.

177
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Just like when your grandma sent me there.

178
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,331
I don't want to go.

179
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,720
I want to live with grandma.

180
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you concerned about Anueng's future?

181
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,260
Of course.

182
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,000
She'll get a better education in America.

183
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,720
If she moves there,

184
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,480
I believe she will be happy.

185
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,000
Hey … Anueng just said that she didn't want to go.

186
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
If you are concerned about her education and future,

187
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,492
If you agree …

188
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:20,000
I will volunteer to be responsible for her education.

189
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll do everything I can to make sure, 

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
That she gets into a good university.

191
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I quite adore Anueng.

192
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
Anueng is a good girl.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
Everyone knows this.

194
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,480
It's not just her education

195
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,240
I want to get close to my daughter.

196
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,480
Love can be expressed in many ways.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,720
If you love your daughter,

198
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
You need to listen to her.

199
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,000
And who's listening to me?

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,480
Why do you love my daughter so much?

201
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
What do you mean?

202
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,720
If you want a daughter, you should give birth yourself.

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
Why do have to steal my daughter?

204
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,000
It's Anueng who doesn't want to go with you.

205
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,720
I think Nueng can be a good role model for Anueng.

206
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:26,240
But mother …

207
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,000
You need to accept this.

208
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,508
You should enjoy your remaining time here with Anueng.

209
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,000
If you try to force her, she'll just hate you.

210
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,480
I'm thankful that you, that you care so much for Anueng.

211
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:48,479
If you take care of Anueng,

212
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm very confident,

213
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
That she will do well.

214
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you for you understanding.

215
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
I will keep my word,

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,240
So don't worry about her study.

217
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,000
I can see you cherish Anueng, so I feel comfortable.

218
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Thank you.

219
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
What are you up to?

220
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,480
Tell me what you're thinking.

221
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,720
That you shouldn't act like this.

222
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,495
Do you know, 

223
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right now,

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,480
You're blushing.

225
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,000
Have you ever been in love?

226
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
My younger sister.

227
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,720
I love her very much.

228
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,720
I mean …

229
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
Sexual love.

230
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,019
(cough)

231
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,480
No one yet.

232
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,480
No one is worthy.

233
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Also you … little girl,

234
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
Are not worthy.

235
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,480
I keep telling you,

236
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That one day I will be worthy.

237
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't want to do any more homework.

238
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,720
I'll read my novel instead.

239
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,730
Finish your homework first.

240
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:00,000
No, I'm too lazy.

241
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,240
I made a promise to your grandma and mother.

242
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
If your results aren't good enough to get into university.

243
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
The deal is you will then go and live with your mother.

244
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,720
Why did my mother insist on that?

245
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,720
The more she pushes me, the more I will refuse.

246
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,720
No one gets everything they want.

247
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Finish your homework first.

248
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
Then you can do whatever you want.

249
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
Do whatever I want, you say?

250
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes

251
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,145
So ...

252
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,331
Can I kiss you on your cheek?

253
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Huh?

254
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,720
Kiss your cheek.

255
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
No, you can't.

256
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
Then I'm not doing any more. It's boring.

257
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,995
Awww.

258
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,390
If I can't kiss your cheek,

259
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,039
Then even if I earn a Doctorate Degree,

260
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:04,000
My life will remain unfulfilled.

261
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:09,240
How is kissing a cheek related to earning a Doctorate?

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's definitely related.

263
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,720
If I can't kiss the cheek of the person I love,

264
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What's the point of being successful in life?

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
Then you can go and live with your mother.

266
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
OK, I'll go and live with my mother.

267
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
OK

268
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
Do your homework,

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What's that?

270
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,720
Do your homework,

271
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
Awww.

272
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,480
Your cheek is so soft.

273
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
If I can kiss you some more,

274
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll probably top all my subjects.

275
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't you expect me to let you do anything more.

276
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You'll eventually let me do more.

277
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh.

278
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,720
I just remembered.

279
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,720
I still have Thai language homework.

280
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't you expect to kiss my check again.

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,833
Thai language homework?

282
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,480
I wonder where it could be?

283
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,720
Oh, I just found my Thai language homework.

284
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
Have you thought about what you want to study at uni?

285
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,000
I want to study communications.

286
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,480
Communications?

287
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,240
Yes.

288
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,720
What do you want to do when you graduate?

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
I want to be an announcer.

290
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
 I like speaking. Using my voice.

291
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,509
Doing voice work takes more skill than you would expect.

292
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
But you will have many competitors.

293
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
It may be hard for you to get a job.

294
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm not concerned about that.

295
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,480
Can't I study what I enjoy?

296
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
No. You can't.

297
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
It has no future.

298
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,000
Believe me.

299
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,480
You should study statistics or law.

300
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,000
Just like your father.

301
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
Then you should study a Master's Degree overseas.

302
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
You're not reasonable.

303
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
Dictator.

304
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,240
No. I want to study Architecture.

305
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why would you design a house for someone else?

306
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
You should study economics or business administration.

307
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,195
I don't like those.

308
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,480
I want to study architecture.

309
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,480
I like design.

310
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
I know that's what you like.

311
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,240
But stop thinking like an ordinary person.

312
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,720
You aren't ordinary.

313
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,720
You need to be perfect.

314
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
You need to control everything, right?

315
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Dictator!

316
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Miss Nueng.

317
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,493
Why do you want to be an announcer?

318
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,720
I don't like working with people.

319
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
It's exhausting pretending to be happy all the time.

320
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:53,257
Do you often pretend to be happy?

321
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sometimes.

322
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
When I'm sad,

323
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
I don't want to show people.

324
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:02,240
So I just smile.

325
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
When you're with me from now on,

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You don't have to pretend to be happy.

327
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,000
However you feel,

328
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,240
Just express your emotions.

329
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
If I get mad at you,

330
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
Won't you be annoyed with me?

331
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
I wouldn't dare do that.

332
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
You can do it.

333
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
I want you to.

334
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,240
When you're annoyed, you should do the same.

335
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,480
When you're annoyed, you should frown.

336
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
When you're angry, you should yell.

337
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
It's weird.

338
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
We're asking each other to make loud noises.

339
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
Weird, right?

340
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
It will help us to become closer.

341
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Huh?

342
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Sharing negative emotions with each other?

343
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This will make us closer?

344
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Positive emotions which are fake,

345
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Will only disappoint in the end.

346
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,720
From now on, we share the good and the bad.

347
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,240
This is how we get to know each other better.

348
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you just want to come back to collect something,

349
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,480
There's no need for you to be sneaky.

350
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,720
You're acting like this isn't your home.

351
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,480
This isn't my home.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Nueng, grandma is sick now.

353
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,480
Sam. No need to tell me that.

354
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't care what's wrong with her.

355
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Nueng, you need to understand,

356
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
That grandma is getting old these days.

357
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Hey Sam, listen to me.

358
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Grandma will not easily get sick and die. Believe me.

359
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,240
If grandma isn't around anymore,

360
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,720
Will you regret you weren't nicer to her?

361
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
Aww. I have to go.

362
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Nueng.

363
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,720
I'll drive you home.

364
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,240
No need. I can get home myself.

365
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
Grandma loves you very much.

366
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
And I want you to ...

367
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,954
To reconcile with grandma?

368
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
Yes.

369
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,000
You heard what grandma said to me at the restaurant?

370
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Did it sound like she wanted to reconcile?

371
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Nueng.

372
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,000
While grandma is still alive,

373
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I won't set foot back here again.

374
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You don't have to drive me home.

375
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I'm considerate.

376
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I have to go.

377
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,000
"Marisa once made a deal with Satan, that …"

378
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
"I secretly agreed with Satan."

379
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,480
"Money and fame didn't matter to me."

380
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,240
I would never make a promise like this.

381
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,240
Because I know what is important in my life.

382
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I'll never allow Satan to take it away.

383
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
Miss Nueng. Do you know what is important to me?

384
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,480
It's you Miss Nueng.

385
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
I love you Miss Nueng.

386
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,240
"Marissa took the initiative"

387
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,000
"Using her instincts to lead"

388
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,240
"Her hands slowly climbed into the placket front of the shirt, and …"

389
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,720
Ouch

390
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,720
That hurt Miss Nueng.

391
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
I was supposed to.

392
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Scenes like this.

393
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,720
You shouldn't read them aloud.

394
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,240
I'm just reading the novel.

395
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:31,480
You shouldn't have hit me.

396
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
You should read your textbook.

397
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
Aww Miss Nueng.

398
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
You said I could ask for one thing.

399
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Take me travelling so I don't have to read my textbook.

400
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,000
I brought you here,

401
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
As a reward for studying diligently.

402
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,000
But since you arrived, you've been lazy.

403
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,480
If you don't get into university, don't blame me.

404
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,480
Oh Miss Nueng, wait a minute.

405
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,720
Why did you take my book?

406
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,480
I don't allow you to … read such scenes.

407
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
Don't tell me you're … blushing.

408
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
Who's blushing?

409
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,720
You're delusional.

410
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,240
If you're not blushing, why are you walking away?

411
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:34,737
I'm just putting this novel away.

412
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:37,817
So you can focus on your textbook.

413
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
I saw it.

414
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
You were blushing.

415
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
Get back to your study,

416
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,240
If you don't get good scores on the exercises,

417
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,720
You'll miss out on going to the market street tonight.

418
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,240
[Piangfa calling]

419
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What?

420
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,240
How's my daughter?

421
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,000
She's good. She's reading her textbook.

422
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,240
It's a pity I can't be there with her.

423
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I can't be helped.

424
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,720
Anueng really needed a break.

425
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,720
If you were here too,

426
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
She would be even more stressed.

427
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,720
Nueng, I hope you know what a a lucky person you are.

428
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,720
My mother trusts you to take Anueng for a trip to the sea.

429
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,726
I hope you will be a good role model for my daughter.

430
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Don't disappoint me or my mother.

431
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,480
OK

432
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,240
I always keep my word.

433
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
You don't need to worry.

434
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,719
Miss Nueng. Let's go down to the water.

435
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,719
You go. I'll wait here.

436
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What are you doing?

437
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,479
Me? I'm not doing anything.

438
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,000
Anueng … Anueng!

439
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
There's a sunglasses shop.

440
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
That restaurant looks delicious.

441
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
Come in.

442
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
What's the matter?

443
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:32,480
Can't you sleep?

444
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,720
I'm scared.

445
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,479
Sleeping in a strange place.

446
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,000
Can I sleep with you?

447
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
OK

448
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,515
Sleeping with Miss Nueng is so exciting.

449
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Let's sleep.

450
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,720
What are you doing?

451
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
When you sleep with your back to me,

452
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
It's like I'm here all alone.

453
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,720
You're a pest.

454
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
What do you want?

455
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,000
Can you hug me?

456
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,000
Is it appropriate?

457
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
But I really can't sleep.

458
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,720
Please?

459
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
If I hug you,

460
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
You'll go to sleep?

461
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,480
What's the matter?

462
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You said if I hug you, you will go to sleep.

463
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm not used to it yet.

464
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,000
I'll probably fall asleep soon.

465
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,480
I feel so warm when I hug you.

466
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:58,000
When I say I love you.

467
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,480
Do you believe me?

468
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,480
You say it so often I don't want to believe you.

469
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,250
But I do believe you.

470
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,001
So that means,

471
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I still have hope, right?

472
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Time to sleep.

473
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:44,000
Can't you love me too?

474
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,480
