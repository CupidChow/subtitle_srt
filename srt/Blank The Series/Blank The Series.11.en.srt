1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,653
Khun Nueng, I forgot my phone.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,360
I just realized I forgot my phone.

3
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,826
Can you go get the phone for me?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,586
Did you drive far before realizing it?

5
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,200
Just a little bit.

6
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:30,133
I remembered, so I rushed back.

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,080
Are you staying here tonight?

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,400
Yes.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,586
When will you go home?

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,933
The semester will be over in 2 weeks.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,413
I'm leaving now.

12
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,440
Don't stay up too late.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,306
Okay.

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,693
Please take care of Anueng for me.

15
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,600
My boyfriend confessed two months ago

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,920
that he has to marry another woman his mother wants him to.

17
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,253
Why did you turn it off?

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,186
It's getting fun.

19
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:32,760
How is this supposed to be fun?

20
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,866
Other people's issues sound fun to you?

21
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,173
I've been listening with you for a while, and it's all about stealing each other's lovers, like in soap operas.

22
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,986
I think the real story is more fun than the soap operas.

23
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,933
How so?

24
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,213
Ar-Nueng...

25
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:50,786
What?

26
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:53,733
I just don't understand.

27
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:58,573
Why do we have to share our own issues on the radio?

28
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,906
Um...

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,666
I think it's more comfortable.

30
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,120
I like it too.

31
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,306
Sometimes, it makes you think.

32
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:12,573
How?

33
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,813
When it comes to love, every couple has their own issues.

34
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,453
It's up to them whether they will hold hands and fight through them or not.

35
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,933
What about you?

36
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,893
Will you fight for it with me?

37
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,120
Oh, Ar-Nueng. I don't think my dad saw anything this evening.

38
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,533
Because he talked to us naturally.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,440
Are you worried about it?

40
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:53,013
A little bit.

41
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:57,866
Why do we have to worry about this kind of stuff?

42
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,320
This is your house.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,786
Don't say that.

44
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,560
We shouldn't do something like that in plain sight.

45
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:15,520
But we're in the bedroom now.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,306
No one can see us.

47
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,466
What are you going to do?

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,040
You're so naughty.

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,906
Why won't you stop?

50
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,226
You're naughty.

51
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:32,733
Let's listen now.

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,760
Are you sure you didn't forget anything?

53
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,053
No, it's just...

54
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,280
What?

55
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:00,946
Nueng.

56
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:04,600
You promised me that you wouldn't do this again.

57
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:08,013
No one will see us.

58
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:09,973
It's just...

59
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,440
Just a kiss one the cheek.

60
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,800
One last time, okay?

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,453
You're not going to kiss me back?

62
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:22,773
What?

63
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:25,826
Nueng.

64
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,253
If you don't do it, I won't go to class.

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,613
I will sit here.

66
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,306
Nueng.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,786
Oh my, it's getting late. I'll be scolded.

68
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,813
Gosh! You're so naughty.

69
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:47,533
You're too far.

70
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,800
Am I close enough?

71
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,106
Go to class now.

72
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,306
I will go now.

74
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,613
What do you want to eat for dinner? I'll ask auntie Nim to prepare it for you.

75
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,946
Can I have crab meat curry with fermented rice noodles? It's been a while since I had it.

76
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,066
Sure.

77
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:32,653
That's great.

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
I want to eat it too.

79
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:41,493
Mom.

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,613
How come you're here?

81
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,400
What? Can't you guys be happier to see me?

82
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,373
I miss you so much.

83
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Give me a hug!

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,920
I haven't seen you for a while. You look so much more grown-up without your glasses.

85
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,893
You're as beautiful as I am!

86
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,140
When did you arrive here? You didn't tell me you were coming back.

87
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,160
It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

88
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,746
I miss my daughter.

89
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,840
My daughter is so beautiful. There must be a lot of people approaching you.

90
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,760
There are a few.

91
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,560
And?

92
00:07:58,506 --> 00:07:59,813
Do you have a boyfriend now?

93
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:05,573
Not yet.

94
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,946
So you don't like anyone?

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,106
I just want to tell you that

96
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,480
if you're going to date someone,

97
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,826
you should be with someone who is your equal.

98
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,960
And most importantly,

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
that person must be a man.

100
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,626
I have something to talk to Ar-Nueng.

101
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Go wait outside for just a moment.

102
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,853
Your gallery is beautiful.

103
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:07,960
Whatever it is, just say it.

104
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:11,333
I heard something strange from Chet.

105
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:13,493
About what?

106
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,280
There's something going on between you and Anueng.

107
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,013
What is it?

108
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Are you two dating?

109
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:34,773
You came back to ask me about this?

110
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,333
Actually, I really miss my daughter.

111
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,493
And when I heard about this, I had to hurry back.

112
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,613
So what's going between you two?

113
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:49,360
What do you want me to answer?

114
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,986
The truth.

115
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:52,666
Is it true?

116
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,360
Yes.

117
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,040
Anueng and I are dating.

118
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,106
Isn't this what you want to hear?

119
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,840
Khun Nueng, you can just say that it's not true.

120
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,693
I'm telling you the truth.

121
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,213
Don't you believe me?

122
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,320
Anueng and I, we are dating.

123
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
And we love each other very much.

124
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,893
- We have a relationship just like two women who love each other.
- Enough. That's enough!

125
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,880
I give up.

126
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,786
You don't have to be so sarcastic.

127
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:44,066
Just tell me that you two are not together and I will believe you.

128
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,066
Why don't you believe me?

129
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,053
How can I believe what you said?

130
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,626
A person like you will never like a girl like Anueng.

131
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:07,933
(Anueng)

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,186
I miss Ar-Nueng so much.

133
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:23,093
I was supposed to watch a series with you tonight.

134
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,600
You mom just came back.

135
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,653
You should spend time with her.

136
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,840
But it's such a pity.

137
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,520
I was planning to play something with you tonight.

138
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:38,133
Nueng, is your mom around?

139
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:39,533
Be careful.

140
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,573
She's not here.

141
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,040
I wouldn't dare to call you like this if she were here.

142
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,320
I miss you.

143
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,840
I miss your soft cheeks too.

144
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,066
Don't do this.

145
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,493
Do what?

146
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:03,893
Why are you still doing it?

147
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:08,093
You're still talking to me so sweetly and using that voice with me.

148
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,746
Why?

149
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:11,853
Are you shy?

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,866
No.

151
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,493
Stop using that voice because it makes me want to hug you right now.

152
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,880
We will see each other in 2 weeks.

153
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,720
How about this?

154
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,613
Close your eyes.

155
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,546
And think that I'm right there.

156
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:52,026
I don't know what's going on. Everything seems so chaotic!

157
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:57,426
Your dad must be really suspicious of us.

158
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,186
That's why he wanted your mom to come back very quickly

159
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,093
But...

160
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,546
There's no proof about us yet.

161
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,573
So what?

162
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
I love Ar-Nueng no matter what.

163
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,173
It's not that easy.

164
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,186
Why do we have to make it so hard?

165
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,573
I want to make everything easy.

166
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,013
But in reality, it's not.

167
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:28,853
Your dad, your mom, and your grandma, they all trust me.

168
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,253
And if they know that

169
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:34,986
you and I...

170
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:37,640
If they know that we are...

171
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,560
Ar-Nueng, you have to promise me.

172
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,866
Promise me that you won't leave me.

173
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,613
Why would I leave you?

174
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:46,533
I don't know.

175
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,133
I'm afraid.

176
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:55,266
Why are you so quiet?

177
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,213
Ar-Nueng!

178
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,253
I won't leave you.

179
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,813
Why would I do that?

180
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,640
Don't be afraid.

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,706
There is a way out for everything.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,813
Time's up for stressful moments.

183
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,933
Let's listen to the radio.

184
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,773
I don't have a radio.

185
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,946
We can use computers. People these days use computers now.

186
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,946
Oh, right, computers...

187
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,733
I don't want to listen to music.

188
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,973
Who said I would let you listen to music?

189
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,173
I will let you listen to my favorite station.

190
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,680
Nope.

191
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:39,826
I don't want to.

192
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,520
I told you I'm not into it.

193
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,573
You should listen to it when you feel stressed.

194
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,413
You'll learn that it's not just us who are facing problems. Others have them too.

195
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,520
But they can overcome it.

196
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,680
I won't listen.

197
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,013
Come on.

198
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:55,293
Ar-Nueng!

199
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,480
Okay, fine. I'll listen to it.

200
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:01,840
Oh, you don't read novels anymore?

201
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:03,426
Nope.

202
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,746
I got what I wanted already.

203
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,653
You're mine now.

204
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,706
So I quit reading.

205
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,293
You're so mischievous.

206
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,840
Alright, so what do you want me to listen to? Just turn it on.

207
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,819
I will let Anueng go live with Fah.

208
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:02,566
How could you do this to my daughter?

209
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:06,859
Now I know why you never accept my love.

210
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,059
In fact, you're just a gender deviant!

211
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:14,499
Chet!

212
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,392
You're such a liar!

213
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,192
You used the trust that Fah and I gave you to take care of Anueng.

214
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,592
And you tricked my daughter into doing something disgusting.

215
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:23,792
You're shameful!

216
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,806
I didn't trick her.

217
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,339
Anueng and I, we love each other.

218
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,032
So you admit it, huh?

219
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:37,939
We love each other.

220
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,792
What's wrong with that?

221
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:42,659
It is wrong! How can it not?

222
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,686
What's wrong with that?

223
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:45,926
Just say it!

224
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,472
What makes you think it's wrong?

225
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,592
You are a woman.

226
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,486
Two women can't love each other!

227
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:57,859
So it's about gender.

228
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,299
How can it not be possible?

229
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,552
Any gender can love one another.

230
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,032
Don't be so old-fashioned.

231
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:07,379
It's not just about gender.

232
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,339
You and my daughter are 16 years apart.

233
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,139
16 years!

234
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:18,632
So what?

235
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,646
It's not a problem for us.

236
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,352
We already talked about this.

237
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:30,312
You're unbelievable.

238
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:33,286
I understand that my daughter is still young.

239
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:39,619
But you, Ar-Nueng! You are so smart. You're perfect in every way. You are the eldest daughter of a noble family.

240
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,166
You're just...

241
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,192
You're unable to think.

242
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,286
My daughter is only 22 years old.

243
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,179
Her life has just begun.

244
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:51,859
But look at you!

245
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,179
In a few years, you will turn into an old granny!

246
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:55,486
Will you stop?

247
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,339
Don't you think that when you walk together, you're more like a mother and daughter than girlfriends?

248
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:00,979
Chet!

249
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:07,166
One day, when Nueng meets a man who's perfect for her, she will forget about you.

250
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:11,419
- And she will be annoyed that there's an old auntie being jealous around her.
- Enough!

251
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,059
Stop talking.

252
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,326
And get out.

253
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:20,446
Get out!

254
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:22,566
Can't you hear me?

255
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,819
Leave my daughter alone.

256
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,139
Khun Nueng.

257
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:24,952
When did you get here?

258
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:26,859
I just got here.

259
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,752
I'm here to ask for your understanding.

260
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,339
Please have a seat.

261
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,006
You know everything, right?

262
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:48,592
Yes.

263
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:51,966
At first, I didn't want to believe it.

264
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:59,459
Because I thought you would know better than anyone what's right and wrong.

265
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,926
Is it true love?

266
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:10,619
Or is it just a feeling of guilt that you almost caused Anueng not to be born?

267
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,179
Do you think I'm an unreliable person?

268
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,352
You know me better than that.

269
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,032
Hearing this makes me uncomfortable to say it.

270
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:29,979
But I have to say it.

271
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,152
I'm not here to separate you from my daughter.

272
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:39,392
But I want you to return my daughter to her family.

273
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,419
Can you do that?

274
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:45,526
How?

275
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:52,019
I want Anueng to study abroad.

276
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,312
I want her to live with me for 2-3 years.

277
00:20:56,926 --> 00:21:00,659
Let time prove whether everything will still be the same or not.

278
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,899
Can you do that?

279
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,966
You want your daughter to go live with you?

280
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:15,859
Yes.

281
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,792
To be honest, I want to say this as her mother.

282
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,699
I'm very shocked.

283
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:25,366
That my daughter is dating my own friend.

284
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:38,779
I'm sorry that everything turns out this way.

285
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:47,392
I'm her mother. I love my daughter even though I didn't raise her.

286
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:55,486
No mother would be happy to see her own daughter making a wrong decision.

287
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:11,286
What if, as time goes by, Anueng wants to date a girl?

288
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:18,659
If that's the case, I won't be against it anymore.

289
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,126
For you and Chet,

290
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:28,392
it can be anyone

291
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,646
but me, right?

292
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:31,686
That's right.

293
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,832
It can't be her father's ex-fiancée.

294
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,286
Or her mother's best friend.

295
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,432
And it can't be someone who Anueng's grandma trusts to be her role model.

296
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:49,086
Those are what you are, Khun Nueng.

297
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:58,579
I never thought that I would say this.

298
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,019
You don't deserve her.

299
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,059
Ar-Nueng.

300
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,366
Have a seat. I'll explain everything to you.

301
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,672
I talked to your mom.

302
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,152
She wants you to go and stay with her in the US.

303
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,286
What?

304
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:30,766
I won't go.

305
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:35,139
Nueng.

306
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:40,446
We all agreed that today we will talk like adults.

307
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,472
Can you listen

308
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:46,792
and be reasonable, like adults do?

309
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:57,886
Living abroad in the US is for your own good.

310
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:05,472
Staying away from me for 2-3 years might help you understand yourself more.

311
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,939
Why do I have to stay away from you?

312
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:11,846
For what?

313
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:18,312
Because...

314
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:24,219
Everyone here knows everything about us.

315
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:35,899
I won't go.

316
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,699
I won't go no matter what.

317
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:38,939
You can't do that.

318
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,632
You have to go and live with your mom.

319
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:43,219
You didn't even raise me. You have no right.

320
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:43,546
Nueng!

321
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:44,979
What about me?

322
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,592
Do I have the right?

323
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,286
Nueng, be reasonable.

324
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,899
We have to accept the truth.

325
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,606
This is my life.

326
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,486
This is my love.

327
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,966
It doesn't matter who doesn't understand.

328
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:16,899
Do you remember what I told you?

329
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:25,312
If you want everyone to accept our love, we can't run away from all the problems.

330
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:31,286
Everyone here...

331
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,872
They have reasons to disagree with us.

332
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,459
And I think they're right.

333
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:44,216
Ar-Nueng.

334
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,472
Your life is about to begin.

335
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,059
You still have a lot to see.

336
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,339
I want you to explore the world more.

337
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,566
So you will know that everything can change.

338
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,459
This again?

339
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,099
This reason again?

340
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,126
I understand.

341
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,926
I know everything.

342
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,872
I'm an adult now.

343
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,926
But what I understand the most

344
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,686
is my own feelings.

345
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:25,112
My heart will never change.

346
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,739
If you're so sure of that,

347
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:34,312
then prove it to everyone.

348
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:38,939
You will be away from me for only 2-3 years.

349
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:44,379
And if the day comes and we still love each other, then no one can do anything to us.

350
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,832
Do you really want me to go?

351
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:10,126
Is this really what you want?

352
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,099
Can you stand it?

353
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,832
Have you ever loved me?

354
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,686
All these times.

355
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:41,526
Is there anything real?

356
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:46,966
I don't know.

357
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:49,952
You don't know?

358
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,152
What does that mean?

359
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,059
It's actually good that you're going

360
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,206
so I can understand my own feelings.

361
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,726
You can think of it as giving me a chance.

362
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,579
I see.

363
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:18,876
So you're saying that you still don't know your own heart after all this time?

364
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:24,406
All these times we spent together

365
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:28,259
mean nothing to you?

366
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:35,912
You know what?

367
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,406
Right now, the person who should be by my side the most

368
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,046
is you, Ar-Nueng.

369
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:55,006
I'm very disappointed in you.

370
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:58,166
<i>♫ Have you ever loved me? ♫</i>

371
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,206
<i>♫ Every day, when we're close ♫</i>

372
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:10,886
<i>♫ What's the meaning behind those eyes ♫</i>

373
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:16,546
<i>♫ Don't leave it like this ♫</i>

374
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:23,046
<i>♫ Please tell me that your heart feels the same way ♫</i>

375
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:28,552
<i>♫ If you love me, please tell me so I can be sure ♫</i>

376
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:36,109
Thank you for doing what we've asked.

377
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:38,936
Your reason is understandable.

378
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:44,722
I have one more thing to ask.

379
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:50,469
Please don't contact Anueng until she goes to the US with me.

380
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,216
That's not what we agreed on.

381
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,416
I know.

382
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:03,616
But if you continue to contact her, Anueng might change her mind.

383
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:06,429
My mom will have to confiscate her phone.

384
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,402
Isn't that too much?

385
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,976
I'll talk to my mom again.

386
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:34,816
No need.

387
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,642
I don't think she wants to talk to me anymore.

388
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:45,149
<i>♫ How should it be? ♫ </i>

389
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:54,522
<i>♫ I'm unsure if we can call this love ♫</i>

390
00:31:54,526 --> 00:32:01,629
<i>♫ Countless times when you enter my life, so much happens between us ♫</i>

391
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:08,666
<i>♫ What lies between us? ♫</i>

392
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:15,376
<i>♫ All these good feelings ♫</i>

393
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:24,696
<i>♫ Is it right for me to feel this way? ♫</i>

394
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:32,629
<i>♫ What we have between us, I’m not sure if it’s wrong or not ♫</i>

395
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:38,682
<i>♫ Should I put an end to everything right now? ♫</i>

396
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:46,522
<i>♫ I don't know ♫</i>

397
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:51,096
<i>♫ What will become of us ♫</i>

398
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:58,336
<i>♫ Should I hold your hand or let you go? ♫</i>

399
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:06,989
<i>♫ I just realize how much love can hurt ♫</i>

400
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:13,776
<i>♫ Should I put an end to everything right now? ♫</i>

401
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:31,802
<i>♫ I don't want to shed tears ♫</i>

402
00:33:32,482 --> 00:33:40,989
<i>♫ Since the day you entered my life, you've changed me into someone new ♫</i>

403
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:48,736
<i>♫ I know that someday, you have to go, right? ♫</i>

404
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:54,576
<i>♫ Should I put an end to everything right now? ♫</i>

405
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:03,069
<i>♫ I don't know ♫</i>

406
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:07,469
<i>♫ What will become of us ♫</i>

407
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:14,589
<i>♫ Should I hold your hand or let you go? ♫</i>

408
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:23,136
<i>♫ I just realize how much love can hurt ♫</i>

409
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:29,829
<i>♫ Should I put an end to everything right now? ♫</i>

410
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:51,676
(I'm leaving tomorrow. I probably will never see you again. Goodbye)

411
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:14,122
What do you mean?

412
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:18,349
I mean what I say.

413
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:24,136
What do you mean by saying that you will never see me again?

414
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,322
I don't want to go with my mom.

415
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:37,002
Just the thought of not being able to see you.

416
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:40,882
I can't live like that.

417
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,216
I can't stand it.

418
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:50,509
I don't want to live anymore.

419
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:52,722
Nueng.

420
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,829
It's not a joke to say such a thing.

421
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:04,562
I'm completely broken.

422
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:09,336
Go with your mom.

423
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,282
When the time comes,

424
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:14,856
we will be together again.

425
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:24,989
You won't even try to stop me from leaving.

426
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,296
It's just me...

427
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:36,442
I'm the only one who keeps reminding you that I will always be by your side.

428
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:43,669
How can I believe in you?

429
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:52,842
How can I believe that when I come back, you will not change?

430
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:03,162
Grandma.

431
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:07,466
Khun Nueng, it seems like you understand everything.

432
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:09,949
But it looks like I was wrong.

433
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,936
Why do you have to make everything harder than it already is?

434
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,322
I'm just worried about Anueng.

435
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:20,736
She's leaving tomorrow.

436
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:23,616
That's enough, Khun Nueng.

437
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,949
You're an adult now.

438
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:27,936
Aren't you ashamed?

439
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:31,429
How would M.L. Khaekhai feel if she were still alive?

440
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:34,242
Oh.

441
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,069
I guess it doesn't matter.

442
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:41,202
Even if she were still around, you wouldn't feel anything, right?

443
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,109
My grandma has nothing to do with this.

444
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:47,416
I'm not a good person because of my own actions.

445
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:49,909
Alright.

446
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,442
I won't talk about anything else.

447
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:58,816
I just want one thing. Please leave my granddaughter alone.

448
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:05,816
I understand that you grew up without a father and a mother.

449
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:07,776
That's why you're like this.

450
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,962
Just the thought of not being able to see you.

451
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,842
I can't stand it.

452
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:03,169
I don't want to live anymore.

453
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:37,789
<i>♫ I don't know ♫</i>

454
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:42,669
<i>♫ What will become of us ♫</i>

455
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:49,895

457
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,815
Nueng.
<i>♫ I just realize how much love can hurt ♫</i>

458
00:39:51,815 --> 00:39:54,682
<i>♫ I just realize how much love can hurt ♫</i>

459
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:56,442
I'm completely broken too.
<i>♫ I just realize how much love can hurt ♫</i>

460

461
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:04,375

462
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:11,349
Anyone who wants to share your story, feel free to call us.

463
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:15,309
We will pick up the call after this break.

464
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:19,922
You're not alone in this sorrow. We're here to listen to you.

465
00:40:42,295 --> 00:40:44,282
What is your story, Khun A?

466
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,415
It all began during that time.

467
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:50,989
Ar-Nueng.

468
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:59,419
There was a girl who followed me every day after class.

469
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,442
At first, I didn't think much of it.

470
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:12,989
I simply thought she was a customer who wanted me to draw for her.

471
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:21,375
But that girl often came to ask me to draw for her.

472
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:30,549
It was normal for me to look at her face while I was drawing her.

473
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,735
She enjoyed making funny faces at me.

474
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:39,229
And she told me that I secretly liked her.

475
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:40,362
It was ridiculous.

476
00:41:46,149 --> 00:41:48,362
But she had very beautiful eyes.

477
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,882
When I looked into her eyes,

478
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,922
I felt like the world stopped spinning.

479
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:08,962
And she also had a very bright smile.

480
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:19,495
Perhaps it was her smile

481
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:23,375
and those eyes

482
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:27,455
that made her too adorable for me to push her away.

483
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:33,549
I found myself longing to be near her.

484
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,455
I didn't want her to disappear.

485
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:43,415
But she did disappear once.

486
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:49,322
I was unable to sleep that night.

487
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,042
I never felt like this with anyone.

488
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:57,829
But our love wasn't right.

489
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:03,015
Before I let go of her,

490
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:10,095
she asked me if I loved her.

491
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:16,815
It was a very easy question.

492
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:29,909
But I couldn't answer her.

493
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:39,602
You must be in a lot of pain, right?

494
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:44,469
Yes.

495
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:53,469
Actually, I know that I shouldn't have held her back.

496
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:58,215
Her life has just begun.

497
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:04,309
It's not fair to keep her to myself.

498
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:12,322
If she's listening right now, is there anything you want to tell her?

499
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:16,602
Nothing.

500
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:23,682
I have nothing to tell her.

501
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:26,789
If she's not listening,

502
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:29,055
do you want to say anything?

503
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:35,562
Khun A.

504
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:39,042
Why don't you try to be sincere with your own feelings?

505
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,309
Be honest with your heart.

506
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:50,255
Nueng.

507
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:55,202
I love you.

You wanted my daughter to come see you.

00:46:42,895 --> 00:46:45,709
She got hit by a car because of you!

537
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,069
How could you do that?

538
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:52,602
I don't know whether Anueng ever felt true happiness in her life or not.
