4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,542
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,919
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,338
Leave here right away.

7
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,506
You leave here first.

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,341
It's dangerous here.

9
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,761
They don't go easy
on rich and powerful people.

10
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,347
Take a picture of it
and send it to Junyoung.

11
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,016
They took my cell phone.

12
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,100
What?

13
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,561
They said
I should renounce the world first.

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,688
Why did you let them--

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,075
Gosh, it's too bright.

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,913
Oh, the switch was there. Jeez.

17
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,666
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,252
I felt hungry.

19
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,796
Do you have cup noodles?

20
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,805
You shouldn't be here without permission.

21
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,848
The door was open, so I just...

22
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,768
Okay. Where's the kitchen?

23
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,485
This way.

24
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,945
Okay, let's go.

25
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,911
The switch was right here.

26
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,007
- Why don't you begin to eat?
- It's not ready yet.

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,510
It takes three minutes.

28
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,225
You look strong.
How about working for me?

29
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,060
How much does Bori pay you?

30
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,207
"Lee Soeun, Lee Yeji"

31
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,036
"No plankton in stomach
Killed and thrown"

32
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,871
"Lee and Moon went
to the same college"

33
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,840
Here are the text message records.

34
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,640
Bori went to see
a plastic surgeon.

35
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,308
 I'll dig into it.

36
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
Be careful.

37
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,187
You, too.

38
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,441
Moon Dongsu seems
to have been following Bori.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,236
Why did he go
to see a plastic surgeon?

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,571
We'll find that out now.

41
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,657
How about you? Found out anything?

42
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,243
We got some pictures,

43
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,370
but it's hard to identify who are in them.

44
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,419
Excuse me.

45
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,514
These are fingerprints found
inside the Oryun Community.

46
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,975
Check them out.

47
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,605
How did you...

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,526
Mr. Jin sneaked into the community.

49
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777
He said

50
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,738
Ms. Lee is also in there.

51
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,366
You can't reach her.

52
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,159
They submitted their cell phones.

53
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,870
Then, how did you get these?

54
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,127
Sorry.

55
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,170
I can't tell you.

56
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,138
Check them out.

57
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,944
"Shin Woohyuk, Kim Yongcheol"

00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,950

59
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
Bring the list of new members.

60
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,184
Oh. Wait, please.

61
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,775
Here it is.

62
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,778
"List of New Members"

63
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,906
"GY Meditation Center Registration"

64
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,590
"Kim Jeongyeon
I should've told you earlier..."

65
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,303
Mr. Lee. It's me, Jeongyeon.

66
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,306
I'm digging into the Oryun Community.

67
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,851
I've been investigating
the key members of the community.

68
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,978
Now, I almost got to the clue.

69
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,730
- I'll reach you again.
-  Next up.

70
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,649
At around 9:30 a.m. on the 20th,

71
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,693
a 30-year-old man committed suicide

72
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,154
at a construction site
in Gangha-gu, Seoul.

73
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,698
The victim turned out to be a manager

74
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,867
of a cult named the Oryun Community.

75
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,953
In the suicide letter found at the scene,

76
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,538
the victim apologized

77
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,664
to his wife.

78
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,250
Kim Daeyeon reports at the site.

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,085
I'm at a construction site

80
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,920
in Gangha-gu, Seoul.

81
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
Why isn't she

82
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,508
- answering?
-  It's been over three months

83
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,302
since the construction stopped
due to lien issues.

84
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,596
At around 9:30 a.m. on the 20th,

85
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,974
Lee, the manager of the Oryun Community,

86
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,435
fell from this building to death.

87
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,061
At the site, his suicide letter

88
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
was found.

89
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,064
-  Let's eat.
- In the letter,

90
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,442
- he apologized to his wife...
-  Honey.

91
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,526
Why?

92
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,154
- What's up?
-  Seoul Gangha Police Station

93
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,197
assumes that Lee committed suicide

94
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,449
and suspects his death

95
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,950
was induced by a cult

96
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,828
called the Oryun Community.

97
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,123
The GY Meditation Center,
which is run by the Oryun Community,

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,542
was suspected to be the wirepuller

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,253
of mass suicide at a motel in 2022,

100
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,089
but it turned out
to have no relation to the case.

101
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,675
 Gangha Station

102
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,136
is investigating people around Lee

103
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,554
to find out why he died...

104
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,854
How may I help you?

105
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,648
This is my house.

106
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,067
Oh.

107
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,863
I got to the wrong place.

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,871
Huh?

109
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,251
What's this?

110
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,412
"Mass suicide in a motel
Investigation Report"

111
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,696
Excuse me.

112
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,742
Yes.

113
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,870
Honey.
We got a package here.

114
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,789
A package?
I'm not expecting anything.

115
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,167
I can't find the sender's name.

116
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,838
Just leave it. I'll go check it later.

117
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,922
I should get going.

118
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,049
Okay.

119
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,479
Hello. What's up?

120
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,481
We'll execute a warrant.

121
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,816
What?

122
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,152
- Warrant?
- Come in.

123
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey.

124
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,489
Excuse me?

125
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,032
Hey, wait.

126
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,307
Honey.

127
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,726
Where's Ganghyun? Where is she?

128
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,729
Something happened to her, right?

129
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,607
I'll be right back.

130
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,540
Who

131
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,500
sent that money?

132
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,921
You didn't decide who sent it
in your scenario yet?

133
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,798
I'll say it one more time.

134
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,134
I've never received money,

135
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,344
so, I don't know who sent it.

136
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,555
It's no use lying.

137
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,267
We have evidence here.

138
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,986
I think I know who made up this scenario,

139
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,198
and I'll definitely catch this one.

140
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,048
If you hold out like this,

141
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,009
who do you think will get hurt?

142
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,846
Your daughter has just been promoted

143
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,389
as a leader...

144
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,149
Father and daughter
worked in the same station,

145
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,401
so it's easy to make a story.

146
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,162
Think of it as an early retirement.

147
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,664
Resign by yourself.

148
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,137
How's Lee Seongwook's case going?

149
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,182
We'll close the case soon.

150
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,892
Is there anything to look into?

151
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,976
It's a suicide case.

152
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,023
Why do you care about this case
more than other ones?

153
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,775
It's already on the news.

154
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,693
I don't want to make it a big issue.

155
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,488
You know I don't like it.

156
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,449
I'll wrap it up soon.

157
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,034
Okay, go ahead.

158
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,139
You're not allowed to be here.

159
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,685
Do you know where Ganghyun is?

160
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,440
I can't reach her.

161
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,484
Answer me.

162
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,948
I heard the news that Lee Seongwook died.

163
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,743
Something's going on
in the Oryun Community, right?

164
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,203
Answer me.

165
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,332
We don't share anything--

166
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,417
Changun!

167
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,175
Ganghyun seems
to be investigating alone now.

168
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,468
You get it?

169
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,892
Get out, please.

170
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,945
Protect her.

171
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm asking you.

172
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,635
Sir.

173
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
Hey.

174
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,847
Where's Ganghyun now?

175
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,267
Mr. Park wouldn't tell me anything.

176
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,810
Where is she?

177
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,358
She's in the Oryun Community, right?

178
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
Yes, I guess so.

179
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,112
You guess?

180
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,657
You don't know
where exactly she is, either?

181
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,661
Maybe she has joined them
covering her name.

182
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,746
We're also investigating in secret.

183
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,669
Sir.

184
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,003
Trust us.

185
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,381
We'll get her back safely.

186
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,686
Something's going on
in the Oryun Community?

187
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,854
Nothing useful for your article.

188
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,940
- I don't have anything to say.
- I do.

189
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,028
The community leader
had an accident five years ago.

190
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,239
He survived after surgery

191
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,408
and started to spread
the theory of rebirth.

192
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,121
 Among those who were fooled
by him, twelve people have died.

193
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,415
And so have the manager of the community.

194
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,876
Now, tell me what you know.

195
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,546
I don't know anything.

196
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm not here to write an article.

197
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,427
One of my teammates is in there.

198
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
Honey.

199
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,600
How did it go?

200
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,561
Where is Ganghyun?

201
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,814
She's investigating something
in secret.

202
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,983
Then, why can't we reach her?

203
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,485
Is she somewhere dangerous?

204
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,821
Easy, she's fine.

205
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,157
She's with her colleagues.

206
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,324
She's fine, okay?

207
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,161
Gosh.

208
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,969
I finally got an answer from Bori.

209
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,222
He'll tell me about my next-born life
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

210
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,786
You're Detective Lee Ganghyun

211
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,538
from Gangha Police Station, right?

212
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,336
I've met you once before.

213
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,424
I'm Kim Jeongyeon, an SBC reporter.

214
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,426
Come on.

215
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,095
I'll introduce you to someone.

216
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,523
How did you become a manager?

217
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,611
Too many people

218
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,613
were killed here.

219
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,702
Shin Woohyuk and Lee Seongwook

220
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,579
met in a pyramid selling company.

221
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,082
They founded this community,

222
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,376
claiming to have discovered
the secret of rebirth

223
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
after a serious car accident.

224
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,381
Using the skills
they had learned in the company,

225
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,091
they started a cult.

226
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,177
Hopeless young people

227
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,054
were easily lured to the community,

228
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,306
but they couldn't bring much money.

229
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,267
So, Shin Woohyuk

230
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,520
solicited them to volunteer
to accumulate virtue

231
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,272
at a nursing hospital.

232
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,190
First, to the patients,

233
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,776
he serves a tea made by himself.

234
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,987
It was drugged, right?

235
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,573
I confirmed it yesterday.

236
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,784
The tea makes them relaxed,

237
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,453
so patients get addicted to it.

238
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,499
He lets the members submit reports

239
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,710
about the status of patients.

240
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,295
And he picks the target.

241
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,881
Someone who is rich

242
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,967
and in the last days of their life.

243
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,219
He lures them

244
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,889
to offer their whole fortune
for a happy next life.

245
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,098
Now,

246
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,018
you can rest in peace.

247
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,603
Thank you.

248
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,494
Yeji said she got an answer.

249
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,705
That means she'll get a poison.

250
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,833
Seven people will get it.

251
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,877
Escape from this place.

252
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,213
It seems like Bori noticed
that you're here.

253
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,256
They asked me for the list of new members,

254
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,925
so I ruled out your file.

255
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,969
What?

256
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804
I didn't tell anyone. How did he...

257
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,390
Bori has a lot of connections
in many fields.

258
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,353
I'll make a chance at night.
Get ready to go.

259
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,437
No.

260
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,148
I should save people.

261
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,276
How?

262
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,916
"Unyeon General Hospital"

263
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,047
"Unyeon General Hospital"

264
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,596
We're here for a patient

265
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,431
who had urgent surgery long ago.

266
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,726
You need a warrant for that.

267
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,478
We're in an urgent situation.

268
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,022
You had a patient
with a pipe-penetrating injury.

269
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,107
Do you remember him?

270
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,151
His name was Shin Woohyuk.

271
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,113
He hurt his lungs and liver
but survived after surgery.

272
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,615
Then, he founded a cult,
saying that was a miracle.

273
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,536
People who believe him
are committing suicide.

274
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,870
We need your help.

275
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,046
Yes, I remember him.

276
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,965
But

277
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,134
that patient

278
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,885
was dead.

279
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,890
I don't have much time,
so I'll make it quick.

280
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,518
We can find out

281
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,272
how often propofol was injected here
and identify who administered it.

282
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
Okay.

283
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,527
Shin Woohyuk was here, right?

284
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,945
"Jiho Plastic Surgeon"

285
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,030
Yes.

286
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,032
Why was he here?

287
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,368
Shin Woohyuk
was sent here with the patient

288
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,203
due to a traffic accident.

289
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,084
"TA patients list: Total of four"

290
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,631
He wanted
to change his whole face.

291
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
Even his ears.

292
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,218
When is he coming?

293
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,302
Tomorrow night.

294
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,683
When he gets here,

295
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,395
"Gangha Station
An Byungsik"

296
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,979
call me right away.

297
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,238
Yes, Mr. An.

298
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,324
Shin Woohyuk is planning to run away
after plastic surgery.

299
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,368
I also confirmed

300
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,204
that fund of GY was transferred
to his overseas account.

301
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,915
Lee Seongwook found it out.
That's why he was killed.

302
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,418
Ms. Lee and Isoo are in danger.

303
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,713
I'll get a call
when he comes for the surgery.

304
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,298
But we can't arrest him with that.

305
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,676
We need the proof of Lee's murder.

306
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,636
That's all we can use.

307
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,223
We'll wrap up
with meditation tonight.

308
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,351
Let's warm down before that.

309
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,895
Stand in pairs, everyone.

310
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,315
Give your partner
a shoulder massage.

311
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,110
Your shoulders are tense.

312
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,155
Gosh, it's hard.

313
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,116
Switch turns.

314
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,122
Oh, you're good at it.

315
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,874
Lower left, okay.

316
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,917
Yes, right there.

317
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,377
- It's great.
-  Next,

318
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,629
- hands on your partner's shoulders
- It's good.

319
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,214
and stretch.

320
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,720
What about the fingerprints?

321
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,054
I sent them.

322
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,639
How?

323
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,558
I have my own way.

324
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
Send another message.

325
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,771
I'll sneak into Bori's residence
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

326
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,148
Okay.

327
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,859
Bori will give poison

328
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,110
to seven members.

329
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,070
We should raid the scene.

330
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,906
Okay.

331
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,116
Hey, I'm getting exhausted.

332
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,784
Get off me.

333
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,971
This man was dead.

334
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,142
Shin Woohyuk was in the car
ahead of this truck.

335
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,354
What...

336
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,232
are you talking about?

337
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,276
Lee Seongwook
was in the same car.

338
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,112
They met
in a pyramid selling company.

339
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,697
After they had this accident,

340
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,449
they founded the Oryun Community.

341
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,375
Shin was convicted
three times,

342
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,626
and your husband Lee

343
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,711
was convicted twice for fraud.

344
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,964
Shin Woohyuk

345
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,424
is planning to run away
after hiding the money.

346
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,094
Shin killed your husband
because he found it out.

350
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,607
he can't be reborn...

351
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,487
- after the autopsy.
- You still don't get it?

352
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,864
All of those are fake. It's a fraud.

sneaked into the community.

00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,915
There was an emergency.

370
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,667
I came here because I trust you.

371
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,793
I see.

372
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,461
You're all dead now.

373
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,505
Who wants to turn yourself in?

374
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,388
Everyone's here now.

375
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,514
Hey, Bori.

376
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,057
You want to confess?

377
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,768
Yongcheol.

378
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
Show him what manners are.

379
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,188
Okay. Show me.

380
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
You can start the autopsy now.

381
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,920
Let's get started.

382
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,271
Damn.

383
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,118
You punk.

384
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,678
Finish it now.

385
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,830
Wake up!

386
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,712
Okay.

387
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,841
Ready to talk?

388
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,394
Are you okay?

389
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,854
I slept tight.

390
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,735
Lee Ganghyun
from Gangha Station...

391
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,361
"Background Check"

392
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,155
and a rich son.

393
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,158
Why are you here?

394
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,784
We're here to arrest you.

395
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,413
Did I do anything wrong?

396
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,624
Aid for suicide,

397
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,791
abetment for suicide

398
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,752
and abetment for murder.

399
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,547
And a murder for you.

400
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,508
That bastard.

401
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,595
Did you not learn anything
from your father's case?

402
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,265
You really want your father
to hold the funeral of his own daughter?

403
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,683
You do?

404
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,690
How many people have you killed so far?

405
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,027
I don't know. I stopped counting
after reaching 100.

406
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,072
They were going to die anyway.

407
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,157
I just helped them die happily.

408
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,620
Huh, shit.

409
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,205
You're such a crazy bastard.

410
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,752
If I were a silver spoon like you,
I'd have never done this.

411
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,630
Silver spoons
don't need to do anything, right?

412
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,048
It's so unfair.

413
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,385
Even if you were born rich,
you'd have been a trash anyway.

414
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,928
I can tell it from your face.

415
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,145
You are going to die here.

416
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,733
It'll take some time for you
to be found dead.

417
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,943
And me?

418
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,030
I'll disappear without a trace.

419
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,617
No, you can't do that.

420
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,286
Jeez.

421
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,414
In the sky over there

422
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,042
is a drone developed by Hansu Electronics,

423
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,421
which is invisible and inaudible.

424
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,505
It's a new model.

425
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,757
Our colleagues are on the way here.

426
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,842
You got it, idiot?

427
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,141
"Go!"

428
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,354
What a nice bullshit.

429
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,523
You could've made an excellent fraud.

430
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,651
Unfortunately, the police

431
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,112
are all under my control.

432
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,992
Your colleagues

433
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,079
are not coming.

434
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,556
You want a next-born life?

435
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,018
There's no such thing.

436
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,895
-  Hey.
-  You!

437
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,271
Bori, you fucking bastard!

438
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,397
You, punk!

439
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
Goddamn.

440
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,233
Jeez, damn it.

441
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,614
Untie me, quickly.

442
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,450
Damn.

443
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,333
This is how they killed Moon.

444
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,085
Shit.

445
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,252
Damn it.

446
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,261
Gosh, block the water.

447
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,140
Goddamn it.

448
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,687
Block it.

449
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,484
Jin.

450
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,568
What?

451
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,487
I'm sorry.

452
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,364
Stop sounding like a weak character.

453
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,241
Junyoung is on the way here.

454
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,743
I can't swim.

455
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,751
Hey.

456
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,211
You don't need to swim now.

457
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,963
Look. It's not about swimming.

458
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,548
Just look at me.

459
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,175
Breathe slowly.

460
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,301
Like me, okay?

461
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,929
In my house, you saw the photo

462
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,597
of me doing a free diving.

463
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,310
You can dive down up to 328 ft
without any equipment

464
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,854
and hold out for ten minutes.

465
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,314
You have enough oxygen
in your body to hold out.

466
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,607
Okay.

467
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,651
Believe in yourself.

468
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,945
Okay.

469
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,920
Open the door.

470
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,562
- Get a stab-proof vest and a gun.
-  Okay.

471
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,022
- Let's go, Mr. An.
- Go ahead.

472
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,816
-  What about you?
- I'll bring a support team.

473
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,860
We'd better make it a big thing.

474
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,028
Okay.

475
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,743
We'll raid the Oryun Community now.

476
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,662
Mr. Lee.

477
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,999
"SOU"

478
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,251
 We'll go get
the leader of Oryun.

479
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,503
We have no evidence yet.

480
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,506
But unless we move out now,

481
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,342
our colleagues could die.

482
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,344
You can leave if you want.

483
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,600
- Let's go!
-  Yes, sir.

484
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,395
Let's go bring Jeongyeon.

485
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,617
Slowly, slowly.

486
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,494
Breathe slowly.

487
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,246
Keep breathing slowly, okay?

488
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,208
Where are you going?

489
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,743
I'm tired.

490
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,745
Let's go get some massage.

491
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,121
Okay.

492
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,780
Get off!

493
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,407
Where's Lee Ganghyun?

494
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,826
Where is she now?

495
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,930
Hey, you okay?

496
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,181
Excuse me.

497
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,685
I know you're groggy now,
but let me ask one thing.

498
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,854
A detective sneaked in here a while ago.

499
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,272
Yes, I know.

500
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,607
You know where she is?

501
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,530
Please help her.

502
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,824
Let's move to a safe place.

503
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,786
No one on the second floor.

504
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,343
Where is Ms. Lee?

505
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,971
"Police officer background check
Lee Ganghyun"

506
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,772
Quiet.

507
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,739
Hands up!

508
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,949
Damn it.

509
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,050
It's under the floor.

510
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,847
Water.

511
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,931
It's a water tank.

512
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,516
A water tank is under the floor.

513
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,023
Here's a passage.

514
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,986
Ganghyun! Jin!

515
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,404
We're here. Hold out!

516
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,156
Hurry up! Water is rising.

517
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,001
Gosh, it stinks.

518
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,795
It's a smell of rotten corpses.

519
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,221
What?

520
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,389
Wait.

521
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,017
Back off.

522
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,090
Ganghyun.

523
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,925
Wake up, Ganghyun.

524
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,802
Hey, wake up!

525
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,971
Come on.

526
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,556
Lee Ganghyun!

527
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,350
Do cops carry out an arrest
without any evidence?

528
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,689
How can I open the water tank?

529
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,732
What are you talking--

530
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,858
Tell me!

531
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,195
- Shit.
- It's in the drawer.

532
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,655
Drawer...

533
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,739
Jeez.

534
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,082
Please, wake up.

535
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,127
Hey, Ganghyun.

536
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,129
Wake up! Hey!

537
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,512
Wake up.

538
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,097
Ganghyun, please.

539
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,515
Wake up!

540
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,698
Hey, Ganghyun.

541
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,074
Ganghyun!

542
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,535
Jeez, Ganghyun!

543
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,287
Ganghyun!

544
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,922
Gosh.

545
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,446
Okay, that's enough.

546
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,661
You okay?

547
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,380
You got them?

548
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:51,939
What's that?

549
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,067
It's me who saved her after struggling.

550
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,527
Why are those two hugging?

551
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,912
I'll hug you.

552
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,747
I was worried about you, bro.

553
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,082
Stop it.

554
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,375
Okay.

555
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,459
Go away.

556
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,555
Ganghyun.

557
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:37,985
You do it.

558
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,158
You're arrested

559
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,870
for suicide abetment,

560
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,955
murder abetment,

561
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,417
and attempted murder.

562
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,130
You may remain silent,

563
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,632
you may testify on your behalf,

564
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,925
and you may challenge

565
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,304
the properness of arrest.

566
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,478
Lower your eyes, punk.

567
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,004
Yeji.

568
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,343
Bori is a criminal
with three previous convictions for fraud.

569
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,429
Everything was a fake.

570
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,895
Call me later.

571
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,688
"Gangha Station
Lee Ganghyun"

572
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,441
I'll help you
solve your issues legally.

573
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,324
Gosh, it's cold.

574
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,081
Have a drink with me later.

575
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,500
What the hell?

576
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,044
Where are we drinking?

577
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,637
Ganghyun.

578
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,180
Mom.

579
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,059
You little brat.

580
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,894
Gosh.

581
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,023
- What's wrong with you?
-  Move, everyone.

582
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,110
-  Move.
-  I was so worried about you.

583
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,319
You okay?

584
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,781
- Yes.
-  Okay, then.

585
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,199
Good job.

586
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,177
Jeongyeon.

587
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,513
You'll be scolded for it later.

588
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,891
Let it slide, please.

589
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,392
Slide?

590
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,603
Never do it again.

591
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,855
I'm sorry.

592
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,652
I suddenly feel lonely.

593
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,363
Hug again?

594
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,325
- Get lost.
- Okay.

595
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,579
Mr. Choi.

596
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,002
I've got more wrinkles
thanks to you.

597
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,005
Here's the one who worries about me.

598
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,383
- Let's go.
-  Oh, you go ahead.

599
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:49,843
I'll go by my bike.

600
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,511
I also have a wrap-up party.

601
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,140
Gosh, it's cold.

602
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,684
Jeez.

603
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,816
Picture, please.

604
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,901
Okay.

605
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,517
"Gangha Police Station"

606
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,822
Mr. Park Changun.

607
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
Take this

608
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,497
and check it out.

609
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,791
What's this?

610
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,420
Lee Seongwook
risked his life to reveal...

611
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,046
the truth inside it.

612
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,426
At first, I was going to go
to Violent Crime Investigation Team 1,

613
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,220
but I changed my mind and came to you.

614
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,141
I made a copy of it

615
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,809
just in case.

616
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,103
Bye.

617
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,091
Well...

618
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,178
Shin Woohyuk and I...

619
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,808
founded the Oryun Community

620
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,645
and lured hundreds of people

621
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,690
to offer their whole fortune

622
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,234
to the community

623
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,570
and commit suicide.

624
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,786
All the evidence I've collected

625
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,704
is in this USB.

626
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,083
Please catch

627
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:28,835
Shin Woohyuk with this.

628
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,473
You mean, you want me
to stop the investigation?

629
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,892
I have an idea.

630
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,644
Just send us some people.

631
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,247
Hopeless people

632
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,457
need a religion.

633
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,225
What?

634
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,977
What are you talking about?

635
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,728
SOU moved out?

636
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,230
By whose order?

637
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,941
News?

638
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,279
Breaking news.

639
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,864
The leader of the Oryun Community,

640
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,824
Shin Woohyuk, was arrested for abetment

641
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,242
of murder and suicide.

642
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,327
Reporter Lee Giseok is at the site.

643
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,665
 Here is Na Han Won,
which is the headquarters of the Oryun Community.

644
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,835
Just now, the leader of the community Shin

645
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,421
and the accomplice Kim
were urgently arrested here.

646
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,006
Police investigating the death

647
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,175
of the manager Lee

648
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,301
- found out
- What's up?

649
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,261
- that Shin ordered Kim
- What the hell?

650
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,096
to murder the manager Lee.

651
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,598
Mr. Hwang Sunggu,

652
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,475
you're arrested for accepting bribes,
divulging official secrets

653
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,603
and obstructing official duties.

654
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,605
You punk,

655
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,065
- are you insane?
- Don't be any more indecent.

656
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,693
We got the evidence here.

657
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,198
Arrest him.

658
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,588
Thank you.

659
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,258
I even got my hair redone,

660
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,928
but I'm dating him? Jeez.

661
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,889
Ganghyun said this place

662
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,308
is the best in this town,

663
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,392
Mr. Jin.

664
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,728
It's me who brought her here first,

665
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,521
Mr. Park.

666
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,941
No wonder.

667
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,031
Hm, it's even better than usual today.

668
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,577
This is good, Mr. Jin.

669
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,956
What's wrong with you?

670
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,417
Hm, it's yummy.

671
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,885
We'll talk casually
if you drink this, okay?

672
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,055
All of a sudden?

673
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,682
After all those days?

674
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,226
No, I won't, Mr. Park.

675
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,853
Okay, you keep it, then. I'll go casual.

676
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,815
How ridiculous.

677
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,651
Look at this thick froth.

678
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,449
Okay, done?

679
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,578
I found you annoying like hell at first.

680
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,956
I still find you annoying.

681
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,960
Thank you.

682
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,256
Thanks to your...

683
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,842
kind of reckless
and ridiculous strategies,

684
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,679
we finally caught Shin Woohyuk.

685
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,644
You'll never know
how meaningful it is to Ganghyun.

686
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,772
What a complicated compliment.

687
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,570
By the way,

688
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,573
is there something between you two?

689
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,783
What do you mean?

690
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,785
I mean, you two

691
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,037
had some good feelings,

692
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,122
dated each other, or something?

693
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,624
What?

694
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,918
I already have someone in my mind.

695
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,128
You do?

696
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,630
Hey, don't tell me
you're interested in Ganghyun--

697
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,757
No way.

698
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,508
I was just wondering.

699
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,014
I saw you hugging each other
at the scene earlier.

700
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,766
We're bestie to each other.

701
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,518
I'll be her bestie some day.

702
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,814
You think you can do that?

703
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,984
We've been close for ten years
since the Police University.

704
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,362
Just keep drinking.

705
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,202
 Today, in Na Han Won,

706
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,079
the headquarters of the Oryun Community,

707
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,622
the leader Shin was arrested.

708
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,749
According to the police investigation,

709
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,209
the Oryun Community

710
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,419
could be involved in the death

711
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,129
of Lee and Moon...

712
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,715
You watched it.

713
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,467
Yes.

714
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,261
Isoo was in danger today.

715
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,806
Why don't you call him and ask how he is?

716
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,517
Yes, good idea.

717
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,000
Cheers.

718
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,095
Pour me a drink, too.

719
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,473
Wow.

720
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,016
Ms. Go Misook.

721
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,476
You want a drink?

722
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,728
Because I was so upset
about my daughter.

723
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,564
I'll get drunk.

724
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,400
Pour it.

725
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,902
I'll go crazy tonight.

726
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,155
Cheers.

727
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,495
It's sweet.

728
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,622
Why do people drink soju?

729
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,750
It's bitter.

730
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
It's me.

731
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,408
Yes.

732
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,077
I just...

733
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,913
Are you... okay?

734
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,336
Yes.

735
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,964
Take... care...

736
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,844
Go get a treatment tomorrow.

737
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,279
A senior superintendent

738
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,698
accepted bribes from a cult leader

739
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,492
and divulged the official secrets.

740
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,369
Even worse,

741
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,080
he framed a detective
investigating the cult leader

742
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,165
for accepting bribes.

743
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,420
Should I take all the responsibility
by resigning?

744
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,467
Well...

745
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,303
Sir.

746
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,014
We did have a corrupted police officer.

747
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,768
But the culprit
who killed so many people was caught

748
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,020
by us, the police officers.

749
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,107
We'll complete the investigation

750
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,110
and reveal everything clearly
as soon as possible.

751
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,576
Please appoint Lee Hyungjun,
who was dismissed unfairly,

752
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,536
as the senior superintendent.

753
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,246
That's the right way

754
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,748
to show the innovation

755
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,459
of the police organization.

756
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,730
It's time to go.

757
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,106
Oh.

758
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,746
Why are you crying now?
You were so happy last night.

759
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,540
I'm not crying.

760
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,337
Honey, thank you
for holding out all of these.

761
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,465
Congratulations.

762
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,139
How do I look? Cool?

763
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,682
You look great.

764
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,066
Hey, Mr. Park.

765
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,780
Sir.

766
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,158
Please forgive me.

767
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,162
No. I'm sorry, too.

768
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,542
Let me escort you.

769
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,129
See you at the station.

770
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,214
Okay.

771
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,511
Thank you.

772
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,810
You're crying again?

773
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,814
Certificate of appointment.

774
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,150
As of October 24, 2023,
Superintendent Lee Hyungjun

775
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,821
is appointed to the senior superintendent
of Seoul Gangha Police Station.

776
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,577
Congratulations.

777
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
Thank you.

778
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,221
Thank you.

779
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,309
"Dead body in Jin Myeongchul's house?"

780
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,044
A dead body was found in my house?

781
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,254
 Who died?

782
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,505
 He drove here--

783
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,589
After being stabbed.

784
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,674
We got a suspect.

785
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,968
 He said he knew something huge.

786
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,095
 The culprits are at least two.

787
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,347
 Follow him
to get the accomplice.

788
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,682
Freeze!

789
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:13,808
Is it related to you?

790
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,351
 You're suspecting me?

791
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,770
 You're the one
that he talked to last.

792
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,273
-  Trust me.
- An article about Isoo is up.

793
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,608
We'll rule out Jin Isoo from this case.

794
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,277
Did your mom commit suicide?

795
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,404
I'll take responsibility

796
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,947
if it's related to my family.

797
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,491
Hiding everything from me,
you didn't really know

798
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,742
I'd be like this?

799
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,120
Stay tuned for bonus clip

800
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,665
Bro.

801
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,793
I watched the chairman's debate.

802
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,045
You did?

803
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,297
He did so well.

804
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,133
It's easier said than done.

805
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,926
Oh, is one of them for me?

806
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,847
Oh.

807
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,348
I got it for myself,

808
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,642
but you can take it.

809
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,269
I'll vote for the chairman.

810
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,354
It's okay. Even I won't do that.

811
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,606
Oh.

812
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,065
- Coffee for me?
-  Hey.

813
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,817
No, this is for Ganghyun.

814
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,068
What about me?

815
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,153
Go buy it yourself.

816
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,905
You speak casually to each other?

817
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,281
Yes. It's been a few days.

818
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,365
You look so close.

819
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,159
We're not.

820
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,288
Yes, you are.
