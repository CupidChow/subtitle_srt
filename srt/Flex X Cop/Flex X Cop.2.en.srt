00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,944
"Jin Isoo

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,905
"Lee Ganghyun
by Park Jihyun"

3

"Park Junyoung by Kang Sangjun
Choi Kyungjin by Kim Shinbi"

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,209
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,253
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,842
"3 hours before the appointment ceremony"

7
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,343
Mr. Choi...

8
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,721
I need more sleep. Please...

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,727
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,270
Where's Isoo?

11
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,147
He's in bed.

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,483
-He's still in bed?
-Yes.

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,880
Wake up.

14
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,678
Gosh...

15
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,806
What's up at this early?

16
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,682
I'm tired.

17
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,309
And my nose hurts.

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,186
Get up, you crazy brat.

19
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,271
Didn't I tell you to go to work today?

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,440
No, I won't.

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,150
I told you I wouldn't.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,610
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,278
This is a different scale

24
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,822
from what you've done so far.

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,699
The honor of Father and our company
depends on you.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,992
Why, in the first place,

27
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,453
have you involved me
in such a big matter?

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,538
That's...

29
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,832
Don't say like that.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
I trust you.

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,418
You're making a mistake.

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,967
You'll regret
if you mess this up.

33
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,141
You want to disown your father like this?

34
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
Seungju.

35
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,982
Since I became Father's...

36
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,733
no...

37
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,736
the chairman's son,
my life has been a mess.

38
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,614
It's time to stop this mess.

39
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
He's gone?

40
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,840
For press conference.

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,509
He has one every day.

42
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,927
Does he enjoy it?

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,513
He'll announce

44
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,640
that everything was made up by himself.

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,101
He'll make up for it

46
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,811
by resigning from his position.

47
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,606
The chairman would cancel his candidacy.

48
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,984
Vice chairman will be kicked out
to the overseas branch.

49
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,447
What a good chance for his cousins
who had eyes on his position.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,393
Hello.

51
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,230
I'm the vice chairman of Hansu

52
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,940
Jin Seungju.

53
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm here today

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,611
to notify

55
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,030
the truth...

56
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,493
about my brother's case.

57
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,669
- The truth is...
- The truth!

58
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,798
I'll tell you myself.

59
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,133
Jin Isoo!

60
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
This is for you.

61
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,755
You knew he would come?

62
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,049
You didn't?

63
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,177
Isoo is a good boy.

64
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,681
How did you become a cop?

65
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,349
I was so into detective stories...

66
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,728
Detective stories?

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,023
How did you get the culprit?

68
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,319
I heard the accomplice didn't appear

69
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,279
at the appointed place.

70
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,615
Oh...

71
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,618
Well, during the stakeout

72
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,621
I just got an intuitive sense

73
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,248
like a kind of hunch.

74
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,668
"Incapable police needed my help"

75
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,879
Incapable police?

76
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
Do we have an event today?

77
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,385
Musicians!

78
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,887
Play it well today. Okay?

79
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,555
- Yes.
- Okay?

80
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,142
Pull it from the back. Pull!

81
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,435
More, more.

82
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,733
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,693
Okay.

84
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,446
Chief wants us to come down.

85
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,184
Thank you.

86
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,522
Huh?

87
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,319
Wow, you didn't have to prepare
this much.

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,321
Thank you so much.

89
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,573
Oh.

90
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,119
Let's work hard.

91
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,500
Ms. Lee?

92
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,522
Damn it.

93
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,533
It's nice.

94
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,076
Neat and clean.

95
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,416
Where's my desk?

96
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,252
You don't need to come.

97
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,212
Why don't you go home?

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,756
Why are you being polite?

99
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,758
Just go home.

100
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,093
You don't need to do this.

101
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,595
Yes, I do.

102
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,805
When I commit, I give my all.

103
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,015
Commit what?

104
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,266
Playing cops?

105
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,518
Here's not your playground.

106
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,814
Why do you treat me like this?

107
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,566
You shouldn't do that.

108
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,444
Oh, these incapable police officers

109
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,280
are supposed
to give you a standing ovation?

110
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,584
Jeez... I've never said that in this way.

111
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,421
This is what reporters do, right?

112
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,631
But this is true.

113
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,596
So?

114
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
So what?

115
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,849
You'll come everyday

116
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,518
with a sense of duty?

117
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,353
Yes.

118
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,189
-Very sincerely.
-Then, I'll give you a piece of advice.

119
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,816
Stay put doing nothing.

120
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,069
Anything you hear or see in this place

121
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,530
is never allowed
to be uploaded to your SNS.

122
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,241
If you bother my work,

123
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,992
you're dead.

124
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,789
That's not one piece.

125
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,668
Let's go to the meeting.

126
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,259
I welcome you. Let's take a photo later.

127
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,343
That's your desk.

128
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,928
Let's go!

129
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,012
Okay.

130
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,895
Is that a hazing or something?
They're so childish.

131
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,980
Aren't they?

132
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,864
Oh, I'm fine.

133
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,449
It's so embarrassing.

134
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,202
Even a chair is a mess here!

135
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,954
I'll get you a new one.

136
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,289
Mr. Choi.

137
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,832
Get me new clothes

138
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,208
and do me a favor.

139
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,842
Please transfer Jin Isoo
to desk duty.

140
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,931
Desk duty?

141
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,310
He caught the culprit you failed to catch.

142
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,313
He's in your team now.

143
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,065
A police investigation
isn't a child's play.

144
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,483
He's an untrained citizen

145
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,485
and an immature rich son.

146
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,362
I'm sure he'll make trouble.

147
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,530
You should handle that

148
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
all by yourself.

149
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,285
It's you guys who caused all of these.

150
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,995
Please get the fact right.

151
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,748
It was decided by the upper line.

152
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,002
Then...

153
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,962
you just tell them the truth

154
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,089
and make up for it by resigning.

155
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,842
You want that?

156
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,594
That sounds good.

157
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,596
Forget it.

158
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
I'll handle him.

159
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,850
Watch him closely.

160
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,353
- Okay.
- Watch your mouth.

161
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,771
Yes, sir.

162
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,564
Start the reporting.

163
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
Yes.

164
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,701
Oh, you're up.

165
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,786
Yes, mom.

166
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,165
- Good morning.
- Yes.

167
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,216
I'm worried about Isoo.

168
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,219
He's not pulling himself together,

169
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,845
and now he became a cop.

170
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,933
I know Seungju had no other way, but...

171
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,645
I'm afraid he'd make any trouble.

172
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,480
I couldn't even sleep last night.

173
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,065
Isoo is not that immature.

174
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,650
Trust him.

175
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,194
My Seungju is so reliable,

176
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,363
but what's wrong with Isoo?

177
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,907
Mom.

178
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,204
Your mom isn't wrong.

179
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,499
Prepare to send him overseas
after the election.

180
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
He'll be a burden if I win the election.

181
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,552
Mom.

182
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,345
Please stop nagging on Isoo.

183
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,348
I've never nagged on him.

184
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,104
- That's all.
- Okay.

185
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,567
So, team 2 will focus
on the serial robbery cases

186
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,111
and team 1 will take
further cases coming up.

187
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,655
"Protect warmly,"

188
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,657
"execute fairly."

189
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,833
Don't worry.

190
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,544
He knows his father's election
depends on him.

191
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,879
He'll behave himself.

192
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,547
You think so?

193
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,807
Wow, it's awesome!

194
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,285
What's all this?

195
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,455
Ossobuco
and Parmigiana di melanzane.

196
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,248
Sounds so delicious!

197
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,833
- I'll have those.
- Okay.

198
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,293
Michael Ballack!

199
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,795
His team is winning 2 to 1.

200
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,546
He's easy in dribbling. Great.

201
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,924
Here comes Drogba from the right.
He's coming.

202
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,383
Drogba! Didier Drogba!

203
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
Lampard on the right under, shoot!

204
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
Computer!

205
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
Com...

206
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,978
Don't you know
you shouldn't turn it off like that?

207
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,065
Don't you know
you shouldn't play games here?

208
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,360
Here's not your playground.

209
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,445
You still don't get it?

210
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,119
I understand this situation exactly.

211
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,956
This is a kind of business

212
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,833
between the police and Hansu Group.

213
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,960
We are in a contractual relationship.

214
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,254
You don't have any power to break it,

215
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,005
but you're not cooperating

216
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,217
due to your self-esteem,
inferiority, or something.

217
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,135
I don't bear any of those.

218
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,262
You don't?

219
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,596
But everyone bears that.

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,266
If you decided
to carry out the contract,

221
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,184
you shouldn't behave like this.

222
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,687
Had you done it properly
in the first place

223
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,022
I wouldn't have had to do this.

224
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,997
Get out in three minutes

225
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
or I will arrest you
for obstruction of official duties.

226
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,335
Hey!

227
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,546
What kind of official duties

228
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,089
did they obstruct?

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,634
It's delicious.

230
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
Thank you.

231
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,598
You have two minutes and 40 seconds left.

232
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,932
That punk...

233
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,524
We couldn't find a good place,

234
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,485
so we prepared it here
to enjoy with all of you.

235
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
By the way, who are you, sir?

236
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,616
I'm a secretary of detective Jin Isoo.

237
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,077
No detective

238
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,038
needs a secretary.

239
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,248
You're not allowed to be here.

240
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,710
You have two minutes.

241
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
Let's wrap it up.

242
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,189
Goddamn it.

243
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,441
You're done?

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,446
You saw his desk?

245
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,114
Calm down.

246
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,034
He's just trying to get on our nerves.

247
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,244
Gosh, what do we do?

248
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,038
No idea.

249
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,790
We can't kick him out

250
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,250
or send him away to other team.

251
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,421
Let's make him quit by himself.

252
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,757
How?

253
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,098
Hey, is that yummy?

254
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
Ye... No, it's not!

255
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,394
Come here.

256
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,482
That Jin Isoo...

257
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,818
What's his weak point?

258
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,653
-Weak point?
-Yes.

259
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,154
You must know.

260
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,865
You follow him
and even call him bro.

261
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,618
No weak point but only strong points.

262
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,995
Damn...

263
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,122
Isn't there anything he hates?

264
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,289
Anything he hates...

265
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,166
Oh, he hates something boring.

266
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,920
Something boring?

267
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,843
"Investigation report"

268
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,892
What's that?

269
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,310
Work for you.

270
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,895
Files on Lee Changhyun's case.

271
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,731
Summarize them by today.

272
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,232
You know,

273
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,443
90% of police jobs are writing reports.

274
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
Work hard

275
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,113
and get it right.

276
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,700
That's already done.

277
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,201
Keep quiet.

278
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,791
For your reference.

279
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
It'd be hard for him.

280
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,853
Absolutely.

281
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,188
It's hard even for you.

282
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,564
Hey, I'm...

283
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,648
Huh?

284
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,150
But isn't this

285
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,443
workplace harassment?

286
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,446
Okay.

287
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
Go report us.

288
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,949
Call the police.

289
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,243
Forget it.

290
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,625
He's gone.

291
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,211
Files are also gone.

292
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,173
Hello?

293
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
Yes, sir.

294
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,053
What's up?

295
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,055
I don't know. He wants me to come.

296
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,476
"Ji..."

297
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,273
Oh, Ms. Lee.

298
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,738
I didn't expect
I would write a report

299
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,532
at this age.

300
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,951
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,372
Jin asked me how to write a report.

302
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,500
It's you
who should guide and teach him

303
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,669
every single work, right?

304
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,878
Yes, that's right.

305
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,755
I'll handle it.

306
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,802
-Mr. Jin?
-Yes?

307
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,095
Come with me.

308
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,179
Okay.

309
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,933
Your typing improved.

310
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,729
They're getting me more wrinkles.

311
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,358
Jeez...

312
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,491
Wow, this is...

313
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,910
It really soothes my wrist.

314
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Lady first.

315
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,047
Remove it.

316
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,845
Don't ask anything.

317
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,898
Is something up?

318
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,484
A 70-year-old with dementia
is missing in Gangha 3-dong.

319
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,695
Jeez... Gangha 3-dong is huge.

320
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
How do they...

321
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,453
Let's help them.

322
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,787
What?

323
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,831
Missing Investigation Team

324
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,916
needs more hands.

325
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
Let's go.

326
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,545
Wait...

327
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,923
Hey, Jin, let's go.

328
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,344
Okay, let's get to work.

329
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,182
Jeez, it's so annoying.

330
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,980
76-year-old male, Park Chunsik.

331
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,316
At the time of missing, he was wearing

332
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,276
daily hanbok with a gray vest.

333
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,527
Let's search for him.

334
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,987
Yes, sir.

335
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,827
We'll search
from here to Gangha station.

336
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,288
Thanks.
I'll pay you back.

337
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,167
From here to Gangha station.

338
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
We're walking? From here to there?

339
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,171
We should find him before sunset.

340
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,423
He could collapse
due to diabetes.

341
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
Let's go!

342
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,552
We don't have much time.

343
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,846
Right. Move quickly!

344
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,974
Okay, I got it.

345
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,313
Jin Isoo.

346
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,899
I got it. Gosh...

347
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,484
How grumpy...

348
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,970
Hello, sir.

349
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,263
Have you seen this man?

350
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,159
What's all this?

351
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
What?

352
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,519
Excuse me, sir.

353
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,480
Have you seen this man?

354
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,398
Hey!

355
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,901
They found him.

356
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,548
He's awesome.

357
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,927
Take care, sir.

358
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,100
Okay.

359
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,852
He won this watch!

360
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,654
What the hell is going on?

361
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,991
He's a man of capacity.

362
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,786
Searching for an old man
with dementia.

363
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,539
The one who finds him first
will win this watch.

364
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,957
Tell him to delete it now.

365
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,125
Okay.

366
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,209
It's cool.

367
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,899
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

368
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,192
You were awesome, bro.

369
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,444
Oh, stop.

370
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,862
Hey, take a look.

371
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,114
-Which one looks better?
-The upper one.

372
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,449
I'll pick this one, then.

373
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,456
Good morning.

374
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,084
He's annoying me in every way.

375
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,970
Violent Crime Investigation Team 1.

376
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,263
Okay.

377
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,849
A body was found at Gangha quay.

378
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,184
Let's go.

379
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,355
Detective Jin Isoo.

380
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,648
We should go.

381
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,651
Okay.

382
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,116
Hey, you come in your luxurious car.

383
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,996
Let's ride this.

384
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,831
- I'll drive.
- No.

385
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,916
I'll drive.

386
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,045
Get on.

387
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,339
Jeez, my new outfit...

388
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,974
To the Gangha quay
in 30 minutes.

389
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,059
Be there on time.

390
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,397
You're challenging me?

391
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,274
Okay.

392
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,213
That punk.

393
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,263
That road is under construction.

394
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,516
That prince isn't good at directions.

395
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,434
"Gangha Quay"

396
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,363
You can't get in now.

397
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,948
- Police.
- Ah...

398
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,157
Hold on.

399
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,748
- What's up?
- Police are here.

400
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,834
We're from Gangha station.

401
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,043
You found a dead body?

402
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
Yes, I reported it.

403
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,339
Leave your car here
and let's go to the scene.

404
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,925
Wasn't it found in the yacht?

405
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,135
Let us park inside.

406
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,013
That area is only for boat owners.

407
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,848
I can't let just anyone in.

408
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,141
Just anyone?

409
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,101
We're here for an investigation.

410
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,228
Sorry, but some clients

411
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,564
are very sensitive about outsiders.

412
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,149
I can't help it. Sorry.

413
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,580
That's my bro.

414
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
"Yoon Jiwon
forensic doctor in NFS"

415
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,181
Nice weather.

416
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,437
Is he the silver spoon?

417
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,730
Yes.

418
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,732
He looks sly.

419
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,858
He looks rude.

420
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,660
We're putting them on?

421
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,994
It's like a movie.

422
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,832
Only real cops get into the site.

423
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,294
You told me to come to the site.

424
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,587
Watch your tone.

425
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,464
I'm talking casually to Ganghyun.

426
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,299
Don't do that to me.

427
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,634
You wait in the car.

428
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,929
Go wait in your car.

429
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,056
Is it why you told me to come?

430
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,684
I brought you to keep you
from making any trouble.

431
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,851
No SNS allowed.

432
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,937
Hey...

433
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,323
By the way, why am I obeying her?

434
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,743
Is it an aftereffect?

435
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,205
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

436
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,581
Goddamn it.

437
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,335
Okay.

438
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,299
The dead body was left to be easily seen.

439
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,261
The manager here said he thought
she was sleeping.

440
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,806
The dead body was not hidden.

441
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,661
Here's a bag.

442
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,977
Found out something?

443
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,645
Yeah.

444
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,230
A ligature mark here

445
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,940
and a wound on the occipital.

446
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,067
Her dress is wet, but not by dewdrops.

447
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,403
So, she could've been drowned?

448
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,781
We'll see by an autopsy.

449
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,034
She's wearing a luxurious dress

450
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,952
but she seems malnourished.

451
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,955
By the way...

452
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,792
her face looks familiar, right?

453
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,224
You okay?

454
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,059
Yes.

455
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,023
I envy him.

456
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,337
Come check this powder.

457
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,755
Yes, sir.

458
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,966
This is her. Jung Ina.

459
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,051
She's a model.

460
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,095
Right.

461
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,693
Let's find out her agency.

462
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,777
Okay.

463
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,882
Detective Jin.
See me later?

464
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
Woah.

465
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,599
Can I take a picture?

466
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,392
Of course!

467
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,026
Let me join you on it someday.

468
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,194
I'll let you drive it

469
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,197
if you promise to be on my side.

470
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,325
I'm always on your side.

471
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,035
I'm the Star-Lord X.

472
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,746
I'm your follower.

473
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,456
My girlfriend, too.

474
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,083
Hmm...

475
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,752
So, she's Gamora?

476
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,545
-No, she's Groot.
-Groot?

477
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,630
Yes.

478
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,590
That's a new combination.

479
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,800
Come on.

480
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,181
Jin, let's go.

481
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,724
To where?

482
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,850
Just come.

483
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,228
Is she always like that?

484
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,481
She's so oppressive and overbearing.

485
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,899
No. She just hates you.

486
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,111
You're way too honest.

487
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,113
Hey!

488
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,782
Hey, there!

489
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,659
You're ignoring me?

490
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,118
Hey, Ms. Lee!

491
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,453
Get on.

492
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,246
Do you think I come and go

493
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,040
whenever I'm told to?

494
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,708
-You're doing that now.
-No way.

495
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,126
I'm going home.

496
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,586
You can come when you want

497
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,296
but need my permission to go.

498
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,382
When seniors order, juniors must obey.

499
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,717
You can quit
if you don't like it.

500
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,681
Why is this car like this?
Is it a bumper car or something?

501
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,726
Gosh, it's dirty.

502
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,982
Shut up and fasten your belt.

503
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,775
Jeez...

504
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,277
Where are we headed to?

505
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,114
In a movie, a cop's life
looks so interesting.

506
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,825
They chase criminals
with fascinating actions

507
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,618
and handcuff the criminal.

508
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,121
You know what they don't show?

509
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,749
A labor of detectives in reality.

510
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,543
When a case occurs,

511
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,378
we investigate the victim's family,

512
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,255
friends, and colleagues one by one.

513
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,424
To get security camera footage,

514
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,050
we call everywhere to ask

515
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
or visit every store.

516
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,678
Why whine next to me?

517
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,638
A sheltered-grown rich son

518
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,932
doesn't need to do all of these.

519
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
That's what I mean.

520
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,396
Jeez...

521
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,524
After threatening failed,
you're convincing me.

522
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,526
I'm saying it for your sake.

523
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,653
So, where on earth are we going?

524
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,114
The victim is a model.

525
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
Police.

526
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,245
Where's the CEO?

527
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,205
Wait, please.

528
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,959
They're tall.

529
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,169
Come this way.

530
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,426
Meet all the staff

531
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,969
and ask about Jung Ina.

532
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,056
Meet all of them?

533
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,599
Find out something useful.

534
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
Yes...

535
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,075
No, that's not enough.

536
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,285
Yes...

537
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
Hm?

538
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,582
Yeah.

539
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,375
I see...

540
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,546
What humble clothes!

541
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,882
How old?

542
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,467
Police.

543
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,136
Right, I know...

544
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,764
I know it's a good opportunity,

545
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,267
but it's us who decide our own value.

546
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,895
Tell them to revise the contract.

547
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,897
Yes, that's what I mean.

548
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,607
Why don't you hang up for now?

549
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,489
What's up?

550
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
Jung Ina

551
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,868
belongs here, right?

552
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,247
What about Ina?

553
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,040
She was found dead.

554
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,087
She was here last night.

555
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,632
She left
for an important appointment.

556
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,301
What time did she leave?

557
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,805
It was around 8:00 p.m.

558
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,183
You know whom she was meeting?

559
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,893
No.

560
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,938
Did you notice any change in her

561
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,566
or anything strange
she was going through recently?

562
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,985
No. Nothing special.

563
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,240
How's her family relationship?

564
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,533
Well...

565
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,451
She had a widowed mother

566
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,537
who passed away ten days ago.

567
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,164
Maybe she has no other family.

568
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,667
Okay. Thank you for cooperation.

569
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,004
Please call me
if you recall anything about her.

570
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,887
Jung Ina's dead.

571
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,265
Check out
all the contracts on her.

572
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,811
Let's follow each other.

573
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,230
I heard he's a Casanova.

574
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,316
Not a Casanova

575
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,775
but a romanticist.

576
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,028
What about Hong Euna of MK Group?

577
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,197
Oh, I know that.

578
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,698
The Gangnamdaero case?

579
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,700
That was not a romance but a thriller.

580
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,244
Wait for a second.

581
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,579
Stay here.

582
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,039
Go eat sushi in Japan?

583
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,419
Hey, Ganghyun!

584
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,879
I found out something.

585
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,339
Submit it as a report.

586
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,759
Jeez... Where's her manner?

587
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,224
Stop joking and open the door.

588
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,226
Hey!

589
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,644
I don't have my wallet.

590
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,149
How rude! Gosh...

591
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,924
Jung Ina's autopsy begins.

592
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,679
A ligature mark.

593
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,570
I'm home.

594
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,280
You're late.

595
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,614
Are you still up?

596
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,408
Do you eat on time?

597
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,373
It's kimchijjigae.

598
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
Want a drink?

599
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
Okay.

600
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,881
Hold on.

601
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,731
Cheers.

602
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,281
A case occurred?

603
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,369
Yes, she's a model, only 22 years old.

604
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,537
She was about to blossom.

605
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,582
I came out after the autopsy started.

606
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,877
You'll be busy from tomorrow.

607
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,882
How's the newbie?

608
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,469
Jeez... I've never seen

609
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,554
that kind of jerk.

610
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,682
He called a catering service
to the police station.

611
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,726
And he got a large computer

612
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,977
to play a game at work.

613
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,604
Even worse, the chief...

614
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,570
Anyway, he's a real freak.

615
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,989
I see.

616
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,493
Jeez, it must be tough for you.

617
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,413
Okay.

618
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,668
One more drink.

619
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,796
Jeez.

620
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,798
Another drinking party?

621
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,299
It's not a heavy drinking.

622
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,468
Just one drink while she's having dinner.

623
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,971
What a father and a daughter.

624
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,854
Ganghyun.

625
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,939
Yes?

626
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,315
You know,

627
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,193
-the son of that pharmacy--
-That again?

628
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,278
Enough.

629
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,405
Just listen to me.

630
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,824
He looked like actor Song Joongki.

631
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,162
Mom.

632
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,417
He has such blessed looks,
yet he has no girlfriend?

633
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,920
Then, something's wrong with him.

634
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,505
No, I won't see him.

635
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,593
I wish you

636
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,387
spend a night at your boyfriend's place

637
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,473
instead of a night-duty room.

638
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,226
Don't you think it's a waste

639
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,811
of your beautiful youth?

640
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,855
Not at all.

641
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,940
Dating is a waste of time.

642
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,775
I'd rather catch one more criminal.

643
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,155
Okay, both of you are such know-it-alls.

644
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,698
Why me, too?

645
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,326
Wash up and go to bed.

646
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,411
You know what time it is?

647
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,913
Okay, you go get some sleep.

648
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,790
- Go.
- Good night.

649
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,501
Cheers.

650
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,462
Wrap it up!

651
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
Okay, okay. Go.

652
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,381
Go to bed. We're done.

653
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,637
- Just one more bite.
- Go inside.

654
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,549
Why are you so depressed?

655
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,637
The whole team is ignoring me.

656
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,600
After ordering me around all day

657
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,977
just as she wanted,

658
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,105
she threw me on the street and left.

659
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,525
I don't understand.

660
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,947
You remember your high school days?

661
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,865
You know,

662
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,535
some guys were jealous of you
and held you in check.

663
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,620
That's what they're doing.

664
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,871
Those guys are scared

665
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,748
if you catch a culprit again.

666
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
Just smash them.

667
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,299
Sounds good.

668
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,948
What's up this time?

669
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,701
I'm feeling sensitive
after missing my morning coffee.

670
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,286
Why didn't you get up earlier?

671
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,996
What do you want?

672
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,749
The autopsy result is out.

673
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,000
Why do you care?

674
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,126
Do you have to ask?

675
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,800
Detective Lee, let's go. We're late.

676
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,976
Jin Isoo.

677
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,812
I'm warning you.

678
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,023
An autopsy room isn't for anyone.

679
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,108
It's too much for normal people.

680
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,194
Do I look like a normal person?

681
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,457
- Hello.
- Hello.

682
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,917
Where's Dr. Yoon?

683
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,752
She's in the room.

684
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,837
-Should I call her?
-No, I'll go see her.

685
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,308
You want to check?

686
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,478
Oh...

687
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,106
Okay. Let me see.

688
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,958
You brought the silver spoon?

689
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,043
Yeah, he's so annoying.

690
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,173
Jin Isoo.

691
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,891
Jin.

692
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,143
Stop playing a trick.

693
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,646
Jin Isoo, wake up.

694
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,315
Jin Isoo, Jin Isoo?

695
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,114
You okay?

696
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,199
I was joking.

697
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,410
You're fooled, right?

698
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,081
What the hell?

699
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,961
The estimated time of death is?

700
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,088
It's from 1:00 to 1:30 a.m.

701
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,882
And the cause of death is?

702
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,342
Well...

703
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,843
It's complicated.

704
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,970
You saw this last time.

705
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,264
She was strangled with hands

706
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,933
but no congestion or fracture.

707
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,814
A fracture could occur
by strangling?

708
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,497
If I strangle you with a hand

709
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,083
your hyoid bone here often breaks.

710
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,379
I see.

711
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,839
Okay.

712
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,509
She's not strangled to death.

713
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:26,927
Right.

714
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,221
She's not drowned, either.

715
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,306
River water was in her stomach,

716
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,724
but it was not that much.

717
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,562
That means she was in the water, though.

718
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,147
What was fatal is

719
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,899
an occipital fissure in the left.

720
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,652
She was hit so hard
that her skull was sunken.

721
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,946
A murder weapon

722
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,823
would be like this

723
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,868
or this.

724
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,370
From the angle,
the murderer is left-handed.

725
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,621
They will be strong.

726
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,914
But...

727
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,041
she might've been hit from the side

728
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,585
with a right hand like this.

729
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,089
Wow.

730
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,632
You're so keen.

731
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,426
I am.

732
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,594
But...

733
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,013
Hitting from the side...

734
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,515
Gosh...

735
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,851
and hitting from the back

736
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,270
make different shapes of wounds.

737
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,441
We also consider that.

738
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,776
I see.

739
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,612
So, you mean the victim

740
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,072
was strangled, hit on the head,

741
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,741
and drown into the river?

742
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,117
Right.

743
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,869
And...

744
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,705
she has bruises on her arms.

745
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,503
What could this be?

746
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,964
I don't know.

747
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,316
She was hit on the head, strangled,

748
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,734
and thrown into the river.

749
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,320
And she was picked up onto the yacht.

750
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,698
No, no. Or...

751
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,993
Throw her into the river and pick her up,
and then hit her head?

752
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,079
Why?

753
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,413
For what?

754
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,540
Sherlock Holmes on the case, huh?

755
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,001
What's your purpose?

756
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,045
What?

757
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,672
What's your plan this time?

758
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,465
Why?

759
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,008
Are you scared?

760
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,637
You're scared
if I catch the culprit again.

761
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,726
Hey, mister.

762
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,481
A motiveless assailant became a cop
and finally got insane.

763
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,026
You think you'll catch the culprit
by accident again?

764
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,320
What if I catch the bastard?

765
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,492
Never.

766
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,244
That'd never happen.

767
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,620
If I fail to catch him,

768
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,497
I'll get out of your sight.

769
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,000
I'll move to desk duty or stay home.

770
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,335
-Sounds great.
-But if I catch him,

771
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,421
you should admit

772
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,047
that I'm a real cop.

773
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,049
Deal.

774
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,426
Deal.

775
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,182
The forensic result is out.

776
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,438
This zipper bag found on the site
was empty.

777
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,856
It's a new one.

778
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,775
Why does she carry an empty zipper bag?

779
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,860
Anything else?

780
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,696
This powder
is a new type of LSD drugs.

781
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,780
Any footprints?

782
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,407
It's 11-inch hiking boots.

783
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,325
We confirmed its brand

784
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,578
but over 120,000 pairs
were sold last year,

785
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,704
so it's meaningless.

786
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,497
I see.

787
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,124
How about bloodstains?

788
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,418
There were only diluted ones
around the body.

789
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,545
And fingerprints on the champagne glass.

790
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,591
Okay, thanks.

791
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,676
- Yes.
- Good job.

792
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,977
Jeez...

793
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,355
Anything from the security camera?

794
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,565
We found a suspect.

795
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,207
They went in together,

796
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,251
and after an hour,

797
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,712
he came out alone.

798
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,218
Huh?

799
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,557
He's the youngest son of DN Media.

800
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,185
We know that.

801
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,313
His fingerprints
were found on the glass.

802
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,358
DN Media...

803
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,568
Jung Ina shot the CF of that company.

804
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,195
Right. A week ago.

805
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,323
You must not know this.

806
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,534
Another model was going to shoot it

807
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,119
but was replaced by Jung Ina.

808
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,622
Police officers are not capable enough
to find that out, right?

809
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,415
I found it out from other models.

810
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,042
I'm interested in this field.

811
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,252
Who owns this yacht?

812
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,213
- Cheon Taesung?
- No, Cheon Taeyoung.

813
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,297
His elder brother.

814
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,258
I heard a rumor about them--

815
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,135
Let's see Taesung first.

816
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,302
Where is he now?

817
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,387
That's...

818
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,513
unknown.

819
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,432
He didn't go to work,
and his secretary can't reach him.

820
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,811
This picture was uploaded
on his SNS an hour ago,

821
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,688
but I don't know where it is.

822
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,817
Where's this?

823
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,405
Uh?

824
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,784
Oh, my gosh.

825
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,037
I know where it is. Gosh...

826
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,712
What's wrong with that punk?

827
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,547
He'll catch the culprit by himself.

828
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:59,176
And if he fails,
he'll move to desk duty.

829
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,261
- Kyungjin.
- Yes.

830
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,804
Find out where it is quickly.

831
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,306
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

832
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,275
You're here, sir.

833
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,796
Mr. Jin, it's been a long time.

834
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,423
Yeah, I've been busy.

835
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,595
Where to, sir?

836
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,186
I'm here to see Cheon Taesung of DN.

837
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,731
This way to the tanning room.

838
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,691
Oh, I'll go see him by myself.

839
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,243
-What's up?
-It's me.

840
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,537
Damn it.

841
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,664
"Cheon Taeseong
DN Group's third son"

842
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,541
You know who I am, right?

843
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,627
Of course. You're a troublemaker of Hansu.

844
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,838
It's you who is a troublemaker.

845
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,381
I am...

846
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,592
the detective.

847
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,096
You're a detective?

848
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,556
Wow.

849
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,974
Shit.

850
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,061
Look how nonchalant you are.

851
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,148
You felt like tanning after murdering?

852
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,818
Yes.

853
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,490
Argh... Wait.

854
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,242
Police.

855
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,578
We're here to find someone.
Let me get in.

856
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,248
This place is only for members.

857
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,335
Stop talking about that freaking members!

858
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,587
I'll just go in and get him.

859
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,213
I hope you cooperate.

860
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,091
Come back with a warrant.

861
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,012
You think I can't?

862
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,806
Do it if you can.

863
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,311
Cheon Taesung is here, right?

864
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,775
Hey, wait.

865
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,028
You're arrested for Jung Ina's murder.

866
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,237
Well...

867
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,948
You can remain silent,

868
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,076
and challenge the properness of arrest...

869
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,160
Hey, Mr. Park!

870
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,953
Mr. Park! Mr. Park!

871
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,539
- Mr. Park for what?
- Mr. Park, hurry up!

872
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,376
Goddamn it.

873
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,253
What about Jin Isoo?

874
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,507
Jin Isoo from Hansu Group. You let him in?

875
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,222
Gosh...

876
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,475
It's so embarrassing.

877
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,145
Oh, you're here.

878
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,022
What the hell did you do?

879
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,315
I got Cheon Taesung.

880
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,900
There he comes.

881
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,819
Damn.

882
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,492
Get away, punk.

883
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,244
Hey.

884
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,081
Go kill him.

885
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,542
Police. Back off.

886
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,510
Hey, what are you doing?

887
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,096
Just go smash that punk!

888
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,222
Stay behind me.

889
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,891
I'm a good fighter.

890
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,976
Then, you handle it.

891
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,190
Go ahead.

892
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,992
Hey, give me something.

893
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,243
You said you're good.

894
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,454
Only for a 1 to 1 fight.

895
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,538
What?

896
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,582
I'm only used to a 1 to 1 match.

897
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,125
Stick behind me.

898
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,822
Damn it.

899
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,211
What are you doing?

900
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,299
Hey, no one can beat
against a group attack like that.

901
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,227
Call me when you need help.

902
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,478
How confident.

903
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,484
"A rich cop who catches a rich son?"

904
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,194
Special Thanks to Park Bokyung

905
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,679
Stop behaving mean
and keep your dignity.

906
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,888
It looks weird.

907
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,432
This is not the way
a conglomerate family works.

908
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,934
One of your sons

909
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,727
seems to have killed Jung Ina.

910
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,021
It's Taeyoung.
He does drugs in the yacht.

911
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,107
So scared that I pushed her.

912
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,942
What did you talk about?

913
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,860
Not much. I don't remember.

914
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,822
Young girls
who have eyes on a rich man

915
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:36,948
still exist.

916
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,199
There's something more.

917
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,243
I found out something huge.

918
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,619
They're running.

919
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,745
They applied to leave.

920
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,163
He's the culprit.

921
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,498
Stay tuned for bonus clip

922
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,047
-Hello.
-Mr. Choi.

923
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,591
Where are you?

924
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,259
I'm reading nearby.

925
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,885
I'm moving out.

926
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,430
To where?

927
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,681
You know the place

928
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,808
which has no relation to Hansu.

929
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,101
My own house.

930
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,979
Okay.

931
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,149
I'll prepare for it.

932
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,906
