00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,901
"Jin Isoo
by Ahn Bohyun"

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,530
"Lee Ganghyun
by Park Jihyun"

3
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,117
"Park Junyoung by Kang Sangjun
Choi Kyungjin by Kim Shinbi"

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,792
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,133
- Yes?
- The one who bought the scarf

7
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,259
was Kwon Dojun.

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>I talked with the seller.</i>

9
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,429
Check where he is and tell me.

10
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,764
Call Junyoung, too.

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,311
So, I took an X-ray of this painting.

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,022
Then I found this.

13
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,403
There's a signature that is not Mr. Noh's.

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,614
Under Mr. Noh's painting,

15
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,866
why is your signature hidden?

16
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,396
Drop that.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,399
You got pale
when you're the one who hit me.

18
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,319
Stop right there and drop that, okay?

19
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,862
I don't want to hit you.

20
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,948
I learned MMA professionally.

21
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,378
Now, tell me.

22
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,255
Why did you do that?

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,007
Damn.

24
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,760
Damn it.

25
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,095
It's been ten years.

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,141
<i>For ten years,</i>

27
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
<i>I've painted for him.</i>

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>While hiding my signatures</i>

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,773
<i>to mark that these are my paintings.</i>

30
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,569
<i>I watched him become famous using my work,</i>

31
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,863
<i>did errands for his wife,</i>

32
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,657
<i>and took my colleague's paintings away.</i>

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>Even when Yeseon killed herself,</i>

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,662
<i>I just ignored it and kept holding out.</i>

35
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>Oh, Mr. Kwon</i>

36
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>is to get scholarship to study abroad?</i>

37
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>Jeez... I don't know</i>

38
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,630
<i>how to say it.</i>

39
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>Actually, the portfolio that he submitted</i>

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,926
<i>was all plagiarized.</i>

41
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>As an honest educator,</i>

42
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,016
<i>I think I have to tell you this.</i>

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>- I'll get going, sir.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,313
<i>I've held out for my dream</i>

45
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,273
<i>to succeed as a great artist.</i>

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,153
Damn.

47
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,863
It's all over now.

48
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,575
That's disappointing.

49
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,702
I always envied artists

50
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,581
because they seemed
to work hard for their dreams

51
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,041
no matter how hard it was.

52
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,003
But you tried to use Mr. Noh
for your success

53
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,797
and then killed him after failing in it.

54
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,259
What did you say?

55
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,261
Why is that painting your work?

56
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,348
It became famous because it was published
in the name of Noh.

57
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>You hid behind that name</i>
<i>and added your signature secretly.</i>

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,853
- How pathetic.
- What do you know about me?

59
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,855
What the hell do you know?

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,983
You have everything you want,

61
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,276
and you can do anything.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,694
But I can't.

63
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,488
You lived like that for ten years.

64
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,950
It's too long for you to say
you're free of blame.

65
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,285
Stand up.

66
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,622
I don't have handcuffs now,
but don't think about running away.

67
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,463
Kwon.

68
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,182
Jin?

69
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,600
What's going on?

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,310
- He stabbed himself.
- Move.

71
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,487


72
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,787


73
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,623
Jin, that punk.

74
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,166
He needs some discipline.

75
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,295
I'll talk to him.

76
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,505
Follow the ambulance, please.

77
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,551
I'll call you.

78
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,692
Why were you here?

79
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,946
Well...

80
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,157
I bought a painting of Mr. Noh

81
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,326
and found something weird on it.

82
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
So?

83
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,123
I took an X-ray of it
and found a signature

84
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,042
which I had seen here.

85
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,126
So?

86
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,755
So...

87
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,049
I came here to find out what was going on.

88
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,889
How did Kwon Dojun

89
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,767
get to stab himself?

90
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,562
Oh, that's just...

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,857
He told me about his sob story,
so I scolded him.

92
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,901
I was also hit here.

93
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,569
He attacked me first.

94
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,909
I knew you were immature and rude,

95
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,037
but you're worse than I thought.

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,624
I didn't expect he would do that.

97
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,377
We caught the criminal,
and he wasn't hurt that much.

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,961
Do you still find it funny?

99
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,421
Someone is injured.

100
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,299
You know, I didn't intend this.

101
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,717
I just didn't expect it.

102
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,303
A cop must expect that
and take the responsibility.

103
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,847
Fine, I'll take the responsibility.

104
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,973
The police

105
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,102
never work individually
but as an organization.

106
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,229
You still don't understand that.

107
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,446
I don't have
any power or right to reject you.

108
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,407
I should lead you as your team leader.

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,491
It feels like

110
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,451
I have a bomb on my head.

111
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,746
After the election,

112
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,499
you'll be gone, which is my only hope.

113
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,424
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,801
Ganghyun.

115
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,595
Am I asking for too much?

116
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,139
Just stop making trouble!

117
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,766
You can't even watch Jin Isoo?

118
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,144
What if the mayor candidate's son
got hurt?

119
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,856
What if he was stabbed and killed
by the criminal?

120
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,733
I'm sorry, sir.

121
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,362
Sir.

122
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
You should depart now.

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,829
Who made this punk a team leader?

124
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,551
Just move to another station.

125
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,261
You're making too much fuss here.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,763
Why should I do that?

127
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,143
You know the reason

128
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,770
why I hate you, right?

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,191
You can't hide

130
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,901
where you come from.

131
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,239
My father was just framed.

132
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,533
You're misunderstanding about him.

133
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
You know who my father is.

134
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,124
You know him very well.

135
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,460
He was your direct supervisor.

136
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,674
You never know someone's true sides.

137
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,885
I learned it while working in this field.

138
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,765
You'd better

139
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,017
stop shielding your father

140
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,812
and face the case realistically.

141
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,904
Are you okay?

142
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,325
You look tired.

143
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,743
Stayed up all night?

144
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,827
No, it's not that.

145
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,787
I had some stuff to think about.

146
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,664
Let's go checkup.

147
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,625
I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

148
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
Get prepared to go out.

149
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,004
Let's go.

150
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,883
Jeez... I'm fine.

151
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,475
On that day,

152
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,186
I came out

153
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,522
and headed back in through the back door.

154
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,150
<i>Near the back door,</i>

155
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,985
<i>there's no security camera.</i>

156
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,030
<i>And I stabbed him.</i>

157
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,162
<i>Gosh, You punk.</i>

158
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,413
<i>I was so scared</i>

159
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>that I just ran away.</i>

160
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,421
Is that all?

161
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,715
Yes.

162
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,967
What about the paint?

163
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,594
That was not me.

164
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,597
<i>I went back to beg him to forgive me</i>

165
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,725
<i>or reveal</i>
<i>that those paintings were all mine.</i>

166
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>But then, I found him dead.</i>

167
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,816
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

168
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,818
<i>I was out of my mind and crashed a car.</i>

169
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,695
And the paint case suddenly hit me.

170
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,572
I didn't stab him deeply.

171
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,449
I thought it was possible

172
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,702
that Yeseon's mother
killed him to revenge.

173
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,871
You came back because you
could frame her as the murderer?

174
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,381
Our assumption is different.

175
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,219
We think you planned
to disguise as Oh Gyeongsun

176
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,431
and kill Mr. Noh in the first place.

177
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,142
No, it was just an impulsive behavior.

178
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,893
Then, why did you buy the scarf?

179
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,354
Sca...

180
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,772
Scarf?

181
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,068
This scarf.

182
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,779
You bought it to disguise
as Oh Gyeongsun, right?

183
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,283
September 13th in Saseok-dong.

184
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,118
We confirmed that you bought it.

185
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,120
Wait. September...

186
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
September 13th.

187
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,459
Oh, that was an errand for Mr. Noh's wife.

188
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,669
She told me to pick up the stuff.

189
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,795
So I got her that.

190
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,422
Was that a scarf?

191
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,802
If you didn't kill him,

192
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,764
why did you stab yourself?

193
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,183
I stabbed Noh anyway,

194
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,186
and my life is over now.

195
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,073
Then, Joo Hwayoung was the culprit?

196
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,743
She may have planned it

197
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,330
after setting the day
for replacing the security cameras.

198
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,000
She let Kwon buy the scarf
and disguised as Oh Gyeongsun.

199
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,503
She took a taxi on purpose.

200
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,463
But

201
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,007
she didn't expect Kwon
to stab him before her.

202
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,802
<i>Honey...</i>

203
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,720
<i>Call an ambulance for me.</i>

204
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,555
<i>Kwon Dojun</i>

205
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,224
<i>just stabbed me.</i>

206
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,207
<i>But we have no evidence</i>
<i>to prove it.</i>

207
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>Kwon Dojun, the only witness</i>

208
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,877
is another suspect.

209
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,671
So, what do we do now?

210
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,384
Joo Hwayoung.

211
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,052
Let's investigate her again.

212
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,071
Everything is normal.

213
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,866
I told you, I didn't need this.

214
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,410
The chairman was worried about you.

215
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,162
Seems like he's so desperate
to be the mayor

216
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,206
that he even plays a good father.

217
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,208
- The chairman is just--
- I'll get going.

218
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,419
I'm busy investigating a murder case.

219
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,920
How's your work

220
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
as a police officer?

221
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,216
It's so fun.

222
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
I'm off.

223
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,181
Call me if you have a headache
or feel dizzy.

224
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,433
Okay.

225
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,691
Hello, sir.

226
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,903
I let him get a checkup,
and everything is normal.

227
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,779
Okay. Thank you.

228
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,914
"Detective Jin, severely injured,
arrested the gallery murder case suspect"

229
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,418
<i>Come for a bribe.</i>

230
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,711
Wow, awesome!

231
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,177
I'll do it myself.

232
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,511
Thanks.

233
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,430
Enjoy.

234
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,140
Never had such a tasty bribe.

235
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,392
By the way,

236
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,977
what do you think?

237
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,687
Did I do something wrong?

238
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
Something wrong? You?

239
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,065
Yes.

240
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,108
Ganghyun was mad at me so much.

241
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,152
Want me to list your faults up

242
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,696
- from your first day?
- No.

243
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,031
From yesterday.

244
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,867
You acted without reporting anyone.
That's the problem.

245
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,328
I just went there to ask something.

246
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,039
You must share anything
related to the investigation.

247
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,084
Ms. Lee decides how to investigate.
You should've told her.

248
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,460
<i>If you find out anything,</i>

249
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,711
<i>report me first.</i>

250
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,380
<i>Don't do anything alone.</i>

251
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,839
And the suspect was injured.

252
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,841
Ganghyun might be punished for that.

253
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,594
He just stabbed himself.
Why would she be punished?

254
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,346
That's how an organization works.

255
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,598
And she is somewhat hated
by her superiors.

256
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,058
Why is she hated?

257
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,936
Didn't you say
she's the youngest inspector ever?

258
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
Yes, absolutely.

259
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,190
She arrested 34 vicious criminals
for only three years.

260
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,150
But there is a story behind her.

261
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,944
What story?

262
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,153
Well...

263
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm not the one to tell you.

264
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,118
Ask her yourself later
when you two get close.

265
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,369
Hmm...

266
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,413
Excuse me.

267
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,289
Get me what I ordered earlier.

268
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,001
I bought a winery last year.

269
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,085
This is from there.

270
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,837
How much is this wine?

271
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,463
It's 3.2 million won.

272
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,715
Open it, please.

273
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,758
Wow.

274
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,180
This is the one I could never reject.

275
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265
I'll try some.

276
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,186
Her father worked
in the Violent Crime field for 30 years.

277
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,354
He was called "Hook."

278
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,273
He was a legendary figure.

279
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,483
- And then?
- And then...

280
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
a few months before his retirement,

281
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,362
<i>he was caught</i>
<i>for accepting a bribe.</i>

282
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>How much was that?</i>

283
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,907
<i>Maybe it was a box full of cash.</i>

284
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,410
He was dismissed for that.

285
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,078
So what?

286
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,872
It can't be a reason to hate her.

287
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,206
They don't think so.

288
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,875
Even worse, our chief

289
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,544
<i>was a hearing inspector</i>
<i>who investigated that case.</i>

290
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,591
But Ms. Lee is managing
to endure all of these.

291
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,135
Superiors hate her,

292
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,678
and people badmouth her.

293
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,473
She even became a team leader
at such a young age,

294
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,183
making some of them jealous.

295
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,148
But there's one more problem.

296
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,486
The real culprit seems to be Joo Hwayoung.

297
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,741
Make it clear.

298
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,910
- Are you in or not?
- In.

299
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,217
Mr. Kwon.

300
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,470
You'll be moved to a VIP room.

301
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,931
What?

302
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,058
VIP room. We're transferring you now.

303
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,273
This way, please.

304
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,803
"We hope you get well
Hansu Group"

305
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,601
This room looks so clean and nice.

306
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,061
This is only for VIP patients.

307
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,274
I'll pay all the cost for these.

308
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,650
Don't worry about that.

309
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,694
You're here to apologize?

310
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,571
No.

311
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,031
I won't apologize.

312
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,327
For physical and mental damage,
you can claim compensation from me.

313
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,078
I'll give you as much as you want.

314
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
Or study abroad with that money.

315
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,833
Study abroad? I'm going to jail.

316
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,961
You didn't cause him a deadly wound.

317
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,049
If you write a sincere letter of apology,
the judge may go easy on you.

318
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,843
Is his wife the culprit?

319
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,055
It seems so,

320
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,140
but we don't have evidence.

321
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,149
Oh.

322
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,443
Then...

323
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,695
didn't you find a key

324
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,572
from Mr. Noh's clothes?

325
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,716
Need a plastic bag?

326
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,801
No, it's fine.

327
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,351
"Jin Isoo"

328
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,772
He's so annoying.

329
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,289
This is full of cheese.

330
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>Ms. Lee. I found out a new fact!</i>

331
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,731
Have breakfast.

332
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,232
I'm not hungry.

333
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,693
But you should eat some before you go.

334
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,323
- I'm off.
- Wait.

335
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
Deliver it to the house
across the street on your way.

336
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,788
- Why?
- You have to ask?

337
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,333
Our neighbor has nothing to eat
in his place.

338
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,751
No, I won't do that.

339
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,086
You never say yes to me at once.

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,338
Take it and deliver it.

341
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,548
Mom.

342
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,258
You don't know who that guy is?

343
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,594
You don't have to worry about him at all.

344
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,095
Why?

345
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,972
Is he someone famous?

346
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,435
I hope you sometimes watch the news

347
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,561
other than dramas.

348
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,189
News is always boring and gloomy.

349
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,107
Dramas are much more interesting.

350
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm leaving.

351
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,402
Who's that guy?

352
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,029
Is he famous?

353
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,626
What's up?

354
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,961
It stinks more than usual today.

355
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,550
Oh, morning coffee for you, Ms. Lee.

356
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,055
I couldn't reach you yesterday.

357
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,890
You didn't ignore my call, right?

358
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,559
Why are you suddenly being polite?

359
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,104
I found new information
to arrest Joo Hwayoung.

360
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,403
- What's that?
- I met Kwon Dojun yesterday.

361
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,487
You met whom?

362
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,114
Not for investigation.

363
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,241
I just visited him to see if he's okay.

364
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,744
So?

365
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,872
He said Mr. Noh
always carried a key at his waist.

366
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>It was a key for his private safe.</i>

367
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,377
<i>Joo once asked Kwon to steal it from Noh.</i>

368
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,548
There was no key at the scene.

369
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,049
Because Joo took it.

370
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,552
We can arrest her with that.

371
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,392
Okay.

372
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,603
I promise I'll ask you before I move.

373
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,605
I swear.

374
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,282
After the scholarship was cancelled,

375
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,576
Mr. Kwon planned
to disguise as Oh Gyeongsun

376
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,078
and kill Mr. Noh.

377
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,874
We found evidence
that he bought the same scarf

378
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,460
as the one that Oh Gyeongsun had.

379
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,212
I heard Mr. Kwon

380
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,839
stabbed himself.

381
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,342
Yes, he did it when he was arrested,

382
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,428
and...

383
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,307
he died this morning.

384
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,267
Oh, my gosh.

385
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
Poor guy.

386
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,481
I'll get going now.

387
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,794
It's all over, Jinkyu.

388
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,379
Kwon, that punk, is dead.

389
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,924
Meet me at the bank.

390
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,759
"Haneul Bank"

391
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,764
Mr. Jin,
how can I help you?

392
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,557
Well...

393
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,697
Hello.

394
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,386
Oh, Mr. Noh
was preparing for a divorce

395
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,555
hiding his fortune here.

396
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,404


397
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,697
"Scan result"

398
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,034
I see
your clear bloody fingerprint here.

399
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,639
Do you want

400
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,016
to confess?

401
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
Hey.

402
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,655
It's not me
but that woman who killed him.

403
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,991
Confess now.

404
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,202
I told you, that woman is a murderer.

405
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,871
I have nothing to do with this--

406
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,583
Shut up, you fucking asshole!

407
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,335
Come here!

408
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,628
Jeez, that must hurt.

409
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,379
- You, asshole.
- Take her out.

410
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,423
Come here, you bastard.

411
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,634
Gosh, it's so Instagrammable.

412
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,138
- Hey, it's not me.
- Bae Jinkyu!

413
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,264
Oh, gosh!

414
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,183
Come on, she's the one who murdered him.

415
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,727
You, fucking trash. Come here!

416
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,188
Hey, she's out to kill one more.

417
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,397
Killing one more.

418
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,612
Director Lee.

419
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,906
I have a suggestion for you.

420
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,621
Thanks to you,
we hit the jackpot again, Mr. Jin.

421
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,706
The tickets are selling like a hot cake.

422
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,042
Nothing can beat the original.

423
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,878
"About Original"

424
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,091
"About Original: Lee Yeseon"

425
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,721
"Power to protect the original
is in art viewers"

426
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
Detective.

427
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,040
Oh.

428
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,380
Thank you.

429
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,173
No, no. Don't mention it.

430
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,634
Every single day
was a pain for me.

431
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,141
I think I can breathe from now on.

432
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,981
Yeseon will be so happy
in the Heaven.

433
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,901
Thank you.

434
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,154
"Lee Yeseon"

435
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,291
"About Original"

436
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,056
Let's go.

437
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,980
Huh?

438
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,565
- Seungju.
- Hey, you.

439
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,651
Why didn't you tell me you were moving?

440
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,695
It just happened suddenly.

441
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,280
Let's get in.

442
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,248
Welcome to my humble house.

443
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,167
Yes, it's really humble.

444
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,211
You're the first--

445
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,755
No.

446
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,507
You're the second guest here.

447
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,675
Have a seat.

448
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,344
Okay.

449
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,025
Here, I made a little coffee.

450
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,365
You're acting out again?

451
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,325
I'm not a child anymore.

452
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,576
That's what I'm saying.

453
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,496
Just move next to my house.

454
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,956
I've got a new one for you.

455
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,207
I like this place.

456
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,792
It doesn't suit you.

457
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,002
It's too small and uncomfortable.

458
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,380
It suits Detective Jin Isoo.

459
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,923
Oh.

460
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,300
Today,
someone called me, "Detective."

461
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,010
It sounded great.

462
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,096
- Your heart's set on it this time?
- Yes.

463
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,389
Yes, indeed.

464
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,936
<i>The Seoul mayoral election</i>
<i>is just 40 days away.</i>

465
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,939
<i>Approval ratings of Jin Myeongchul,</i>
<i>Hansu Group's chairman,</i>

466
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,233
<i>and Wang Jongtae,</i>
<i>the three-time legislator</i>

467
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,318
<i>are fighting within the margin of error.</i>

468
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,321
<i>As Jin has grown Hansu</i>
<i>for the last ten years</i>

469
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,739
<i>to be a world-class company,</i>

470
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,576
<i>people seem to place high hopes</i>
<i>on his managing skills.</i>

471
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>Next up.</i>

472
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,329
<i>Jin Myeongchul's son Jin Isoo,</i>

00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,378
<i>According to the staff,</i>

476
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,215
<i>to reveal that the paintings are</i>

477
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,595
What are you drinking?

478
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,138
I'm taking care of myself.

479
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,098
It's part of blood sugar management.

480
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,975
You never share such a good thing.

481
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,102
"Jin's '<i>Noblesse Oblige</i>'"

482
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,937
Did you receive a bribe from Hansu?

483
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,023
I could be lured for about two billion,

484
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,482
but they aren't calling me.

485
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,609
Then, what's that?

486
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,277
Why do you keep talking Jin Isoo up?

487
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,029
To humiliate him hard later.

488
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,072
A good reputation

489
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,199
leads to a more significant downfall.

490
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,368
Hey.

491
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,745
Come on.

492
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,204
I'll introduce you to someone.

493
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,883
"Kim Jeongyeon"

494
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,894
Hello.

495
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,047
The world is simpler

496
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,757
than it looks.

497
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,678
People who keep their position well

498
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,388
can manage the system.

499
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,099
Please don't be too polite.

500
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,768
You know we're scared
of reporters the most.

501
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,024
There are some guys
who try to cross the line

502
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,401
like Jin Myeongchul.

503
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,320
Why does a businessman
who only pursues money

504
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,114
want to be a politician?

505
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,490
You don't think so?

506
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,492
What do you want from me?

507
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,585
Jin Myeongchul's weak point is his son,

508
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,670
Jin Isoo.

509
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,923
Dig into him.

510
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,343
Reveal that he's an illegitimate son,

511
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,886
and...

512
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,224
how his mother died.

513
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,523
You don't have to do it now.

514
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,610
Let's drop the bombshell
three days before the election.

515
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,904
All the newspapers will report
about Jin Isoo,

516
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,656
and people will get suspicious.

517
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,535
We'll make them vote
at that moment.

518
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,032
What?

519
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,326
That's a leaf blight.

520
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,245
Oh, isn't it dead?

521
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,999
It will die if you do nothing.

522
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,001
Then, what should I do?

523
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,719
What's with him?

524
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,849
You need to spray pesticide.

525
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,184
What?

526
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,747
- Get out of the way.
- Oh.

527
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,005
I'm working with Lee Ganghyun.

528
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,215
I know. I heard it.

529
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,509
Oh, you did?

530
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,514
Is it severe?

531
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,850
Not too severe yet.

532
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,728
I was worried that it was dead.

533
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,939
It's me who planted this tree.

534
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,110
You lived here before?

535
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,154
I had lived here until I was seven,

536
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,280
and I came back now.

537
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,344
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

538
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,346
<i>Look at me.</i>

539
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,143
<i>You okay?</i>

540
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,354
<i>No, forget it.</i>

541
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,149
<i>Hey, what's up with you?</i>

542
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
<i>Hey.</i>

543
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,943
<i>I'll call ambul--</i>

544
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,822
<i>You okay?</i>

545
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,506
I'm not tall enough for this.
You spray up there.

546
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,342
Spray it again after a week.

547
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,220
Be careful not to let it stain
on your hand.

548
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,680
Thank you.

549
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,652
Eat some before you go.

550
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,532
Gosh, it's hot.

551
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,535
Your stomach aches
if you eat something cold in the morning.

552
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,123
I'm off.

553
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,252
Deliver that kimchi to him.

554
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,887
Gosh, you startled me.

555
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,393
What's this?

556
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,561
My mom sent it to you.

557
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,439
For your information,

558
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,484
this will be very salty.

559
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,611
I recommend not eating it.

560
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,574
Hurry up, or you'll be late.

561
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,076
Wait up.

562
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,832
Oh, you cleaned the car.

563
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,292
Good job.

564
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,543
Shut up.

565
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,920
Hey, it's a compliment.

566
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,049
I met your father this morning.

567
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,802
- My father?
- Yes.

568
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,555
He helped me
take care of the tree in my yard.

569
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,057
You mean, my father got into your house?

570
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,767
Right.

571
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,352
Why?

572
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
No, it's just... He hardly comes outside.

573
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,693
Heard of the exhibition?

574
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,070
What exhibition?

575
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,740
The exhibition of Lee Yeseon.

576
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,700
Haven't heard of it.

577
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,411
What kind of cop
doesn't watch the news?

578
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,204
There was an article about it.

579
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,498
Do you think
I have time to watch the news?

580
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,042
Do you?

581
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,127
Jeez, we don't click.

582
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,421
We really don't click.

583
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,342
10/5 Ugok-ro.

584
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,969
- Good morning.
- You're early.

585
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,846
Okay, I got it.

586
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,639
I'll be there soon.

587
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,143
A dead body was found in Eunbu-dong.

588
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,520
Really? Let's go.

589
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,609
What are you going to do with him?

590
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,070
Let's wait and see.
He said he'd do better.

591
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,825
Why does Park look at me like that?

592
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,410
Because he hates you.

593
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,828
I see.

594
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
I hate him, too.

595
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,515
This way for Jin,
and that way for Kyungjin.

596
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,893
Ask around every neighbor in this alley
about the victim.

597
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,270
Ask them if they saw anything suspicious.

598
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,730
Hey, hey.

599
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
- Every house here?
- Sure.

600
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,402
Start.

601
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,653
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,154
Hey...

603
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,909
How can I do it all by myself?

604
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,866
Excuse me.

605
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,242
I won't buy that.

606
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,745
No, I'm a police officer.

607
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,498
Excuse me.

608
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,505
Excuse me.

609
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,094
Police.

610
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,056
What are you doing now?

611
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,642
Oh, the tree.

612
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,144
You're planting trees, right?

613
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,231
Do you know the elderly
living across the street?

614
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,732
No, we don't.

615
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,108
Oh, you don't.

616
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,945
Why are you planting trees so scarily?

617
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,155
Is this a tree club?

618
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,210
Oh, you're here.

619
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,503
Yes. Found out anything?

620
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,587
No, not yet.

621
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,672
No?

622
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,756
We'll see.

623
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,526
I...

624
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,737
I visit here from time to time.

625
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,907
I was going to come yesterday,

626
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,994
but something came up, so I couldn't.

627
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,872
I called him this morning...

628
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,168
but he didn't answer,
so I came here and saw him.

629
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,797
Did he have

630
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,383
a chronic disease or something like that?

631
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,510
He had a hypertension

632
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,388
and arthritis, but he was healthy.

633
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,560
What was his daily life like?

634
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,853
Well...

635
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,813
He only went to church,

636
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,481
and he hardly went out.

637
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,859
I did grocery shopping

638
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,236
and cooked for him when I came here.

639
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,363
If I had been here yesterday

640
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,283
he wouldn't have died, right?

641
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,619
Currently,

642
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
it looks like an accident.

643
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,375
It's no one's fault.

644
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,925
Did you find something?

645
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,721
A rice cake
was stuck in his throat.

646
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,058
An elderly who lived alone
passed away in solitude.

647
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,894
You live alone, right?

648
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,188
Where do you live?

649
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,566
Near Gangha Station.

650
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
Oh.

651
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,903
I live around there, too.

652
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,534
It's done?

653
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,119
Yes.

654
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,372
There's nothing special.

655
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,666
Right.
No sign of forcible entry.

656
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,043
The cash in the wallet
remains untouched, too.

657
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,921
Seems like an accident.

658
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,255
Yes.

659
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,677
"No entry. Under investigation"

660
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,473
Found out anything?

661
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,933
Nothing special.

662
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,227
The victim had
no connection with neighbors.

663
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,145
All that I've found out

664
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,606
is that a scary woman lives in that house,

665
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,110
some innocent guys with tattoo
are planting trees in that house,

666
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,320
and in that house, a very scary dog--

667
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,406
Where's she going?

668
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,949
Is it finished?

669
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,328
It feels like a dog training.
It's just my feeling, right?

670
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,623
"Seoul Gangha Police Station"

671
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,024
I'm so tired.

672
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,278
Where did everybody go?

673
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,531
I should go home.

674
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,161
Excuse me.

675
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,164
Is this
the Violent Crime Investigation Team 1?

676
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,415
Yes, it is.

677
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,168
Where's Ms. Lee?

678
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,419
I was wondering, too.

679
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,130
How can I help you?

680
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,090
Are you a detective, too?

681
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,592
Oh.

682
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,135
You don't know who I am.

683
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,012
Just a moment.

684
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,558
I am a detective.

685
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,642
Jin Isoo.

686
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,521
Detective.

687
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,315
Please help me.

688
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,779
Ms. Lee!

689
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,451
This is a murder case.

690
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,662
Come over quickly.

691
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,665
What the hell?

692
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,542
He's overacting again.

693
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,252
That's what he is.

694
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,713
I'm not overacting.
I've got a secret report.

695
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,174
A secret report?
You think this is a movie?

696
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,052
The victim's granddaughter was here.

697
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,554
Said he never ate rice cake
because it's stodgy,

698
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,306
so it's impossible that he ate it.

699
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,058
- His granddaughter was here?
- Yes.

700
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,187
And she said this is missing.

701
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,271
What?

702
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,190
What's this?

703
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,525
Don't be surprised.

704
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,527
This is...

705
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,822
the seal of Korea.

706
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,906
Oh, really?

707
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,032
Yes.

708
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,374
No way.

709
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,920
The seal of Korea?

710
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,713
Wow.

711
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,925
Why is the great seal

712
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,427
in a private house?

713
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,806
Right. Maybe it's something
like a black letter weight.

714
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,015
No, it's not.

715
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,310
He told his granddaughter in secret
that it's a real great seal.

716
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,112
No way.

717
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,405
Jeez.

718
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,573
Then, why is this missing?

719
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,366
Why do you think it's missing?

720
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,619
It could be broken and thrown away,
or it was given to someone.

721
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,163
She doesn't live there,
so maybe she didn't know.

722
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,374
Someone could have broken in, killed him,

723
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,584
and taken this away.

724
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,669
This is not a robbery case.

725
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,005
There was no sign of forcible entry,

726
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,215
and the cash in his wallet wasn't touched.

727
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,386
What if I'm right?

728
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,721
What if you're wrong?

729
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,139
Can I beat you?

730
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,223
Okay, deal.

731
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,142
If I'm right, I'll beat you.

732
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,351
- Great.
- Okay.

733
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,229
I warn you. I'll beat you
on the chin very strongly.

734
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,274
There's a reason
that I learned MMA professionally.

735
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,817
Kyungjin, call an ambulance.

736
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,569
I'm a southpaw fighter!

737
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,446
Hey, you both stop it and go home.

738
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,911
Jeez...

739
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,789
Okay, let's see.

740
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,875
Just wait there.

741
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,711
Whose side should I stand on?

742
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,379
Better get back to work anyway.

743
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,176
"The great seal"

744
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,559
Mr. Choi.

745
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,395
Who was the appraiser

746
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,189
for our celadon last time?

747
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,565
Thank you.

748
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,417
"Security cameras on 24/7"

749
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,798
Excuse me.

750
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,883
Yes.

751
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,053
Hello.

752
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,889
I'm here
on Mr. Choi Jeonghun's recommendation.

753
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,516
Oh, I heard from him.

754
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:40,852
What's this?

755
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,605
This is a Goryeo celadon
called Girin Incense Burner.

756
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,149
It's a fake one.

757
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,027
Did you bring your stuff?

758
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,237
What?

759
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,073
You want me to assess your stuff, right?

760
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,700
No, I'm here for...

761
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,452
this one.

762
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:04,459
The possibility that this stuff
could be the real great seal?

763
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,669
Yes?

764
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,966
- That's possible.
- Oh my gosh.

765
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,636
The great seals that have
been produced since Joseon Dynasty

766
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,304
are a total of 412 pieces,

767
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,141
but 73 pieces of them have disappeared.

768
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,810
Many of them were taken
to Japan or the U.S.,

769
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,771
but some of them could be sold secretly.

770
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,606
And look at this.

771
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,525
Using black paint is a common method

772
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,194
employed by brokers of stolen goods
to conceal them.

773
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,904
The great seal is so special

774
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,198
that anyone can recognize
its golden color.

775
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,200
I see.

776
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,414
If this is a real one...

777
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,500
If it's real...

778
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,464
it'll be the National Seal
of Korean Empire

779
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,798
adopted by Gojong.

780
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,008
Awesome.

781
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,218
Have you ever seen a real great seal?

782
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,887
No.

783
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,264
20 years ago,

784
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,018
I only heard a rumor
that Choi Sangsoo had one of them.

785
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,728
Chairman Choi Sangsoo?

786
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,812
Yes.

787
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,980
Long time ago,

788
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,067
he ran a big trading company in Japan.

789
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,277
He passed away long ago.

790
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,987
Ah...

791
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,909
Gosh, what do I do?

792
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,339
Who's calling?

793
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,174
Detective Lee Ganghyun.

794
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,176
Excuse me.

795
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,932
Hello.

796
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,016
Are you still at work?

797
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,142
<i>Yes.</i>

798
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>What's up?</i>

799
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,979
Did you find anything weird

800
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,397
from the victim today?

801
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,484
Nothing. Why?

802
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,528
I just want to make sure.

803
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,322
<i>Elderly people usually have</i>
<i>weakened esophagus muscle,</i>

804
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,990
so such an accident is common--

805
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,203
Hold on.

806
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,087
"Autopsy result"

807
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,589
"Died from airway obstruction
"

808
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,096
"Autopsy result"

809
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,890
"Died from airway obstruction
"

810
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,436
Recently, in Eunbu-dong,

811
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,689
two more died while eating a rice cake.

812
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,941
<i>Both were closed as accidental death.</i>

813
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,693
It looks weird.

814
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,403
I'll be there soon.

815
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,828
"Kang Byeongjin, Eunbu-dong"

816
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,302
This is the one I was eating,

817
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,470
and this one was from the victim's mouth.

818
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,890
They look different, right?

819
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,268
If it's chewed by a human,
it has teeth marks like this.

820
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,811
But

821
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,479
what happened to this one?

822
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,653
Someone must've cut it
to make it look chewed.

823
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,324
That's right.

824
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,540
What about the other cases?

825
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,125
Oh.

826
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,257
"Autopsy report, NFS"

827
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,468
And all of those cases

828
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,055
were investigated by Team 2.

829
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,017
"Violent Crime Investigation Team 2"

830
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,770
"Autopsy report, NFS"

831
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,647
"Violent Crime Investigation Team 2"

832
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,662
Good morning.

833
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,420
What are you doing?

834
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,923
Why are you grinning like Joker?

835
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,634
Shut up.

836
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,010
Okay.

837
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,692
Good morning, Mr. An.

838
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,779
Jeez, you worked overtime last night.

839
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,614
You must be tired.

840
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,074
Drink this.

841
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,121
Did you poison it?

842
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,250
What a funny joke.

843
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,127
What do you want?

844
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,131
I happened to take a case,

845
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,426
and I need help
from a professional cop like you.

846
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:10,432
About the two recent death cases
due to airway obstruction in Eunbu-dong.

847
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,642
I need to see the files about them.

848
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,146
Why?

849
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,148
Because...

850
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,403
Similar case as those occurred yesterday.

851
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,865
You mean I made a mistake?

852
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,491
No, it's not that.

853
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:32,078
Three similar cases occurred
in Eunbu-dong in a month.

854
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,663
It looks weird.

855
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,958
So you're trying
to reverse your senior's cases.

856
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,921
It may be

857
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,758
- a serial murder case.
- Don't dare to touch them.

858
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,217
I'm done.

859
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,719
Get lost.

860
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,443
"victim"

861
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,866
"Death case in Eunbu-dong"

862
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,659

"Cash and valuables not stolen"

865
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,635
Eunbu-dong case.

866
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,388
Let's dig into it more.

867
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,806
What? Why?

868
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,850
She trusts what I told her.

869
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,144
I met an antiquarian,

870
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,980
and he said there are 73 pieces
of great seals missing.

871
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,441
Some of them could be in private homes.

872
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,568
I'm not sure about that,

873
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,695
but we need to check the facts.

874
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,074
There was no teeth mark on the rice cake.

875
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,700
The autopsy is going on.

876
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,494
"No sign of chewing the rice cake"

877
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,663
If these cases are connected,

878
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,665
it's a serial murder case.

879
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,543
Get more information about the victim.

880
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,337
We can't get help here
regarding the two previous cases.

881
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,549
Let's visit the local police office
and meet the bereaved family.

882
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,426
- Okay.
- I'll go to the autopsy room.

883
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,897
Hello.

884
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,067
I'm Choi Kyungjin from Gangha Station,
who called you earlier.

885
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,485
Can I get the file?

886
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,044
Were you looking for something?

887
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,382
Mother's jewelry is missing.

888
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,342
I know you hid it. Where is it?

889
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,094
I told you, it's not me!

890
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,345
Stop fighting, please.

891
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,640
Jewelry is missing?

892
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:58,850
Yes.

893
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,066
It's a fake one.

894
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,151
Yes.

895
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,445
Everything except fake ones disappeared.

896
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,824
How much is the value
of the missing stuff?

897
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,076
Maybe it's over ten million.

898
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,708
One security cam here,
and the victim's house is here.

899
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,462
Is this the only security cam around here?

900
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,630
Right.

901
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:38,973
It was here?

902
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,976
My father preferred
to keep his fortune in cash.

903
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,686
- I see.
- How much

904
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,146
was the cash kept here?

905
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,564
I don't know exactly,

906
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,067
but he also had gold,
so it would be quite a lot.

907
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,529
Did you report to the detective in charge

908
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,280
about the missing money?

909
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,657
Well...

910
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,410
We already finished his funeral,
and they said it was an accident.

911
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
It's not?

912
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,749
We're still on investigation.

913
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,376
We'll call you again.

914
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,055
"Yeongseong Family Church"

915
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,392
"Yeongseong Family Church"

916
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,854
"Yeongseong Family Church"

917
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,358
I can't believe
something like this happened.

918
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,609
Three people died

919
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,860
in a month?

920
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,821
Oh, Lord.

921
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,490
It seems that the criminal targeted them.

922
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,493
Did people around them know
that they were rich?

923
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,911
No, not at all.

924
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,413
I didn't know it, either.

925
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,373
They were always simply dressed.

926
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,667
I have never seen them
spend a lot of money.

927
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,253
Were those three close to each other?

928
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,046
I don't think so.

929
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,425
They just came here
and attended a service quietly.

930
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,847
"Autopsy result"

931
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,182
"Nicotine and zolpidem detected"

932
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,072
Here it is.

933
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,157
What did you find?

934
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,951
Here.

935
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,454
It's a needle mark.

936
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,123
It was hidden on a mole.

937
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,542
This is amazing, right?

938
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,755
So they administered nicotine

939
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,340
through injection, right?

940
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,549
Right.

941
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,718
Why are you disappointed?

942
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,803
Oh.

943
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,890
I'm going to be beaten.

944
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,266
Oh.

945
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,560
Can I also schedule a time

946
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,897
to beat you?

947
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,360
Come to me if your jaws are dislocated.

948
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,653
I'm good at fixing it.

949
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,581
How did they pick the targets?

950
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,129
There's one who can see
the devotees' financial state.

951
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,423
"Church Office"

952
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,591
The accountant.

953
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,177
An accountant could see
who paid how much tithe.

954
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,183
Excuse me.

955
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,769
Police.

956
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,857
What? Police?

957
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,527
To be honest...

958
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,531
the account book
disappeared two months ago.

959
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,367
I didn't think
it could be stolen.

960
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,828
I just thought I lost it by mistake.

961
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,371
I was afraid to be scolded,

962
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,998
so I made a new one
without telling anyone.

963
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,545
Was it because of me
that they passed away?

964
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,798
- Am I going to jail?
- No, no.

965
01:01:58,923 --> 01:01:59,924
Don't cry.

966
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,592
You're not going to jail.

967
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,679
- Everyone makes a mistake.
- I'm so sorry, Lord.

968
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,473
I don't want to go to jail.

969
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,517
"A serial murder case in Eunbu-dong"

970
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,854

01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,946

Lim Bokhee.

976
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,085
Choi Sangsoo.

977
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,338
- Choi Sangsoo?
- 20 years ago,

978
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,925
<i>I only heard a rumor</i>
<i>that Choi Sangsoo had one of them.</i>

979
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,554
Choi Sangsoo.
I heard he had a great seal in his house.

980
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,348
Look, I was right.
It was a real great seal.

981
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:53,686
He knew it was illegal to possess it,
so he didn't report that it was stolen.

982
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,484
How did it go?

983
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,861
They're professional.

984
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,905
Zolpidem was detected in his stomach,

985
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,073
and the cause of death
is acute nicotinism.

986
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,284
They injected it secretly
through the mole.

987
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,126
What the hell?

988
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,003
Beat me.

989
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,630
What?

990
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,715
Oh, that deal?

991
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,343
Okay. I'll beat you on your chin.

992
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,677
Clench your teeth, okay?

993
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,429
Okay, I'll do it.

994
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,683
Like this? Gosh.

995
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,269
What are you doing?

996
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,814
I'll keep it.

997
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,441
I'll beat you when you're not alert.

998
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,734
Do it now.

999
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,110
Quickly.

1000
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,320
You want it now?

1001
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,113
You both stop it.

1002
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,908
Are you children?

1003
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,369
No.

1004
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,038
- It's Park who first--
- Stay focused.

1005
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,331
Three people died.

1006
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,128
Victims were all going to the same church,

1007
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,463
and the culprit

1008
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,048
used the stolen account book

1009
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,383
to choose the targets.

1010
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,344
- Security cam?
- I found the suspects.

1011
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,221
But due to a low camera quality,

1012
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,140
I can't identify the faces
and the number plate.

1013
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,102
They entered the house in daylight.

1014
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,229
Did the victim open the door?

1015
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,235
What are they holding in his hands?

1016
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,953
By the way, is it common these days

1017
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,582
to take a funeral photo at home?

1018
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,212
Look.

1019
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,714

in Gangha Station.

1023
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:05,860
May I ask how Mr. Gang Byeongjin
took his funeral photo?

1024
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,279
- For free?
- Okay.

1025
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,780
Thank you for cooperation.

1026
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,157
Thank you.

I heard the same thing.

1030
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,796

to the security cam.

01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,326
They planned it thoroughly.

1042
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,120
I heard you can find me anything.

1043
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,454
I got the great seal!

1044
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,124
The secret auction starting at 2:00 a.m.

- Stop the car.
It's one billion won.

who can cope with any situation.

Can we?

01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,612
