CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,976
Mom died
from a sleeping pill overdose,

7
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,813
but she had no sleeping pill.

8
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,692
There was no pill.

9
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,235
What?

10
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,404
What do you mean?

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,282
I hid it away from her.

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,788
Mom...

13
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
didn't killed herself, right?

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,424
What did you do...

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,761
to my mom?

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,727
You couldn't let

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,813
the woman you kicked out

18
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,482
raise your son secretly?

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,817
No way!

20
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,529
I was going to get divorced.

21
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,865
I wanted to start again with her.

22
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,160
I was going to live
with you and your mom here.

23
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,458
The chairman of Hansu wanted to live

24
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,253
in a place like this

25
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,380
with an unmarried mother?

26
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
Yes.

27
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,801
I was going to give up everything.

28
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,053
Because I realized
what truly mattered to me.

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
Please...

30
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,890
Please...

31
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,643
Just once!

32
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,065
Just once,

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,863
tell me the truth, please.

34
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,500
I told you everything I wanted to say.

35
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,840
Believe it or not,

36
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,009

00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,484
are the worst ever.

39
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,024
It's me, sir.

40
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,946
Sir.

41
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,366
Sir?

42
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534

51
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,498
has passed away.

52
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,682
Jin?

53
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901
Please help me.

54
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,574
I found a secret space

55
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,538
where I used to hide my stuff
when I was young.

56
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,003
There were mom's sleeping pills

57
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,883
prepared on the day of her death.

58
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,220
What...

59
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,597
What do you mean?

60
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,392
I mean, it was not suicide.

61
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,937
Mom didn't have sleeping pills.

62
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,106
I hid the bottle away.

63
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,195
Someone visited my house on that day,

64
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,867
but I don't remember who it was.

65
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,871
I looked through all the files,
but I couldn't find anything.

66
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,167
Please check it out for me.

67
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,712
The detective in charge

68
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
was Captain Lee.

69
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,512
Mr. Jin.

70
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,308
We're from Seoul Metropolitan Police.

71
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,851
Can we talk for a minute?

72
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,644
What's up?

73
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,072
Let's go somewhere private.

74
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,765
What's going on?

75
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,974
No idea.

76
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,864
Father...

77
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,495
Wait.

78
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,081
What are you talking about?

79
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,290
As of now,

80
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,668
it seems that he committed suicide.

81
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,006
Melted sleeping pills were found
in the liquor bottle.

82
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,053
The estimated time of death

83
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,013
is 2:00 a.m.

84
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,644
Yesterday,

85
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,938
you met him, right?

86
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,031
You came at 11:30 p.m. by cab,

87
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,157
and left the villa

88
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,494
at around 12:00 a.m.

89
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,790
What did you talk about?

90
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,128
Did you notice

91
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,880
any sign of suicide from him?

92
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,816
Reporters are waiting outside.

93
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,198
Let's go to the house.

94
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,908
Okay?

95
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,755
Jin Isoo is here! He's coming.

96
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,423
Move.

97
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,508
Stop shooting.

98
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
Back off.

99
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,845
You knew that he passed away?

100
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,472
You met him last night.

101
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,973
What did you talk about?

102
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,435
Both of your parents committed suicide.

103
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,519
How do you feel?

104
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,778
Move.

105
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,197
Excuse us.

106
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,125
Back off.

107
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,796
Everyone, leave.

108
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,422
Leave now.

109
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,049
Leave.

110
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,426
Dismiss.

111
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,973
Why?

112
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,767
Was that a right question?

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,478
Hey, I hit the nail on the head.

114
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,272
I'm so embarrassed
that a trash like you is a reporter.

115
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,486
Gosh.

116
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,696
They're from Seoul Metropolitan Police.

117
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,325
When did you last see the deceased?

118
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,079
The last time I saw him

119
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,043
was when he left for his villa
after the press conference.

120
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,590
He wanted to be alone,

121
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,511
so I didn't follow him.

122
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,354
What did you say?

123
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,483
What the hell?

124
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,692
Are you crazy?

125
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,028
Jin Myeongchul,
the chairman of Hansu,

126
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,281
who resigned from the mayor candidacy
due to an illegitimate issue,

127
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,325
was found dead in his villa

128
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,868
in Seonganju-si this morning.

129
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,203
Kim Taehun is reporting.

130
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,579
- No.
- This morning,

131
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,581
-in the villa in Seonganju-si,
-No.

132
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,374
-owned by Chairman Jin,
-No, no...

133
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,460
Chairman Jin Myeongchul was found dead.

134
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,838
Police assume
that Chairman Jin committed suicide

135
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,300
after suffering
from the pressure of the public.

136
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,345
His body was first found
by his secretary Kang,

137
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,681
who visited his villa this morning.

138
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
Jin Myeongchul has been leading
Hansu Group since 1997

139
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,436
when he was inaugurated
as the chairman.

140
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,480
Recently, he ran for the Seoul mayor...

141
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,904
What did you do...

142
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,324
to my mom?

143
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,702
You...

144
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,122
are the worst ever.

145
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,769
Come out if you're ready.

146
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,129
Ma'am.

147
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
It's all your fault.

148
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,883
You trashy bastard.

149
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,593
What did you say?

150
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,636
What the hell did you say to him?

151
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,430
-Ma'am, calm down, please.
-You...

152
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,892
and your mom... Why do you make me crazy?

153
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,103
You killed my husband in the end.

154
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,646
You...

155
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,400
Seungju, kick him out of here.

156
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,735
Mom.

157
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,154
He killed your father.

158
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,238
Mom!

159
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,327
Stop it.

160
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,208
Please leave.

161
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,169
I'll handle everything here.

162
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,629
Seungju.

163
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
Escort her.

164
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,382
Seungju?

165
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,885
My son.

166
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,272
Take her to the hospital.

167
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,109
Don't let her out.

168
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,284
I'm sorry.

169
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,996
Mom

170
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,415
is very sensitive now.

171
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,671
Look up.

172
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,051
You're the son of Chairman Jin.

173
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,372
"The deceased, Jin Myeongchul"

174
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,624
"Sons: Jin Seungju, Jin Isoo
Wife: Cho Heeja"

175
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,762
We respectfully express
our condolences.

176
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,396
Bro.

177
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,107
I'm so sorry.

178
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,810
I don't think I can sleep.

179
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,564
Can you believe this?

180
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,777
I don't understand him.

181
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,202
You'll never know the pressure

182
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,747
of Chairman's position of Hansu Group.

183
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,250
Of course,

184
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,418
I don't exactly know it, either.

185
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,923
But I can imagine
how it would be.

186
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,301
He must have felt a lot of pressure

187
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,179
while going through the election.

188
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,559
I thought

189
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,314
Father was strong enough.

190
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,948
Isoo.

191
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,244
There's no one who is strong enough

192
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,997
to beat everything.

193
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,588
Your room is still there.

194
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,300
If you don't mind,

195
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,430
how about staying with me at home
for a while?

196
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
By the way,

197
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,689
why did you meet him on the day?

198
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,784
I had something to talk to him.

199
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,703
About what?

200
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,124
I'll tell you later.

201
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,769
You're home.

202
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,481
Didn't Isoo come together?

203
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,525
No.

204
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,071
I wanted to go to the funeral,

205
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,074
but I felt I shouldn't be there.

206
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,993
I've been there.

207
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,163
Is he okay?

208
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,210
Maybe not.

209
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,171
I hope I could cook a meal for him
someday.

210
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,508
You might not have a chance to do that.

211
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
When I was as small as you,

212
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,739
your grandpa gave me a compass as well.

213
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,326
What do you think it means?

214
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,661
I should choose the right way?

215
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,954
Right.

216
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,164
That's what it means.

217
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,808
The time we spent together,

218
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,518
that sunshine,

219
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,521
and even that air
are all unforgettable to me.

220
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
Even for a short moment together,

221
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,525
you gave me peace.

222
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,155
I know it's too late,
but please give me another chance.

223
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,325
Like this picture,
let's smile and grow old together.

224
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,454
I also want to be a good father for Isoo.

225
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,628
Mom shouldn't have died like that.

226
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,590
It's you who killed her.

227
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,049
Don't dare say that again!

228
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,053
She was the woman I loved.

229
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,515
I wanted to be a good father.

230
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,225
That's why I let you in.

231
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,436
I was going to live

232
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,354
with you and your mom here.

233
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,316
I wanted to start again with her.

234
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,172
"Look further and choose the right way"

235
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,318
Please take
a moment of silence.

236
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,405
Thank you.

237
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,621
You should take over the company
as soon as possible.

238
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,916
That's the only way
to settle everything down.

239
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,464
Since 1997,
the deceased, Jin Myeongchul,

240
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,715
has led Hansu Group.

241
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,343
Until he passed away,
not only in economic field...

242
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,262
Isoo looks the coolest when he smiles.

243
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,764
He entered politics
at the age of 60,

244
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,932
and bravely ran for...

245
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,725
I don't understand.

246
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,519
Why did the chairman do that

247
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,063
while preparing
for the mayor election?

248
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,940
Wealth and honor

249
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,817
don't always ensure one's happiness.

250
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,152
He might have felt a lot of pressure.

251
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,158
I mean, it was not suicide.

252
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,077
Mom didn't have sleeping pills.

253
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,371
I hid the bottle away.

254
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,417
I need to go somewhere.

255
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
Sleeping pills?

256
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,385
Yes.

257
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,762
Did you see any pills

258
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,056
or a medicine bottle at the scene?

259
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,392
I don't think so.

260
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,897
No.

261
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,566
I didn't.

262
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,817
Isn't it weird?

263
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,611
Well...

264
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,031
Yes, it is.

265
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,492
Usually, the pills are found
around the body.

266
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,704
Even if he went there to kill himself...

267
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,914
Where did he get those pills?

268
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,086
Did he used to take them daily?

269
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,803
From now on,

270
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,097
as a representative of the chairman,

271
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,725
I'll read Chairman Jin Myeongchul's will.

272
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,186
It is estimated
that the chairman's stock assets

273
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,937
of Hansu Group and its affiliates

274
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,773
amount to about 11 trillion won.

275
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,651
Real estate assets,
including a house in Pyeongjin-dong

276
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,402
covering 593 square yards,

277
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,029
amount to about one trillion won.

278
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,531
Cash equivalents such as stock dividends

279
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,741
amount to about 5 trillion won.

280
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,203
Including the artworks
that he has collected in his entire life,

281
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,997
the total amount is estimated
to reach 20 trillion won.

282
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,167
Among these,
the stock asset part will be...

283
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,672
I should get going.

284
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,801
You handle this as you want.

285
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,440
What happened to you?

286
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,733
"Kim Seonyoung"

287
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,194
I want to know the truth,

288
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,866
but I don't know what to do.

289
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,503
I got a call from Chairman Jin

290
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,047
on the day of his death.

291
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,802
He said

292
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,179
he wanted to revise his will.

293
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,516
He changed his mind for some reason,

294
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,228
but now I can't ask him what it was.

295
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,985
Isoo, you're here.

296
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,403
You want a drink?

297
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
It's almost done. Wait.

298
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,080
Okay.

299
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,627
Why the long face again?

300
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,921
What's up?

301
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,882
Hey.

302
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,009
Isn't this the case of Jin's mother?

303
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,886
Right.

304
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,971
Why?

305
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,890
Did you find sleeping pills
left at the scene?

306
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,643
Sleeping pills?

307
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,937
No, I didn't.

308
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,065
There was a prescription for it, though.
Why?

309
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,692
It's weird.

310
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,277
What's weird?

311
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,279
If she took the pills,

312
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,780
-Yes.
-there should have been

313
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,448
pills or a bottle left at the scene.

314
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,370
But Isoo said she didn't have pills.

315
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,793
It was 25 years ago.

316
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,378
He lost his mom then.

317
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,589
Do you believe his memory?

318
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,008
There was nothing left

319
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,677
around the chairman's body, either.

320
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,848
Really?

321
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,517
Someone

322
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,395
could've put the pills into his liquor.

323
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,872
Can I talk to you now?

324
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,922
Jin.

325
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,175
-Hey.
-Hey.

326
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,635
Have you been waiting long?

327
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,219
No.

328
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,181
Gosh, it's cold.

329
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,308
Let's go eat something.

330
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,022
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go.

331
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,359
Come on.

332
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,698
Looks yummy.

333
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,910
Thank you.

334
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,078
Please enjoy.

335
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,544
I have something to tell you.

336
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,007
Let's eat first.

337
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,347
Come on.

338
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,891
I'll listen to you after eating.

339
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,143
Okay?

340
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,949
It's good.

341
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,455
Try this one.

342
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,041
Try some veges

343
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,126
with this.

344
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,927
Sundubujjigae here is really good.

345
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,971
Try it, okay?

346
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,394
Try it with the broth.

347
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,989
Now, you look much better.

348
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,076
What do you want to tell me?

349
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,831
You said melted pills were found

350
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,708
in his liquor bottle, right?

351
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,502
Right.

352
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,091
He poured me that liquor.

353
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,260
He wanted to drink with me.

354
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
You want a drink?

355
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,766
No father gives liquor

356
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,851
with sleeping pills in it to his son.

357
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,771
He could've taken the pills

358
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,733
after you left.

359
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,242
I thought that could be.

360
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,787
Because, on that day,

361
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,414
we talked about my mom.

362
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,294
I told him it was not suicide.

363
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,797
What did you do to my mom?

364
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,717
I asked him what he did to my mom.

365
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,769
I thought he did something

366
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,897
to make my mom commit suicide.

367
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,443
But I was wrong.

368
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,157
Father was preparing for a divorce.

369
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
I wanted to start again.

370
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,704
I was going to live

371
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,623
with you and your mom here.

372
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,209
He said that he wanted

373
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,005
to restart with me and my mom.

374
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,809
We're also investigating

375
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,478
your father's case.

376
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,357
There's something weird.

377
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,694
I also checked your mother's file today.

378
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,156
There were no pills left at the scene.

379
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,243
You still don't remember

380
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,203
who came to your house

381
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,085
on the day?

382
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
No.

383
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,802
Let's reinvestigate both cases.

384
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,762
We'll go check the villa.

385
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,847
You try

386
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,932
to restore your exact memory

387
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
of that day.

388
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,396
We don't have any evidence yet.

389
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,690
You...

390
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,318
must get your memory back.

391
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,157
And your letter of resignation

392
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,409
wasn't submitted yet.

393
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,745
Come back anytime you want.

394
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,123
We're a team, right?

395
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,427
Currently, Hansu

396
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,804
is facing the worst crisis.

397
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,266
A dead body was found
in the chairman's house,

398
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,893
and the chairman passed away.

399
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,729
Our stock price is plunging.

400
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,022
Unless we take actions,

401
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,316
our public image will be damaged severely.

402
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,694
Vice Chairman Jin should be Chairman
as soon as possible.

403
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,155
Right.
We have no other choices.

404
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,699
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

405
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,910
You assisted the previous chairman,

406
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,663
and you've been close
with Vice Chairman Jin as well.

407
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,457
Do you think Jin Seungju

408
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,584
deserves to be the chairman?

409
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,922
I'll have him make up for it.

410
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,008
I can't let that kind of person
be the chairman of Hansu.

411
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,010
I got a call.

412
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,972
He said

413
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,516
he wanted to revise his will.

414
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,894
He changed his mind for some reason,

415
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,939
but now I can't ask him
what it was.

416
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,700
"Detective Lee Ganghyun"

417
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,912
Excuse me for a second.

418
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,499
Mr. Choi. This is Lee Ganghyun.

419
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,750
Yes?

420
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,460
Did Chairman Jin Myeongchul

421
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,879
take sleeping pills often?

422
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,214
No.

423
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,217
He had no problem in sleeping.

424
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,928
Why?

425
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,389
I can't figure out

426
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,266
where he got sleeping pills.

427
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,811
As far as I know,

428
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,814
his wife has been taking it
for a long time.

429
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
Has she?

430
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,611
You think it's not suicide?

431
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,198
We're considering all the possibilities.

432
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,917
There's no security cam here.

433
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,045
Right.

434
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,131
No streetlight, either.
It'll be pitch-dark at night.

435
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,236
No security cams
inside the villa, right?

436
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,448
Yes. I heard the ones outside
were all out of order.

437
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,744
No one used that villa for a long time.

438
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,288
Someone who knows that

439
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,041
could easily sneak into the villa, right?

440
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,191
Long time no see.

441
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,655
I have a favor.

442
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,744
I need to restore my memory

443
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,664
of the day of my mom's death.

444
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,541
Why should I

445
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,000
do you a favor?

446
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,590
Because the footage
that you care about very much

447
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,884
is still in the evidence room,

448
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,222
and I might leak it by mistake.

449
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,699
Well...

450
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,368
Now,

451
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,330
let's walk

452
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,125
deeper into your memories.

453
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,331
"Jin Myeongchul's death case"

454
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,625
"Found dead
sitting on a chair in the villa"

455
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,098
It's possible
to sneak into the villa.

456
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,559
If someone sneaked in

457
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,853
after Jin left there,

458
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,605
and put a pill into the bottle...

459
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,733
That would've been the one
who knows about the villa well,

460
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,236
and who would not be suspected
by Chairman Jin.

461
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,571
Who's this woman?

462
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
She...

463
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,830
is Jin's real mother.

464
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,750
What?

465
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,338
25 years ago, she died
from a sleeping pill overdose.

466
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,801
There were no sleeping pills
left at the scene as well.

467
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,719
You mean,

468
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,513
both cases

469
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,932
could be homicide cases?

470
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,852
Wait.

471
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,063
Then--

472
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,898
We should think about the one

473
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,359
who would benefit the most.

474
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,154
Right.
If the benefit is the murder motive...

475
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,364
Chairman Jin

476
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,700
was preparing to divorce 25 years ago.

477
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,121
The one who'd benefit the most
from Kim Seonyoung's death

478
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,164
is Cho Heeja.

479
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,585
And from Jin Myeongchul's death,

480
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,629
Jin Seungju, the next chairman,

481
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,881
would benefit the most.

482
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,677
So, the culprits
could be his stepmother and stepbrother?

483
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,055
That's possible.

484
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,433
But it's not clear yet.

485
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,603
Let's not jump to the conclusion.

486
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,354
There's a strong possibility.

487
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,274
They had both the motive
and the way of murder.

488
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,039
I remember the one

489
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,004
who came on the day of my mom's death.

490
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,897
Mom!

491
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,713
It was Cho Heeja.

492
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,334
On that day,

493
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,463
Cho Heeja came to my house.

494
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,342
She assaulted my mom.

495
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,643
At that time,

496
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,146
Chairman Jin was preparing for a divorce.

497
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,399
And Ms. Cho found it out.

498
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,320
I wasn't aware that she went there.

499
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,365
I know who Han Daehoon is.

500
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,619
He's Seungju's biological father.

501
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,250
Did Father find it out then?

502
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
Was that why he decided to divorce?

503
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,674
Chairman Jin knew that
before he got married to Ms. Cho.

504
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,638
He thought of this marriage as a business.

505
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,349
He said, he couldn't love her,

506
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,559
so it might be better to choose

507
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,353
the woman who was already in love
with another man.

508
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,064
While preparing for the wedding,

509
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,693
he found out that she was pregnant.

510
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,696
Chairman accepted her

511
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,532
knowing everything in the first place.

512
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,869
Then,

513
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,121
why did he decide to divorce?

514
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,748
Because he found out

515
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,417
that he had a real son.

516
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,932
The one who ordered Han Daehoon's murder

517
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,892
was Cho Heeja.

518
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,563
And my mom

519
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,484
might also have been killed by her.

520
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,321
I need her whereabouts of that day.

521
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,405
I...

522
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,825
will look into it.

523
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,338
There are two possibilities.

524
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,006
Cho Heeja killed Kim Seonyoung

525
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,258
25 years ago,

526
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,426
and Jin Seungju, who found it out later,

527
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,845
covered the truth.

528
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,847
Like Han Daehoon's case?

529
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,223
Yes.

530
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,642
And Jin Seungju killed Jin Myeongchul

531
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,644
in the same way.

532
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,604
- Or--
- Cho Heeja

533
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,024
killed both Kim Seonyoung
and Jin Myeongchul.

534
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,609
Right.

535
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,612
The first murder was executed
as a perfect crime,

536
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,114
so she used the same way.

537
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,532
But

538
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,908
I still don't get it.

539
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,954
I understand she wanted to kill Kim,
but why did she kill the chairman?

540
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,789
Her son, Jin Seungju,

541
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,583
was supposed
to be the next chairman by default.

542
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,085
Maybe he was not
for some reason.

543
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,130
Let's focus
on Jin Myeongchul's case for now.

544
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,674
Jin will look into the case
that occurred 25 years ago.

545
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,884
Check the alibi

546
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,510
and the cams around the villa.

547
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,053
Okay.

548
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,557
- Hello.
- Yes.

549
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,142
Police.

550
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,476
Can we talk for a second?

551
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,896
What's up?

552
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,939
You work here, right?

553
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,149
Right.

554
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,693
On the day
of Chairman Jin's death,

555
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,069
did you work here?

556
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,488
Yes, I did.

557
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,824
Who was in the house that night?

558
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,369
Ms. Cho and Vice Chairman Jin
were in the house.

559
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,081
Other than those two,

560
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,751
didn't anyone else leave the house
in the early morning?

561
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,211
I don't know.

562
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,131
I finished my work at 11:00 p.m.
and went home.

563
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,634
All workers should leave before 11:00 p.m.

564
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,970
Ms. Cho doesn't like having an outsider
in her house when she's sleeping.

565
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,432
I see. Thank you for cooperation.

566
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,516
Okay.

567
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,901
Take them away.
I don't feel like eating.

568
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,031
"housekeeper1"

569
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,372
What?

570
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,958
A cop visited here.

571
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,585
Why?

572
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,170
He asked me

573
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,256
who left the house
on the day of the chairman's death.

574
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,658
A car left the house at 1:00 a.m.

575
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,035
I can tell the plate number,

576
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,745
but I can't identify the driver.

577
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,125
Both Jin Seungju and Cho Heeja
were in the house, right?

578
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,292
Yes.

579
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,298
Hello, Mr. Choi.

580
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,342
I have a favor to ask you.

581
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,142
Mr. Choi.

582
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,644
Sorry. I was distracted to something.

583
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,356
Don't call anyone.

584
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,817
I'll handle it.

585
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,945
I'll tell the vice chairman.

586
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,205
Yes.

587
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,916
Okay, handle it that way.

588
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,003
What's up?

589
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,340
There was a fender bender
at the parking lot.

590
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,758
So?

591
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,218
It's Mr. Choi

592
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,011
who caused the accident.

593
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,980
One component is missing.

594
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,107
Let me go check it.

595
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,191
Okay.

596
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,295
"No SD card detected"

597
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,396
-Yes.
-The SD card was already removed.

598
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,775
You think

599
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,277
Jin Seungju is the culprit?

600
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,156
It's clear that he is a suspect.

601
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,118
Do you have other evidence?

602
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,454
No. I don't have any physical evidence.

603
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,766
"Isoo"

604
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,028
Hey.

605
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,863
Seungju.

606
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,742
I need to talk to you.

607
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,869
Let's meet.

608
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,580
Okay.

609
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,373
I also have something to tell you.

610
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,228
Hey.

611
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
You want a drink?

612
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,985
Sure.

613
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,169
I'll be inaugurated

614
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,505
as Chairman soon.

615
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,262
So, come and work with me.

616
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,138
I can't do this alone.

617
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,934
You're my only brother.
You should help me.

618
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,937
I still have something to do.

619
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,939
We only have each other now.

620
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,026
Stop idling away.

621
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,616
Mom's death

622
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,829
was not suicide.

623
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,838
She might have been murdered.

624
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,011
What?

625
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,142
Whoever it is,

626
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,438
I'll get the culprit.

627
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,986
Now I remember.

628
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,366
On that day,

629
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,457
your mother came to my house.

630
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,212
She assaulted my mom.

631
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,471
That's why I'm telling it to you.

632
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,726
Whatever happens from now,

633
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,941
I have no other way

634
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,238
but to do it.

635
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,767
Mom.

636
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,647
On the day Isoo's mom died,

637
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,776
did you visit their house?

638
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,028
Did you

639
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,698
go to meet your father?

640
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,577
I saw you

641
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,539
leaving

642
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,499
in the early morning that day.

643
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,099
I couldn't sleep,

644
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,061
so I came out to take sleeping pills.

645
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,571
It's not you, right?

646
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,326
Did you...

647
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,746
do that?

648
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,503
Say no.

649
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,340
Please.

650
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,181
Mom.

651
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,309
You never cease

652
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,436
to make me suffer, do you?

653
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,859
This is what you wanted.

654
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,321
You told me

655
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,199
to own Hansu Group at any cost.

656
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,869
That's what you've taught me.

657
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,126
Living as your son

658
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,006
has been so painful.

659
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,094
Did you know that?

660
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,431
Honey, listen to me.

661
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,477
-That secretary did it to me first--
-I want nothing but this from you.

662
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,730
Behave yourself as Hansu Chairman's wife.

663
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,191
Why did you get married to me

664
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,151
if you can't even do that one thing?

665
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,002
Sweetie.

666
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,338
My sweetie.

667
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,589
Come on.

668
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,932
Don't worry.

669
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,142
You have nothing

670
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,688
that resembles that jerk.

671
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,107
You

672
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,567
are warm and kind.

673
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,199
You dressed up nicely.

674
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,160
You look like a rich son in this outfit.

675
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,748
But...

676
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,085
I don't like this button.

677
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,047
You, humble trash.

678
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,675
You think you're someone important?

679
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,678
Not at all.

680
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,763
I'm sorry, ma'am.

681
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,018
He can't go in these ruined clothes.

682
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,519
Sorry, ma'am.

683
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,940
Seungju, you're home.

684
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,817
How long have you been there?

685
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,361
You look nice, sweetie.

686
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,156
Today's guests

687
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,366
will have your back from now on.

688
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,454
Look up.

689
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,374
You are the one who will lead Hansu Group.

690
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,219
I've blamed you many times.

691
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,389
"What if I had been born to
different parents?"

692
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,557
I used to wonder.

693
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,810
"What if I grew up with normal parents"

694
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,021
"in a humble way?"

695
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,275
But I don't know how it would be.

696
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,446
People say
that living a normal and humble life

697
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,657
is a true happiness,

698
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,117
but I've never experienced that.

699
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,287
I am only sure about two things.

700
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,414
One, I have to protect my mom.

701
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,416
Two,

702
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,671
I have to be the leader

703
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,006
of Hansu Group.

704
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,054
That's why I did that.

705
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,391
As you wanted me to do.

706
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,853
You're the only one I have,

707
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,774
and I'm the only one you have.

708
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,111
Now, it's almost done.

709
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,622
From now on,

710
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,001
just remember this.

711
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,047
You don't know anything.

712
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,426
Just as you've done so far,

713
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,431
live your life
drinking alcohol.

714
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,559
Okay?

715
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,573
Father.

716
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,700
Why are you here?

717
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,077
Did you make a decision?

718
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,921
Father.

719
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,342
-It was all my fault.
-I can't let it

720
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,552
just slide like that.

721
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,849
-Then, what do you want me to do?
-Nothing.

722
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,437
I've already made a decision.

723
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,856
-You both turn yourselves in tomorrow.
-Father.

724
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,655
Are you going to kick us away like this?

725
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,323
It was my biggest mistake ever

726
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,243
that I let you two in my house.

727
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,170
"Chairman Jin Seungju"

728
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,131
"Hansu Group Jin Seungju,
Chairman's inaugural ceremony"

729
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,437
Special thanks to Choi Heejin

730
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,628
We have no clue

731
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,712
but only suspicion.

732
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,297
Is there no way to catch them?

733
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,965
I'm scared

734
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,550
if I made any mistake.

735
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,053
25 years ago, on October 10th,

736
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,722
he went out and had a car accident.

737
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,057
Where did he go?

738
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,352
Some fingerprints
found at the scene were ruled out.

739
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,979
-They were from unidentifiable children.
-Children?

740
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,648
"Why did my mom have to die?"

741
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,525
"Who is responsible for it?"

742
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,984
That's all I want to know.

743
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,736
Find out where Jin is now.

744
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,197
25 years ago, on that day,

745
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,323
did you meet my mom?

746
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,575
Did you kill her? Answer me!

747
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,037
Stay tuned for bonus clip

748
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,475
Isoo.

749
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,395
Have I ever...

750
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,232
lied to you?

751
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,110
I was also a child at that time.

752
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,404
I didn't know what happened.

753
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,239
25 years ago, on that day...

754
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,032
did you meet my mom?

755
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,786
No, I didn't.

756
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,956
She told me not to try
to find out a reason.

757
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,040
But it's hard.

758
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,333
I want to know...

759
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,003
Stop thinking about that.

760
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,046
You might hurt yourself.

761
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,309
If you have anything in your mind,

762
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,435
just tell me.

763
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,604
Isoo.

764
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,480
Forget about the past.

765
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,484
We have lots of things to do from now on.

766
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,655
We are the leaders
of Hansu Group.

767
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,620
You know
that I'm on your side, right?
