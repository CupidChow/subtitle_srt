CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,822
Damn it.

What are you doing?

8
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,257
No one can beat a group attack alone.

12

Stop, you punk.

13
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,238
Oh, shit.

14
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,157
Argh...

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,241
Go cover that.

16
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,576
Me?

17
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,579
Gosh...

18
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,497
Okay. It's me who got him.

19
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,541
Jeez...

20
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,750
Phew...

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,007


22
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,509
That bitch lured me first.

23
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,677


24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,888
Show some respect to the deceased.

25
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
That woman...

26
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,643
lured me first.

27
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,729
So?

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,399
It makes me so angry, shit...

29
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,483
A man and a woman

30
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,902
were on the yacht

31
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,154
<i>drinking champagne together at night.</i>

32
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,615
You know what the next step is.

33
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,909
Why look at me? I don't know what it is.

34
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,702
I was about to kiss her.

35
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,495
She pushed me out

36
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,747
tearing my hair off.

37
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,833
I'm also a victim.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
So?

39
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,338
So...

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,465
I got mad and strangled her,

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,966
and she collapsed.

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,635
So I just left her and came out.

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,803
But it wasn't strong enough to kill her!

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,305
You strangled her

45
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,224
and left her when she collapsed?

46
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,391
Damn it... Then,

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,435
should I have carried her on my back?

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,729
Gosh, you're an evil.

49
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,564
Guys like you are a disgrace

50
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,316
to all conglomerate families.

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,611
- Kyungjin.
- Yes.

52
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,279
Go get a drug test kit.

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,489
Okay.

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,074
Drug?

55
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,493
You found drug on the yacht?

56
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,162
You think that's mine? Gosh...

57
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,418
It's Taeyoung's.

58
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,337
He does drugs

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,546
secretly on the yacht.

60
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,715
After I left

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,509
Taeyoung must've come.

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,762
He really does it secretly at dawn!

63
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,889
Damn it.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,224
Go check it.

65
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,142
Shit.

66
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,519
What the hell...

67
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,820
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,282
Shit...

69
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
Where's he?

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,293
He's coming.

71
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,585
I knew it.

72
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,837
I was right, wasn't I?

73
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,674
- Taesung, you okay?
- Bro.

74
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,217
Oh, my bro!

75
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,261
He's here. Cheon Taeyoung.

76
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
- The CEO of DN Studio.
- You okay?

77
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,685
"Cheon Taeyoung, junkie
DN Group's second son"

78
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,020
- It's you, isn't it?
- What?

79
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
You did something wrong.

80
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,981
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,734
Run a drug test on this punk!

82
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,402
No, wait.

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,779
This jerk has it now.

84
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,239
I know

85
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,074
it's hidden in his secret pocket.

86
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,743
- You, asshole.
- Take it out.

87
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,036
You have one.

88
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,537
- It's here...
- Taesung!

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,997
Stop it, crazy punk.

90
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
Look!

91
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,958
I was right.

92
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,003
Shit, because of you, I was...

93
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,338
You punk!

94
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,132
Just let them.

95
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,842
- Back off.
- Shit.

96
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,677
- Stand up.
- Back off.

97
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,928
- Back off.
- You punk.

98
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,430
- I told you to stop.
- Get up!

99
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,223
You hit me? You did?

100
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,143
- What the fuck.
- Shame on you.

104
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,409
Great job, guys.

105
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,745
You both are fired from now on.

106
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,915

107
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,583
You're nothing.

108
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,834
I'm your elder, punk.

109
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,919
You're our elder?

110
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,589
Are we even brothers?

111
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,926
Forget it.

112
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,803
No breath to waste on a junkie.

113
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,098
- You're screwed.
- What the fuck.

114
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,141
Hey, get out of the way.

115
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,603
- Hey!
- Stop.

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,522
Who is the bitch that took my son?

117
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,566

That punk did. Jin Isoo.

127
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,422
And that bitch.

128
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,549

It's you?

130
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,635
Jeez, back off.

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,346
Is he out of his mind?

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
Call your boss.

133
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,558
Where the hell is your boss?

134
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,523
Huh?

135
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,192
She's a cleaner.

136
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,027
Oh.

137
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,863

See? Humble origins are hard to conceal.

147
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,398
You made all this up, right?

148
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,233

It's for private use.

169

Take care.

191
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,429
As we looked into it,

192
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:42,266
it appears that one of your sons
have murdered Jung Ina.

193
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,977
If you know anything about this case,

194
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,479
you can tell us now.

195
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,069
What did you mean earlier?

196
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,988
<i>You made all these up, right?</i>

197
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,574
I'll make you dismissed.

198
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,785
How dare you offend my family?

199
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,329
Is it such a great family?

200
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,623
What's your name?

201
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,251
I'm Lee Ganghyun.

202
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,423
I'm not offending your family,

203
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,302
but investigating
in accordance with due process.

204
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,138
If you want to talk about the case,

205
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,474
you can call me

206
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,975
anytime.

207
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,454
Get some water.

208
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
Okay.

209
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,263
Take it easy.

210
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,519
I went there for drug.

211
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,273
<i>I had</i>
<i>no other place to do that.</i>

212
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,225
<i>Then,</i>

213
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,644
<i>a woman suddenly appeared.</i>

214
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,149
<i>She looked like an evil.</i>

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>I was so scared</i>

216
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,528
<i>that I pushed her out.</i>

217
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,700
That's all.

218
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,952
How smart.

219
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,455
You got caught for drug,

220
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,999
so you plan to claim mental weakness?

221
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,419
Then, why don't you tell us all?

222
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,963
That's all I remember.

223
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,256
Jung Ina

224
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,550
was not drowned to death.

225
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,010
Someone caused her death

226
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,887
by hitting her on the head.

227
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,558
We think that was you.

228
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
No.

229
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
It was not me.

230
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,816
You remember...

231
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,235
nothing, right?

232
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,029
Then...

233
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,699
How about this man?

234
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,993
It was a month ago.

235
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,371
You assaulted Yang Jinseok near your home.

236
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,376
<i>You said the same thing then.</i>

237
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,295
<i>You assaulted Yang Jinseok,</i>

238
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,797
<i>and after two hours,</i>

239
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,716
<i>you reported to the police</i>

240
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,094
<i>that a man was lying</i>
<i>in front of your house.</i>

241
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,346
That's your pattern.

242
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,809
<i>You turn violent after doing drugs</i>

243
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,311
<i>and remember nothing when you wake up.</i>

244
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>That's why you did drugs</i>
<i>with no one around</i>

245
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,149
<i>on the empty yacht.</i>

246
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,903
Let me describe

247
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
what happened.

248
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,159
<i>You threw her to the river</i>

249
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,831
<i>and she climbed back up.</i>

250
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,088
<i>You just left the yacht</i>

251
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,924
<i>after forgetting everything.</i>

252
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,685
"Cheon Bangho, chairman of DN Group"

253
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Why?

254
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,857
It's weird.

255
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,902
This is not the way
a conglomerate family works.

256
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,738
It makes sense
that when we got Cheon Taesung,

257
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,990
Cheon Taeyoung
and Lee Sumin appeared.

258
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,951
But why did Cheon Taejun
and Choi Hyeonju come here?

259
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,245
There's something we don't know.

260
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,166
How did it go?

261
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,460
He remembers nothing
due to drugs.

262
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,171
But it's clear that he's the culprit.

263
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,267
Hey.

264
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,852
I'll tell no one.

265
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,646
You can tell me everything.

266
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,565
Was it really you?

267
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,118
Hit from the back!

268
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,083
Or...

269
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,877
after Jung Ina was drowned into the river,

270
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,754
<i>Cheon Taeyoung jumped in</i>

271
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
<i>with a weapon?</i>

272
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,345
No, that looks weird, too.

273
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,514
It's hard to hit strongly in the water.

274
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,391
Hey, there.

275
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,976
Let's share what's going on.

276
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,313
Taeyoung seems
to be the culprit

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
but we don't know where he killed her.

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,443
There was no spatter stain on the yacht.

279
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,736
What's spatter stain?

280
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,949
He doesn't even know what it is.

281
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,035
I don't know. It's not to be shameful.

282
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
Pretending to know is a shame.

283
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,414
I told you to watch your tone.

284
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,709
It's bloodstains
from a wound.

285
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,669
That's not such a big thing.

286
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,715
He druggily murdered her

287
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,467
and left her body there,

288
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,886
but cleaned out all the bloodstains?

289
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,389
Doesn't make sense.

290
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,102
So, the problem is where she was killed.

291
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,562
Right?

292
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,896
She was strangled

293
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,275
and drown into the river...

294
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,823
There was another boat.

295
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,035
It's another boat! Another boat!

296
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,202
Yes, it's another boat!

297
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,287
That's it!

298
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,580
She was killed there.

299
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,415
I saw a scratch mark on the yacht.

300
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,958
Wow, I'm a genius!

301
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,252
It's another boat! That's it! Yes!

302
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,379
Enough of playing a detective.

303
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,882
I left the scene by my boat.

304
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,091
Yes, it annoyed me.

305
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,760
I saw it when I was coming back.

306
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,893
On such a large yacht,

307
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,187
that kind of scratch mark hardly occurs.

308
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,481
He killed her on another boat

309
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,608
and to move the dead body,

310
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,777
he drove the boat too close to his yacht.

311
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,113
Wait.

312
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,365
That's impossible.

313
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,243
If there was

314
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,287
another boat--

315
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,373
So, you mean
someone on the boat

316
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,876
passing by at 1:00 a.m.
saved her and killed her?

317
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,628
Not sure if it was a coincidence.

318
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,089
But it's clear
that someone saved her.

319
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,175
There were bruises on her arms.

320
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,678
They occurred
when she was picked up onto the yacht.

321
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,933
We can go check it.

322
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
Where are you going?

323
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,020
You know how to collect evidence?

324
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,105
Go with me.

325
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,856
You're asking?

326
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,191
I'm ordering.

327
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,277
Hey, Star-Lord, let's go.

328
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,487
Yes.

329
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,239
See you.

330
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,703
Gosh...

331
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,456
Okay, just in case,

332
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,584
let's connect an emergency stop switch.

333
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,423
Pull it slowly. Good.

334
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,009
It's awesome!

335
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,594
You're so good.

336
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,263
We're not here to play.

337
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,265
Jeez...

338
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,850
Don't care about her.

339
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,977
Pull it. Good.

340
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,187
That's it. Very good.

341
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,189
Turn inward, softly. That's it.

342
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
Look at there.

343
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,526
Over there, you see?

344
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,528
- Gosh...
- Stop.

345
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,572
I got it right.

346
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,074
You see?

347
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
I was right.

348
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,495
Too close.

349
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,580
Pull it back.

350
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,042
Jeez.

351
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,212
Stop that, punk.

352
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,463
I didn't do anything.

353
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,181
"Jung Ina
Headed out to meet someone at night."

354
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,348
As Jin said,

355
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,683
there was a scratch mark.

356
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,101
It occurred recently.

357
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,397
Apply for a warrant.

358
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,108
Let's check all the boats
registered at the quay.

359
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
Okay.

360
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,614
You think there was another boat?

361
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,698
We'll see.

362
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,284
We don't even know
where the murder site is.

363
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,589
"Cheon Taeyoung"

364
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,507
"Cheon Taesung"

365
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,903
You don't even say hello to me.

366
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,531
We're not close enough to.

367
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,954
Jeez...

368
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,998
Barging into another person's house
with shoes on

369
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,416
is what only gangsters do.

370
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,128
Another person's house?

371
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,672
It's my house.

372
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,676
Apparently, your father
has given you up.

373
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,302
After the election,

374
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,346
you'll be sent to an overseas branch.

375
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,432
Congratulations.

376
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,184
Your dream finally came true.

377
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
I decided

378
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,896
to rent this house to my friend.

379
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,773
Clean up before moving out.

380
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,566
So you figured

381
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,988
that you don't have to pretend
to be a good stepmom anymore?

382
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,912
You've fooled Seungju so far,

383
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,790
but you can't do that to me.

384
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,253
You can never hide from me
how your humble background

385
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,423
has ruined like you hell.

386
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,724
Plastic surgery again?

387
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,561
You need mental treatment
rather than plastic surgery.

388
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,439
Paranoia and sense of inferiority
are mental disorders.

389
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,733
I'm so worried.

390
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,397
How messy.

391
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,066
Clean up and move out.

392
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,298
Do you know anyone in DN Group?

393
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,051
Is there anything on your mind?

394
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,886
I think...

395
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,889
this is not a simple murder case.

396
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,319
Isoo isn't coming yet.

397
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,867
He finally got bored.

398
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,953
Or he's not confident.

399
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,248
Gosh, Lee Giseok, this punk.

400
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,045
<i>A model with an eye on a rich son</i>

401
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>found dead</i>

402
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>What she wanted was</i>

403
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,259
<i>to be a daughter-in-law of a tycoon?</i>

404
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,762
Forensic results for her phone came out.

405
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,186
"Callers
Cheon Taesung, STM CEO..."

406
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,775
"Come inside.
I'm here."

407
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,901
"Cheon Taejun"

408
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,528
Jung Ina met Cheon Taejun.

409
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,779
Right.

410
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,323
Why did she meet both of them?

411
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,958
"Process for Mom's funeral"

412
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,589
"What to prepare for Mom's funeral"

413
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,716
"Preparing for Mom's last moment"

414
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,093
Let's go see Cheon Taejun.

415
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,263
You go investigate Jung Ina's mother.

416
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,724
She died ten days
after her mother's death.

417
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,392
There might be some connection.

418
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,561
- Check this address.
- Okay.

419
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,063
<i>Yes, I met her.</i>

420
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,650
I was going to tell you yesterday,
but I couldn't.

421
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,571
You know, there was a fuss.

422
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,158
Why did you meet her?

423
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,247
When a pretty model

424
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,917
wants to have a meal with me,
I have no reason

425
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,418
to reject her.

426
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,922
But I didn't have a meal with her.

427
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,715
Something important came up,

428
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,425
so I had to leave.

429
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,760
Okay.

430
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,471
What did you talk about?

431
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,557
Nothing special.

432
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,601
What did we talk?

433
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,273
I don't even remember it.

434
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,025
Then...

435
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,945
Where were you at 1:00 a.m.
on September 6th?

436
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,863
Let me check it.

437
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,574
On the 6th.

438
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,077
Oh, right. I was here.

439
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,039
You can check the security camera
in my company.

440
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,418
Do you own a yacht

441
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,337
or something?

442
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,172
Yes, I have one.

443
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,425
I haven't had time
for that recently, though.

444
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,803
By the way,

445
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,888
she was weird.

446
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,473
I heard

447
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,768
she also visited the chairman's room.

448
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,901
Who said

449
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,152
she visited here?

450
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,738
The vice chairman,
Cheon Taejun, said that.

451
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,577
That's right.

452
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,911
I met her.

453
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,293
<i>Excuse me...</i>

454
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,712
<i>I'd like to see the chairman.</i>

455
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,797
<i>Why was she here?</i>

456
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,591
<i>It's obvious.</i>

457
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,261
<i>She had an eye on a rich man</i>
<i>to change her life.</i>

458
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,972
That kind of girls still exist.

459
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,145
Where's the chairman?

460
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,355
He's away on business.

461
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,649
I'm taking charge of his job for now.

462
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,323
I'm sorry to interrupt.

463
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,575
You have a meeting, ma'am.

464
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,909
Excuse me.

465
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,620
I have a meeting.

466
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,683
Mr. Choi.

467
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,185
Found out anything?

468
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,730
It's obvious
there was a problem between DN brothers.

469
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,066
I heard a rumor...

470
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,578
They were sitting over there.

471
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,389
<i>You look prettier in person.</i>

472
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,016
<i>Did the shooting go well?</i>

473
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,397
<i>- In fact--</i>
<i>- Thanks to you, the image of our company</i>

474
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,065
<i>will become sexy.</i>

475
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,403
- <i>I have something to tell you--</i>
- <i>Hold it</i>

476
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,529
<i>for now.</i>

477
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,873
<i>Vice chairman suddenly left</i>

478
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,458
<i>and she followed him.</i>

479
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,170
<i>She came back, so I thought</i>
<i>she forgot something,</i>

480
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,089
<i>but she just left.</i>

481
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
Oh!

482
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,142
I like this spring.

483
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,144
This is exactly what I wanted.

484
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,895
Where did you get this?

485
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,898
Where did we get it?

486
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,697
But the view is not as good.

487
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,240
I like a big window.

488
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,409
Can you show me a better room?

489
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,870
The next room
looked better.

490
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,414
Oh, here.

491
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,916
That's already occupied.

492
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,549
You're not allowed to get in here.

493
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,176
Oh, I'm sorry.

494
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,223
Seems like someone huge is here.

495
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,477
- So, how about the reservation?
- I'll call you.

496
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,991
<i>You're not allowed to get in here.</i>

497
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,369
"Ahn Taekyung
Chairman secretary's office"

498
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,537
Bingo!

499
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:56,002
She approached these three
with intentions, obviously.

500
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,338
But why did she do that?

501
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,506
Whatever it is,

502
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,341
we should dig into Taeyoung and Taesung.

503
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,259
They were on the yacht at that time

504
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,428
and they are related directly with her.

505
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,264
There's something more.

506
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,893
Cheon Taejun and Choi Hyeonju,

507
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,144
those two

508
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,896
seem to be hiding something.

509
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,652
Found anything about Jung Ina's mother?

510
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,654
Her mother once worked at DN Media.

511
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,572
What?

512
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,158
"Chairman secretary's office in DN Media"

513
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,410
Her mother was a secretary
of Cheon Bangho?

514
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,541
And this is a list
of company addresses found in her memo.

515
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,253
Good afternoon.

516
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,215
You come when you want to come?

517
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,758
You were waiting for me?

518
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,555
I've found out something huge.

519
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,225
Guess why they were so sensitive

520
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,563
and made a scene
even at the police station.

521
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
Gosh.

522
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,150
It's a huge secret
which is hard to find out.

523
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,903
Cheon Bangho, the chairman,

524
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,738
is dying of cancer.

525
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,533
- Wow!
- They're hiding it

526
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,951
due to their stock price,

527
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,578
but it's true.

528
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,789
His sons have fought each other
for six months

529
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,458
for inheritance and the chairman position.

530
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,502
Yang Jinseok, Taeyoung's assault victim,

531
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,838
was Taejun's informant.

532
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,799
That's why he did drugs
secretly on the yacht.

533
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,052
They did bugging and everything
to find each other's weaknesses.

534
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,596
In that battle,

535
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,431
Jung Ina was involved.

536
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,642
Stop investigating without permission.

537
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,811
Mind your own business.

538
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,896
Jung Ina was...

539
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,859
an illegitimate of Cheon Bangho.

540
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,904
What?

541
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,740
They resemble each other.

542
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,659
Her mother gave birth to Jung

543
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,912
six months after she quit.

544
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,582
What Jung Ina wanted
was a sample for a paternity test.

545
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,004
Her mother may have told her
before she died.

546
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,595
<i>Your father is...</i>

547
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,475
<i>To carry out the test,</i>

548
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,935
she shot the CF of DN Media

549
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,519
and approached the brothers?

550
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,105
<i>She failed to secure Cheon Taejun's cup,</i>

551
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,857
<i>so she tried to take</i>

552
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,276
Cheon Taesung's hair in this bag.

553
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,157
She was trying to find her father,

554
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,036
but killed by her stepbrothers.

555
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,375
Cheon Taejun has a yacht,

556
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,626
but the problem is

557
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,252
that he has an alibi.

558
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,297
Someone else must have executed it.

559
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,591
To catch the culprit,

560
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,094
we should investigate his yacht.

561
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,485
- No more warrant.
- Why not?

562
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,112
After capturing DN's two sons,

563
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,447
you'll investigate the eldest son's yacht?

564
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,907
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,034
It's becoming a hot issue among reporters.

566
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,202
Whoever the culprit is

567
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,870
he was sent by Cheon Taejun.

568
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,873
He killed his stepsister
for the inheritance.

569
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,500
Come back with more evidence.

570
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
The murder site is his yacht.

571
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,753
Where else can we find it?

572
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,255
You should find out how.

573
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,923
Why?

574
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,216
You're not confident?

575
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,846
You need more evidence.

576
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,516
Gosh...

577
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,767
You scared me.

578
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,228
I'll find it.

579
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,897
I'll get in there and find it.

580
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,649
No way. Without a warrant,

581
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,569
even if you find it out,
we can't use it in court.

582
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,321
But we can't even go to the court
without the culprit.

583
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,033
We don't have much time.

584
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,493
He must be preparing to go abroad.

585
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,061
We're here.

586
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,355
It's luminol.

587
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,149
Bloodstain. Send me the picture.

588
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,233
Okay.

589
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,989
I'm not sure if this is right.

590
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,784


591
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,216
Okay.

592
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,941
Light, light.

593
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,359
Oh.

594
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,738
I'm here.

595
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,823
<i>You see anything?</i>

596
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,659
Nothing.

597
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,120
Spray the luminol.

598
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,704
Oh, luminol.

599
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,934
Jeez, they've already cleaned them up.

600
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,771
<i>Blood spatters further</i>
<i>than you think.</i>

601
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,606
Try it onto the ceiling.

602
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,900
Ceiling?

603
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,119
<i>How is it?</i>

604
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,666
It's amazing.

605
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,588
Okay, let's collect them.

606
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,971
I found a better one.

607
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,021
"share"

608
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,147
"Choi Kyungjin"

609
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,231
<i>Scan it.</i>

610
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
Hey, Jin.

611
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,493
The manager is approaching.

612
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,037
Damn it.

613
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,584
Jin Isoo! You hear me?

614
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,843
Mr. Jin.

615
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,512
That's not your yacht.

616
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,764
What?

617
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,265
No, it's mine.

618
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,350
Gosh...

619
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,310
- Come out.
Hey, sit with me.

620
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,354
I have a sad story.

621
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,064
Please, sir. Put it down here.

622
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,566
- My life always sucks!
- Jeez... Okay, okay.

623
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,361
- Okay. Come out first.
- It's no use to be rich, shit.

624
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,529
What is life?

625
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,114
Watch out, sir.

626
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll call a driver service for you.

627
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,284
No, it's okay.

628
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,577
My secretary is coming.

629
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,579
Make sure to call him.

630
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
Go ahead.

631
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,415
- You shouldn't drive.
- Okay.

632
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,967
Mission completed!

633
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,933
- Yes.
- Park Jongwook, 52 years old.

634
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,559
How did you get his fingerprint?

635
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,478
Where are you? What are you doing?

636
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,983
I don't know.

637
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,236
We need to find Park Jongwook.

638
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,821
He's the culprit.

639
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,825
This man...

640
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,035
was here with Choi Hyeonju.

641
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,037
<i>We saw him at the chairman's office.</i>

642
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,914
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

643
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,040
<i>Ma'am.</i>

644
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,250
<i>You have a meeting.</i>

645
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,672
Was it Choi Hyeonju

646
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,091
who ordered him to kill her?

647
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,803
<i>You want to meet the chairman?</i>

648
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,265
<i>I have something to ask him.</i>

649
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,349
<i>Just tell me.</i>

650
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,852
<i>I'll relay it to him.</i>

651
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,061
<i>No, I just...</i>

652
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>want to talk to him</i>

653
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,065
<i>myself.</i>

654
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,653
<i>A wave of anger</i>
<i>for an illegitimate.</i>

655
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
<i>It's a common story.</i>

656
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,034
<i>She might have already known</i>
<i>the existence of Jung Ina.</i>

657
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,750
<i>Park Jongwook,</i>
<i>who was watching Taeyoung,</i>

658
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,626
<i>spotted Jung Ina,</i>

659
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,131
<i>and Choi Hyeonju ordered him to kill her?</i>

660
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,094
<i>To keep the inheritance</i>

661
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,637
<i>and push Cheon Taeyoung away,</i>

662
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,306
it was the best way for her.

663
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,561
Park Jongwook is running away

664
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,645
with Choi Hyeonju.

665
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,148
They applied for departure.

666
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,949
They're moving

667
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,910
from Isu Junction to Olympic Highway!

668
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,244
They're heading to Gimpo.

669
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,372
They'd take a private plane.

670
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,374
Come to the Business Aviation Center!

671
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,730
What are you doing? Hurry up!

672
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,649
- Drive faster!
- Yes, ma'am.

673
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,369
The road is blocked.

674
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,753
Damn it.

675
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,806
Mr. Choi.

676
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,474
Please get my Coo Coo ready.

677
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,101
Right now.

678
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,694
"Gimpo Business Aviation Center"

679
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,623
It's ready.

680
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,833
Please get on.

681
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,922
Come on.

682
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,743
Hey.

683
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,952
You have a license?

684
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,496
Yes, I have confidence.

685
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,290
Put them on. I can't hear you.

686
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,753
- Do you have a license?
- A license?

687
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,838
- Where was it?
- Hey!

688
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,507
- Somewhere here.
- Hey, hold it.

689
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,674
Hold it.

690
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,177
Okay.

691
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,387
Let's go!

692
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,587
Where are you landing?

693
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,256
- Can you do it?
- Be quiet.

694
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,383
Okay, go.

695
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,325
Gosh...

696
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,179
"Business Aviation Center"

697
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:24,935
What?

698
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,395
What are you doing?

699
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,938
Hey!

700
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,398
Hey, hey!

701
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,901
Run!

702
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,737
Quickly!

703
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,901
Park Jongwook.

704
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,861
You're arrested for Jung Ina's murder.

705
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,945
Get off.

706
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,123
Get off.

707
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,710
I'll guide you to the place
you can't use your money and power.

708
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,350
Hey.

709
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,477
I'm the one who caught them.

710
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,521
Why?

711
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,855
Why?

712
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,942
We'd never have caught them
without my helicopter.

713
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,735
Who stopped them with a gun

714
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,320
and arrested them in the end?

715
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,530
That was me.

716
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,240
You're so cheap.

717
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,992
You wait outside.

718
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,661
You're so mean.

719
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,790
This way, bro.

720
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,257
Why did you kill her?

721
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,135
Because she was too greedy.

722
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,013
I'm the one who has grown DN Group.

723
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,100
Cheon Bangho, that jerk,

724
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,519
had an affair and caused trouble.

725
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,148
Her mother could quit
receiving a severance pay

726
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,774
thanks to me.

727
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,610
And Jung Ina appeared

728
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,488
at this critical moment,

729
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,701
so I had to kill her.

730
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,755
Cheon Taejun?

731
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,094
What's with her?

732
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,390
Your mother has just

733
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,059
confessed.

734
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,272
Why don't you

735
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,399
go wait in the meeting room?

736
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,817
Okay? Kyungjin.

737
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,985
Yes.

738
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,988
Please go in.

739
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,730
Where are you going?

740
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,691
Let's talk for a second.

741
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,943
What?

742
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,325
Make it quick. What's up?

743
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,786
Choi Hyeonju has confessed

744
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,788
that she killed Jung Ina.

745
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,709
You're shocked, right?

746
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,046
Oh, you already know

747
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,381
she's not the culprit?

748
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,258
What are you talking about?

749
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,134
I felt it was weird.

750
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,097
Every evidence showed
that the culprit was Park Jongwook.

751
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,765
So, it could be all over

752
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,642
if she killed him or sent him away.

753
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,769
But she ran away with him and got caught.

754
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,896
Then, she confessed right away.

755
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,565
You know,

756
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,943
she could call expensive lawyers
and escape from it,

757
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,236
but she's doing nothing.

758
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,365
She's trying to protect her son,
who's the real culprit.

759
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,449
Right?

760
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,289
So what?

761
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,459
I think you have
the critical evidence

762
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,712
that could be the game changer.

763
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,635
You bugged Cheon Taejun, right?

764
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,848
I heard you got caught
while bugging before.

765
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,767
You did it again, right?

766
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,356
Your plan is to threaten them with that,

767
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,068
but I think it'd be better for you
to make him a murderer.

768
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,323
You can also catch Choi Hyeonju
in this way.

769
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,373
You're in a battle of maternal affection.

770
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,920
Choi Hyeonju became a murderer
to protect her son,

771
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,881
and you could be arrested
for illegal wiretapping

772
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,132
for your son, right?

773
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,764
You mean,

774
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,683
Jung Ina was my stepsister?

775
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,560
Yes.

776
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,896
Your mother was already aware of it.

777
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,110
She ordered Park Jongwook

778
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,737
to watch Cheon Taeyoung

779
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,073
and find the evidence
of his drug addiction.

780
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,950
Then, Park Jongwook found

781
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,285
Jung Ina, who was drowned into the river.

782
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,579
That's...

783
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,665
so chaotic.

784
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,541
"Jin Isoo"

785
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,335
Excuse me.

786
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,840
Gosh, why isn't she answering?

787
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,803
How...

788
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,848
did it happen...

789
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,767
I just...

790
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,562
Gosh, this is so...

791
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,034
Then...

792
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,327
can I just...

793
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,246
get going?

794
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,543
We were going to let you have some time

795
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,169
with your mother.

796
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,629
No, not now.

797
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,549
I'm not ready for that.

798
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,633
I'll come back

799
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,260
later.

800
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,344
Wait.

801
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,224
You need
to fill out something as a process.

802
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,439
- Bring the statement.
- Yes.

803
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,174
It's the summary of your statements.

804
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,260
Just sign here.

805
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,439
Now, it's all done?

806
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,943
Okay. Let's wrap it up.

807
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,871
Thank you.

808
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:23,955
Yes.

809
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,043
<i>Hold Cheon Taejun there.</i>

810
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,003
<i>He's the culprit.</i>

811
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,922
Oh, wait.

812
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,723
Well...

813
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,898
Thank you for your time.

814
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,024
Take care.

815
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,109
Okay.

816
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,088
Why didn't you answer my call?

817
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,881
Why are you so late?

818
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,007
I'm not late.

819
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,676
- I came right on time.
- What did you find?

820
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,097
Cheon Taejun.

821
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,598
Please open it.

822
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,978
What's up?

823
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,729
Not the window. Open the door.

824
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,447
Why?

825
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,492
Here's a gift for you.

826
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,202
Listen.

827
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,875
<i>Kill the bitch</i>
<i>and leave her on Taeyoung's yacht.</i>

828
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,960
<i>We could remove this freaking bitch</i>

829
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,963
<i>and rule out this jerk in this way.</i>

830
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,757
<i>If you sacrifice yourself only once,</i>

831
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,594
<i>I could take up the whole company, Mom.</i>

832
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,766
Well done.

833
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,310
Jin Isoo, great job.

834
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,568
You're arrested for abetment

835
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,069
- to murder Jung Ina.
- No!

836
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,239
Unlock it!

837
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,490
How dare you touch me?

838
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,575
Remove it!

839
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,659
Get off of me!

840
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,412
- Sir, sir!
- What are you doing?

841
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,580
Cheon Taejun,

842
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,540
you're arrested for abetting a murder.

843
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,543
You can testify on behalf of yourself,
and remain silent...

844
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,214
What freaks.

845
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,301
I won the bet, right?

846
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,430
No?

847
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,557
Hey, don't you remember

848
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,643
- that we made a deal earlier?
- Okay.

849
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,894
Huh? Hey.

850
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,563
You sound insincere.

851
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,065
Here.

852
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,526
You won.

853
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,528
Win!

854
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,990
She's upset?

855
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,451
Jeez, she is.

856
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,221
Damn, I could've sent him away this time!

857
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,266
He'll brag himself for it.

858
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,271
We lost because this case
was about a conglomerate family.

859
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,273
No room for him to participate again.

860
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,941
You really think so?

861
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,777
My work
is already harsh enough.

862
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,154
Now I should take care
of that silver spoon.

863
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,744
Isoo reserved a Korean beef course for us.

864
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,830
<i>Bring everyone here. It's on me.</i>

865
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,914
Let's go.

866
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,252
Kyungjin.

867
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,714
Did you not hear what I said now?

868
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,549
You follow anyone giving you food?

869
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,426
Here is much better than that place.

870
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,594
It's more delicious and generous!

871
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,014
You like this place, right?

872
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,309
That's true, but...

873
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,061
why do you try to divide our team?

874
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,273
Why don't we just get along
since we've come this far?

875
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,109
You both are drunk.

876
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,360
Let's go home.

877
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,945
To be honest,

878
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,783
we wouldn't have caught Choen Taejun
without his help, right?

879
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,285
You think

880
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,912
we couldn't catch Cheon Taejun

881
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,622
without Jin Isoo?

882
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,876
Stake out,
find the proofs and witnesses,

883
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,170
and ask Interpol for aid
if he runs abroad...

884
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,047
I would have caught him at any cost.

885
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,423
Don't you think so?

886
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,592
Hey!

887
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,639
<i>We can't go.</i>

888
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,724
<i>T.T</i>

889
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,404
- Hello.
- Mr. Choi.

890
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:07,947
Where are you?

891
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,699
<i>I'm reading nearby.</i>

892
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,993
Did the helicopter help?

893
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,328
Of course.

894
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,163
I arrested a culprit using that.

895
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,331
Great job.

896
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,499
Oh!

897
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,376
I'm moving out.

898
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,920
To where?

899
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,088
You know the place

900
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,173
which has no relation to Hansu.

901
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,549
My own house.

902
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,344
Okay.

903
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,429
I'll get it

904
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,806
prepared.

905
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,641
Thanks.

906
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,069
Oh?

907
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,113
Hey, bro.

908
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,785
Seungju.

909
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,787
Oh.

910
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,205
Hello.

911
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,541
You know

912
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,625
what I did today?

913
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,627
I heard the news.

914
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,171
'A rich son caught a culprit
using a helicopter.'

915
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,424
You asked me
why I need a license for that?

916
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,217
That was for today.

917
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,438
Seungju.

918
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,484
How large is the asset size of DN Media?

919
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,778
Well, maybe...

920
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,197
over five trillion?

921
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,574
Five trillion...

922
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,830
Did they have to keep that money
even by committing a murder?

923
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,166
If it were Hansu Group,

924
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,543
I might not have been alive.

925
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,753
What are you talking about?

926
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,884
Bro...

927
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,263
When I first came to your house,

928
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,600
why were you so kind to me?

929
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,603
You must have hated me.

930
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,191
Well...

931
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,238
Right. I hated you.

932
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,744
<i>I told you to separate the table.</i>

933
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,163
<i>Gosh, he's getting on my nerves.</i>

934
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,707
<i>Get him out of my sight!</i>

935
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,752
<i>Why are you making me mad?</i>

936
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,170

937
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,839

938
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,009
<i>And when I saw you,</i>

939
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,428
<i>what can I say...</i>

940
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,973
<i>I felt a kind of pity.</i>

941
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,268
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

942
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,287
Thank you.

943
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,125
If it were not for you,

944
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,961
I would've been twisted.

945
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,047
Hey.

946
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,258
I'm thankful to you
that you grew up so well.

947
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,263
I can't say
I've never been twisted, but...

948
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,598
I'm grown well, right?

949
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,891
Yes.

950
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,476
You grew well.

It's my privilege.
