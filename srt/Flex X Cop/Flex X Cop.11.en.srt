00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,549
I'm Lee Seongwook,
the manager of the Oryun Community.

7
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,427
I'd like to meet you.

8
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,929
I...

9
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,683
will reveal everything.

10
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,856
Wait.

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,399
Please...

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,235
Hey, wait. I'll...

13
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,279
I'll call Bori now. Wait.

14
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,697
Hold on.

Yes.

A dead body
was found in the Han River.

18
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,157
I'll be there. I'm around.

Wait.

Chief.

26
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,017
Don't you feel hungry?

27
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,436
Come on in.

28
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,240
Why are you still working?

29
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,747
I just have something to think about.

30
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,833
What's that?

31
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,377
Hey.

32
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,504
Jeez.

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,797
Hey, Ms. Lee.

34

"Mass suicide in a motel"

00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,591
Mind your own business.

36
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,009
- Okay.
-  Sit down.

37
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,135
"Suicides"

38
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,220
It's getting soggy.

39
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,889
He's here.

40
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,557
Do you plead guilty?

41
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,439
Dad.

42
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,834
You found his ID card?

43
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,127
Oh.

44
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,461
Yes.

45
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,844
It's a drowning case, right?

46
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,055
Junyoung.

47
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,101
On the body, I saw...

48
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,313
a tattoo of the Oryun Community.

49
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,871
My son, Dongsu,

50
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
was originally a good boy.

51
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,209
He changed last year.

52
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,254
He had a hard time
seeking a job

53
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,257
and suddenly said
he'd join a meditation center.

54
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,884
That's not a meditation center.

55
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,555
It was kind of a false religion.

56
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,394
They lure students,
saying it's a meditation center,

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,438
and make them their members.

58
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,025
- It's called the Oryun Community.
- Shut up!

59
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,318
Dongsu isn't that silly.

60
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,820
Mom, I've been there
to see what it is.

61
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,655
To settle there, he even used our names

62
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,407
to borrow money from a loan shark.

63
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,417
"The deceased, Kim Seonyoung"

64
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,546
I'm sorry, Mom.

65
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,176
Now I know...

66
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,391
how tough your life had been.

67
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,438
I really want to figure out

68
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,278
why you had to leave me like that,

69
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,743
but I'll stop that now.

70
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,416
As my name that you gave me,

71
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,424
I'll be someone helpful in this world.

72
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,221
So, please keep watching me.

73
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:24,277
"The deceased, Kim Seonyoung"

74
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,781
My brother...

75
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,117
was drowned to death?

76
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,164
Why are you so surprised?

77
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,749
Because it's impossible.

78
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,751
He was a survival swimming instructor.

79
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,628
Unless he was drugged or something,

80
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,839
- he couldn't die like that.
-  Right.

81
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,258
He swam across the Han River four times.

82
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,886
Then,

83
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,597
would you agree with his autopsy?

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,890
No.

85
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,058
- Your brother told us not to do that.
- Mom.

86
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,022
We want the autopsy.

87
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,205
It's a suicide letter.

88
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
Mr. An.

89
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
Send it to be analyzed.

90
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,551
Yes, sir.

91
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,220
Wait.

92
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,183
"Missed calls, 010-0287-5974"

93
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,061
Okay.

94
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,687
Let's go.

95
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,448
"Lee Ganghyun"

96
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,623

97
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,749
Hello, sir.

98
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,378
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,683
You know Lee Seongwook, right?

100
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,396
Did you meet him recently?

101
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,317
- What's up?
- He killed himself.

102
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,194
What?

103
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,697
And the last person
he talked to was you.

104
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,865
Come on.

105
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,702
He committed suicide?

106
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
When?

107
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
Where and how did he die?

108
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm asking you.

109
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,085
Why is your number on his phone?

110
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,379
What the hell did you do?

111
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,764
What's going on?

112
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,768
What's up?

113
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,274
A dead body was found
at the construction site this morning,

114
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,445
and we found Lee's name on his call list.

115
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,657
Did you talk to Lee Seongwook?

116
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
For what?

117
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,831
What was your plan this time?

118
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,175
You already know

119
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,386
that it's Lee Seongwook.

120
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,557
How did you know that?

121
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,227
- I was reported--
- The Chief is here.

122
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,898
Who were you reported from?

123
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,942
That's none of your business.

124
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,694
What happened?

125
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,989
It seems to be a suicide case.

126
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,908
We found a suicide letter.

127
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,702
- Okay, then. Wrap it up--
- This is not suicide.

128
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,916
He wanted to reveal everything
about the Oryun Community.

129
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,376
That's why he called me.

130
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,461
We were going to meet up.

131
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,508
Who on earth were you reported from?

132
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,970
Shut up.

133
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,432
- Are you interrogating me?
- Just answer me.

134
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,643
- Who was that?
- Shut your mouth.

135
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,937
I'm your boss.
I'm the captain, you punk.

136
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,649
You always overreact

137
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,984
every time
the Oryun Community is mentioned.

138
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,445
You...

139
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,239
are under probation from today.

140
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,200
Stay out of my sight for a week.

141
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,663
Get lost, punk!

142
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,673
Sir.

143
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm just...

144
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,968
You saw she's out of her mind.

145
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,594
She could cause big trouble.

146
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
Don't share anything with her.

147
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,061
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,522
Ganghyun.

149
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,107
Yes.

150
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
Hey.

151
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
What's that face?

152
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,737
What's up?

153
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,946
No, it's nothing.

154
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,990
Hey, what's up?

155
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,450
Tell me.

156
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,912
Let's talk later.

157
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm busy now.

158
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,883
Mr. An.

159
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,511
This is not suicide.

160
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,806
Let me see the suicide letter.

161
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,141
No, I can't.

162
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,893
Captain told me not to.

163
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,270
You owe me something.

164
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,480
Damn it.

165
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,942
I'm begging you.

166
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,986
You...

167
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,906
are not allowed to see this. Okay?

168
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,159
You got it? Jeez.

169
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,997
"30-year-old man who fell to death
Investigation report"

170
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,796
Hey.

171
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,088
You guys, come here.

172
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,507
You have coins?

173
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,050
You have some.

174
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,469
-  They're for later. Come on.
-  You have coins.

175
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,888
I should use them later.
Just come here.

176
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,306
What's up?

177
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,938
Why are they always talking alone?

178
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,566
They're supposed to share
everything about the case with us.

179
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,902
I don't think so.

180
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,737
That seems too complicated.

181
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,948
I don't want to get involved.

182
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,786
You're so cool in some ways.

183
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,246
I prefer simple life.

184
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,959
Hey, Park.

185
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,878
You looked so serious.

186
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,380
What's up?

187
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,051
Ganghyun is under probation.

188
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
What?

189
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,638
- Why?
- You don't need to know--

190
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,723
Why don't we? We're a team.

191
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,477
It's about a private matter.

192
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,145
Never mind.

193
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,231
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,774
We need to talk.

195
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,911
"Copy of the suicide letter"

196
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,123
 It's been a humble life.

197
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,875
I lived frugally.

198
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,961
I'm sorry to my wife
who always cared about me.

199
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,256
I wanted to be a giver,

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,592
but no matter how frugally I lived...

201
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,926
"543 Seongan-ro"

202
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
Come in.

203
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,614
Salute!

204
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,908
Oh, Mr. Jin.

205
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,784
Have a seat, please.

206
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,869
Okay.

207
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,873
Okay.

208
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,003
How's your work?

209
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,339
I'm just killing my time.

210
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,965
Just wait a little.

211
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,426
You'll be in a better position
after the election.

212
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,094
Right.

213
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,805
I'm here to ask you something.

214
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,099
Sure. Ask me anything.

215
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,643
Well,

216
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,437
I heard Ms. Lee is under probation.

217
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,272
Oh, that.

218
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,358
I'm so curious about everything.

219
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,859
But no one tells me anything.

220
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
Oh, really?

221
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,487
- Maybe everyone hates me.
- No way.

222
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,322
That can't be.

223
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,782
Well,

224
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,993
as you may have seen so far,

225
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,162
Ms. Lee is a bit thoughtless.

226
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,164
Oh, yes. Right. She's thoughtless.

227
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,960
Her father, Lee Hyungjun,
accepted a bribe before.

228
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,463
The father and daughter
are humiliating the whole organization.

229
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,592
She loses her temper
whenever that case is mentioned,

230
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,886
so I told her to take a rest.

231
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,017
Oh, I see. She lost her temper.

232
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,019
You don't need to care about that.

233
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,562
And, by the way...

234
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,148
when the chairman becomes the mayor,

235
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,819
please put in a good word
with your father for us.

236
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,780
Yes.

237
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,699
Of course, I will.

238
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,117
I'll talk to him for you.

239
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
- Thank you so much.
-  Okay.

240
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,872
Bambara bam bam!

241
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,625
Bambara bambam bbam bbam!

242
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,047
Dun dun dun!

243
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,147
"Samseonjang Motel"

244
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,308
I heard the news.

245
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,353
I don't know why he did it--

246
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,480
It's not suicide.

247
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,567
 This morning,

248
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,152
he was going to meet me up.

249
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,698
He said he would reveal everything.

250
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,745
Didn't he leave anything to you

251
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,122
just in case?

252
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,460
No, nothing.

253
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,885
I'm sorry to ask you this all of a sudden,

254
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,098
- but you need to agree--
- No, I don't want the autopsy.

255
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,603
It could be a murder case.

256
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,605
You're Lee Hyungjun's daughter, right?

257
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,485
You kept calling my husband to bother him.

258
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,825
Why should I trust you?

259
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,855
I'm home.

260
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,398
-  Oh.
-  Hey.

261
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,108
You're early today.

262
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,401
Yes.

263
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,777
There's not much work.

264
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,696
-  Really?
-  Have you eaten?

265
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,905
Sure.

266
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,699
You told me to eat on time.

267
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,825
Have some.

268
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,326
It's good.

269
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,913
From tomorrow,

270
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,457
I'm off.

271
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
You're off?

272
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,420
You are? I see.

273
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,546
You have any plan?

274
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,006
How about a movie with me?

275
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,757
Oh, I'm going on a trip.

276
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,593
To where?

277
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,805
I reserved a temple stay.

278
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,015
Let me join you.

279
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,977
It's a meditation program
staying in a temple,

280
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,520
which is no fun at all.

281
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,399
Why don't you spend some time with me?

282
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,567
You can play with me.

283
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,445
Sorry. Maybe we can go together next time.

284
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,113
Okay.

285
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,506
"Lee Hyungjun"

286
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,641
"Mass suicide in a motel
Investigation report"

287
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,353
"Case report"

288
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,190
This case occurred
on October 26th, 2022

289
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,816
at 2:22 p.m.

290
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,360
In a motel in Gangha 2-dong,

291
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,113
three young people took poison
and were found dead.

292
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,616
Tablets including potassium cyanide

293
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,951
were found at the site,

294
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,994
and a suicide letter was found.

295
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,454
The letter said,

296
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,498
"It was so painful that
I had no other choice"

297
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,209
and "No autopsy, please."

298
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,796
Wheel tattoos found on the victims' bodies

299
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,591
turned out to be the same
as the emblem of the GY Meditation Center.

300
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,178
Therefore, this case can not be concluded
as a suicide case,

301
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,639
and it is clear that their suicide

302
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,558
was induced by the Oryun Community.

303
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,909
"Mass suicide related
to the Oryun Community"

304
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,996
As I mentioned earlier,

305
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,248
this is a case

306
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,001
where three young people died
even before they were 30,

307
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,377
which is a tragedy.

308
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,004
Apparently,

309
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,047
it seems like a mass suicide,

310
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,716
but we suspect

311
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,136
there was a community or a force

312
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,555
that induced their suicide.

313
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,016
We applied for a search warrant

314
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,768
for the GY Meditation Center
and the Oryun Community.

315
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,186
We'll continue

316
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,730
an additional investigation.

317
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,025
What's up?

318
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,234
Lee Hyungjun,

319
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,987
you're arrested for bribe acceptance.

320
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,824
"Urgent Arrest of Superintendent Lee
for Bribery Charges"

321
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,875
Mr. Choi.

322
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,668
Do you happen to know

323
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,587
about the Oryun Community?

324
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,965
I've heard of it from young entrepreneurs

325
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,718
that it's a kind of meditation center.

326
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,053
Please look into it.

327
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,262
Okay.

328
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,474
"Urgent Arrest of Superintendent Lee
for Bribery Charges"

329
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,481
How...

330
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,232
is Isoo doing these days?

331
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,651
He went back to the house.

332
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,198
It'll take some time,

333
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,909
but he'll understand.

334
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,369
I thought it would be easy

335
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,163
to be a good father.

336
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,709
My father had always been strict
and scary to me.

337
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,004
I thought at least I could do
better than he did.

338
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,257
Now I'm such a mess.

339
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,094
You're handling all stuff instead of me.

340
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,971
You'll have a chance to talk to him.

341
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,765
Don't worry.

342
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,267
He's getting used to the police work,

343
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,062
and he got some good friends there.

344
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,197
Seeing you're here again,
you must have a lot on your mind.

345
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,493
Here.

346
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,052
Why are you not asking?

347
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,225
I realized that someone
just standing next to you

348
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,144
could be so comforting.

349
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,273
And I can tell what it is.

350
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,694
I heard from the captain

351
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,365
about why the thoughtless Lee
lost her temper last time.

352
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,746
So, what are you going to do?

353
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,749
I don't know.

354
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,669
If you're to fight,

355
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,504
I'll be on your side.

356
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,302
You don't even know what happened.

357
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,472
You trust your father,

358
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,557
and I

359
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,683
trust you.

360
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,153
Right.

361
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,822
I trust my dad.

362
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,785
Dad was digging into the Oryun Community,

363
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,497
and I bet they set the trap.

364
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,919
For the past year, I tried to persuade
the manager of the community.

365
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,921
And today,

366
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,382
he told me he would reveal everything.

367
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,677
But he died

368
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,347
all of a sudden.

369
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,396
Now, I don't know what to do.

370
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,488
I'll just leave and take a break.

371
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,034
I have a villa on the beach.

372
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,744
You want to stay there?

373
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,788
I have a place to go.

374
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,250
If you change your mind

375
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,170
to stay at a luxurious villa,
call me anytime.

376
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,475
Jin Isoo, you're so cool.

377
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,361
What? Why?

378
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,655
About Lee Seongwook's case,

379
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,824
let me look into it for a few more days.

380
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,789
You know, I was accused

381
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,125
for urgent closing last time.

382
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,381
Okay. Get it right this time.

383
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,009
Yes, sir. Salute!

384
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,200
You're taking it again.

385
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,161
You take one.

386
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,580
Take care of your health.

387
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,875
Is it that good? Should I try one?

388
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,085
How about an article?

389
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,337
Did you finish it?

390
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,755
What article?

391
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,590
About Jin Isoo's mother.

392
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,800
Next week,

393
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,428
there will be a debate
for mayor candidates.

394
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,597
We'll blow it by then.

395
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,183
I didn't write anything.

396
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,393
What?

397
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,228
I wasn't sure

398
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,232
if it's within
the citizen's right to know.

399
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,610
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

400
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,487
I'm not a man without fault.

401
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,238
I know I'm a trashy reporter,

402
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,492
but I don't want to be a real trash.

403
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,452
I can't cross that line.

404
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,536
You punk!

405
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,538
You'd better be careful, too.

406
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,499
I heard some rumors about Wang Jongtae.

407
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,167
If you stand on his side,

408
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,586
you'll get embarrassed someday.

409
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,837
Rumors?

410
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,297
What is it?

411
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,176
Hey.

412
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,427
Hey.

413
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,852
"Kim Jeongyeon"

414
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,355
Jeongyeon hasn't been here recently.

415
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,731
You didn't know?

416
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,943
She hasn't been here for weeks
working on an exclusive case.

417
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,362
Without my permission?

418
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,327
The phone is off,
and we'll connect you to voice mail

419
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,079
after the tone with extra cost.

420
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,130
You made gimbap?

421
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,090
Yes,

422
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,926
I prepared it for you
going on a trip in a long time.

423
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,303
Here.

424
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,225
- Is it good?
- Yes.

425
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,518
It's good.

426
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,186
Have it on your way.

427
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,438
Thank you, Mom.

428
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,232
Dad.

429
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,483
I'm leaving.

430
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,568
Okay.

431
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,363
Have a great time.

432
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,157
-  Okay.
-  Good.

433
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,450
Call me.

434
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,743
I will.

435
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,828
She'll do well.

436
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
- I'm off.
-  Okay.

437
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,414
Good trip.

438
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,723
Why?

439
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,893
It's just...

440
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
She's weird, isn't she?

441
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,021
What's weird?

442
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,940
Something's up with her?

443
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,652
She's been busy,
so she just needs some alone time.

444
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,488
Just turn a blind eye to it.

445
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,739
Let's have gimbap.

446
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,742
I'll serve you some.

447
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,343
"A 30-year-old man's drowning case
in the Han River"

448
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
"Moon Dongsu"

449
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,012
"GY Meditation Center manager"

450
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,891
"drowned to death in the Han River"

451
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,185
"No wound, evidence,
Oryun Community tattoo?"

452
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,899
- Hello, Dr.
- Yoon.

453
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,442
Yes.

454
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,860
Okay. I'll be right there.

455
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,531
Where are you going?

456
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,534
To hear the autopsy result
for yesterday's case.

457
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,619
Let me join you, then.

458
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,621
You don't need to come.

459
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,373
Jeez.

460
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,793
You're so dull for a detective.

461
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,670
You still don't get it?

462
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,964
I'm a master key in investigations.

463
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,048
Let's go.

464
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,275
-  You're here.
- Yes.

465
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
What was that?

466
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,616
Is he an unexpectedly popular man?

467
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,080
The autopsy is finished?

468
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,957
Yes, just now.

469
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,043
He was drowned to death, right?

470
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
Right.

471
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,548
But

472
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,010
he didn't die in the river.

473
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,637
If he died in the river,

474
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,056
there should be plankton in his stomach,

475
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,684
but we found nothing.

476
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,561
Then?

477
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,938
He was drowned somewhere else,

478
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,608
and his body was thrown to the river.

479
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,444
So, it's a homicide, right?

480
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,281
If he was forced to be drowned,

481
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,742
bruises on the body

482
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,745
or anesthetic ingredients in blood
must be found.

483
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,330
But there was nothing.

484
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,375
The victim was an instructor
of survival swimming.

485
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,590
I really don't know how he died.

486
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,554
That's an emblem

487
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,891
of the Oryun Community.

488
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,267
Where was that found?

489
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
Here.

490
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,567
How do you know that?

491
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,196
I found it out by myself.

492
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,782
Because you guys don't share

493
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,533
any information with me.

494
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,211
Let's share

495
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,380
what is going on from now on.

496
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,382
This is not the kind of case

497
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,967
that you could poke around.

498
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,095
The honor of Ganghyun's father
depends on this case.

499
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,766
And it's also for capturing a cult leader
who killed innocent young people.

500
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,769
I'll take advantage of everything I have

501
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,604
to solve this case,

502
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,524
whether you help me or not.

503
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,206
"Samseonjang Motel"

504
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,003
Police.

505
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,298
Where
are the security cams here?

506
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,676
In the parking lot
and at the entrance.

507
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,844
Can I check them?

508
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,887
No one died here.

509
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,305
Why do you guys bother me?

510
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,141
Guys?

511
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,977
A female detective came here
and took the footage.

512
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,941
Please let me check it, too.

513
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,658
Two people related to the Oryun Community
died on the same day.

514
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,704
 Lee Seongwook is a manager
and a key member of the community.

515
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,540
 Moon Dongsu is the manager
of the GY Meditation Center,

516
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,876
which recruits Oryun's new believers.

517
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,796
Something must be going on
in this community.

518
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,425
You're investigating Moon's case, right?

519
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,634
What's up?

520
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,221
There are texts
between Lee and Moon.

521
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,682
They're on Telgram,
so we're analyzing it now.

522
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,310
What's the cause of death

523
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,103
of Moon Dongsu?

524
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,689
It's drowning.

525
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,524
His body was found in the river,

526
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,276
but it seems
that he was killed somewhere else.

527
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,447
How did Lee Seongwook die?

528
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,995
You can tell him. He's also in Team 1.

529
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,750
He fell to death.

530
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,877
A suicide letter was in his pocket.

531
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,592
We also got the security cam footage

532
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,802
from the motel he stayed.

533
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,220
I'll open it.

534
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,304
Okay.

535
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,775
This car is owned
by the GY Meditation Center.

536
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,782
If these guys killed Lee Seongwook--

537
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,784
No security cam is in this site,

538
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,369
so we can't prove the murder.

539
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,038
And it's hard to identify them with it.

540
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,457
But this footage

541
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,962
seems to have been checked
by Ganghyun yesterday.

542
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,046
What?

543
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,465
Do you know

544
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,592
where Ganghyun is now?

545
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,055
It might be hard to reach her.
She's in a temple stay.

546
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,392
This is tricky.

547
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,519
You're forwarded
to voice mail...

548
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,062
What's up?

549
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,064
This letter looks weird.

550
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,109
What's weird about it?
We confirmed his handwriting.

551
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,319
This story doesn't make sense.

552
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,364
He's always a bit off the wall.

553
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,742
It's been a humble life.

554
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,286
I lived frugally.

555
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,537
I'm sorry to my wife

556
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,122
who always cared about me.

557
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,624
I wanted to be a giver,

558
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,376
but no matter how frugally I lived

559
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,129
and worked hard,
I couldn't be rich enough.

560
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,882
Now is the time to unload everything.

561
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,466
- Goddamn!
- Jeez.

562
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,177
My gosh.

563
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,428
I made it again!

564
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,763
I'm so...

565
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,140
Am I... really...

566
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,516
Am I a born genius?

567
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,185
What the hell is it this time?

568
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,978
Come take a look. Come on.

569
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,271
Look.

570
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,647
What?

571
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:44,410
"Autopsy, please."

572
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,290
Autopsy, please.

573
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,465
Great job.

574
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,514
Do you know

575
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,601
who these people are?

576
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,567
They could have killed your husband.

577
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,617
This is his suicide letter.

578
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,535
Please agree

579
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,663
with the autopsy.

580
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,914
You don't know well

581
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,000
about the Oryun Community.

582
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,171
The primary doctrine
of the Oryun Community

583
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,547
is never letting a knife

584
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,633
cut a human body.

585
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,886
I'm a member of this community.

586
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,973
I met him there.

587
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,810
You don't want to catch the culprit?

588
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,144
My husband

589
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,147
just got an answer.

590
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,326
"Oryun, the five most important virtues
in Confucianism"

591
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,708
"GY Meditation Center"

592
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,421
 Are you enduring
a tough time every day?

593
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,382
Do you have a grief you can't tell anyone?

594
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,259
We're here for you.

595
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,344
We'll bring peace to your mind.

596
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,180
I don't understand
what this community is for.

597
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,350
Mr. Choi.

598
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,518
Found out anything?

599
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,978
Yes.

600
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,188
A man called Bori in the Oryun Community

601
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,191
is popular among entrepreneurs these days.

602
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,444
Bo... what?

603
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,695
Bori?

604
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,864
It means, "I realized."

605
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,285
It sounds very superstitious.

606
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,829
To have a meal with Bori,

607
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,664
they should pay 100 million won.

608
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,749
100 million won?

609
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,418
Is he Warren Buffett or someone?

610
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,296
So, who on earth is Bori?

611
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,964
Little has been known about him.

612
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,258
He's covering himself thoroughly,

613
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,886
so no one knows his real name.

614
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,056
The Oryun community was founded
about 5 years ago.

615
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,434
But...

616
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,896
many members of the community
committed suicide.

617
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,108
Then, I need to find out why.

618
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,070
This case looks very dangerous.

619
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,781
I don't want you to get involved.

620
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,284
Then...

621
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,787
let me ask you a favor.

622
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,716
"Na Han Won"

623
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,024
So, is this the scene of exploitation?

624
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,319
Anyone needs a cop?

625
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,071
Police is here.

626
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,448
If you need a cop,

627
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,741
raise your hand.

628
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,202
"GY Meditation Center"

629
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,796
Get off, everyone.

630
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,928
Should we go?

631
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,062
Who is Bori?

632
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,940
Mr. Bori?

633
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,326
I'm the founder of this place.

634
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,872
You're so young and handsome
for a cult leader.

635
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,625
Are these people paid properly
for their labor?

636
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,835
All of us

637
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,421
are working to leave this mortal coil.

638
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,423
It's worth more than--

639
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,592
Nothing is worth more than money
in capitalism.

640
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,679
This is what we grew here.

641
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,681
Try it.

642
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,392
No, thanks.

643
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,060
What if you poisoned it?

644
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,530
"GY Meditation Center"

645
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,365
"Room 201
Lee Soeun"

646
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,286
Please go to your rooms
and come back after unpacking.

647
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,126
Please come in.

648
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,129
Okay.

649
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,978
Wait here, please.

650
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,980
I'll go get changed.

651
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,357
Sure. Take your time.

652
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,817
I have plenty of time.

653
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,178
You got a call, sir.

654
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,771
Jin Isoo is here.

655
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,733
Welcome to Na Han Won, everyone.

656
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,448
First of all,
we'll collect your cell phones

657
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,657
in this box.

658
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,619
During your stay here,

659
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,746
you'll learn

660
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,789
how to leave mortal coils

661
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,417
in this world.

662
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,143
Now, pour out all your thoughts
that harass you

663
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,437
onto this paper.

664
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,939
If you write them down sincerely,

665
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,400
Bori will give an answer to you.

666
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,695
Pass it, please.

667
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,826
I can't hold out anymore.

668
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,329
Please give me an answer.

669
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,540
Bori, please select me.

670
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,645
"Lee Soeun"

671
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,665
Smells good, right?

672
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,417
I only drink coffee.

673
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,133
Lee Seongwook was found dead.

674
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,677
I heard that.

675
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,470
That's...

676
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,848
too bad.

677
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,224
Why do so many people here

678
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,768
commit suicide?

679
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,567
Because they misunderstand me.

680
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,738
In this world, special people exist.

681
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,658
Some people read the flow
of the world economy.

682
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,661
Some create genius ideas,

683
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,997
and some people like me

684
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,666
realize the truth about life and death.

685
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,548
I was raised in an orphanage.

686
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,844
I always envied other people.

687
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,432
-  Mom.
-  Children with parents,

688
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,100
those raised at home,

689
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,227
-  I'm leaving.
-  Okay.

690
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,355
and lucky children
who don't need

691
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,984
other people's sympathy.

692
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,906
Everyone has to leave the orphanage at 18.

693
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,409
I headed to a construction site.

694
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,536
I worked sincerely at first,

695
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,998
but a resentment
started to build up in my mind.

696
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,709
"Why should I live like this?"

697
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,003
"I want to be rich."

698
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,882
"I'd be happy
only if I had a lot of money."

699
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,678
So I decided to work at a company
where anyone could be employed.

700
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,806
It was a pyramid selling job.

701
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,225
Yes.

702
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,018
It caused a foregone conclusion.

703
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,687
I fell into huge debt.

704
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,941
After being kicked out
from the rented room,

705
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,736
I thought about it for the first time.

706
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,613
"Should I just die?"

707
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,116
"How should I kill myself?"

708
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,869
I was thinking about it...

709
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,040
when I came to the huge realization.

710
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,238
Then, I finally realized

711
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,157
that I had already lived
five other lives before.

712
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,961
"Hanyang, A.D 1443 "

713
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,506
"Seongju, A.D 1866 "

714
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:10,804
"Gyeongseong, A.D 1932"

715
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,060
"Seoul, A.D 1967"

716
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,816
Everyone said I would die, but I survived.

717
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,028
I decided to live

718
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,405
to spread my huge realization.

719
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,325
I help hopeless people by telling them

720
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,702
there's next-born life.

721
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,204
But some people misunderstood that...

722
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,791
and committed suicide.

723
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,627
Gosh, I almost fell asleep.

724
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,881
At least, it's not like "I'm the God."

725
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,049
I'm glad about that.

726
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,717
But anyway,

727
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,969
it's just a well-made bullshit.

728
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,054
Mr. Jin Isoo.

729
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,349
You're living the second one now.

730
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,435
In the previous life--

731
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,519
Enough.

732
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,313
Stop talking about that.

733
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,315
You lost your mother when you were young.

734
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,488
She was a warm and kind woman,

735
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,284
but she committed suicide.

736
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,413
Don't you miss your mother?

737
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,959
She is living her next-born life now.

738
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,093
You might need some time to think.

739
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,514
How about staying here for a few days?

740
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,987
Wow.

741
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,738
Yeji, you eat so well.

742
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,532
It's good?

743
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,367
Yes.

744
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,202
In here,

745
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,122
I eat and sleep

746
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,540
better than usual.

747
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,875
You feel comfortable here.

748
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,210
Right.

749
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,131
Well...

750
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,633
I...

751
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,512
was guided here
by a manager called Moon Dongsu,

752
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,514
but I can't find him.

753
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,018
Oh, Mr. Moon.

754
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,520
Right. These days,

755
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,522
he's not been around.

756
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,232
He was called by Bori

757
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,026
and went to his private residence.

758
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,777
I haven't seen him since then.

759
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,529
His luggage is still in his room.

760
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,615
He might have some urgent business.

761
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,661
Well...

762
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,622
How can I

763
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,416
meet

764
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,752
Bori?

765
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,424
Oh.

766
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,342
It's your first time here, right?

767
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,763
Yeji is here for the third time,
but she still hasn't met him.

768
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,267
I see.

769
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,821
Write down
your long-cherished wish.

770
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,074
Your earnest wish

771
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,743
will reach the Heaven.

772
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,958
"Justice"

773
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,504
"Next-born life"

774
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,949
To wrap it up,

775
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,243
we give you a tea of peace.

776
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,247
You'll sleep tight tonight

777
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,582
with no agony.

778
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,368
How did you...

779
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,081
come here?

780
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,424
My father is missing

781
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,345
after borrowing money from loan sharks.

782
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,806
Mom

783
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,642
and I...

784
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,231
tried everything to pay it back,

785
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,361
but it only kept growing day by day.

786
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,700
I'd only been thinking
about dying while sleeping,

787
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,745
and I happened to know Bori.

788
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,374
If I could be born
in a rich family in my next life,

789
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,709
I'm willing to die anytime.

790
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,461
It's not scary to die,

791
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,046
it's scary to live,

792
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,631
isn't it?

793
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,761
They said I need to make an offering,

794
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,305
so I borrowed more money

795
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,849
but

796
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,312
I haven't got any answer
from Bori yet.

797
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,443
Maybe I need to pay

798
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,195
more money to get it.

799
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,585
Jin?

800
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,838
Why are you here?

801
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,799
And why are you here?

802
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,050
Get out.

803
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,260
Do you call this a temple stay?

804
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,178
What's that hair? Damn.

805
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,694
Stop joking.

806
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,821
Tell me why you're here.

807
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,781
To be saved and...

808
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,951
I wondered who Bori is.

809
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,081
You met him?

810
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,416
Sure.

811
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,211
I heard you need to level up to meet him.

812
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,880
I was born on a high level, you know?

813
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,173
Where are my slippers?

814
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,596
What did you talk about?

815
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
That was just...

816
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,682
a well-made bullshit.

817
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,267
That's not important now.

818
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,936
It's not the river
where Moon was not killed.

819
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,689
He was drowned first
and thrown to the river.

820
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,149
That's right.

821
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,151
I think this place

822
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,486
is the murder site.

823
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,464
What about Lee Seongwook?

824
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,759
It'll be closed as a suicide case.

825
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,012
May I ask why he was...

826
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,640
He was too greedy.

827
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,017
I warned him he could get hurt

828
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,143
by his greediness.

829
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,563
What did you do with Jin Isoo?

830
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,316
I threw him a stone.

831
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,361
You lost your mother
when you were young.

832
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,698
She committed suicide.

833
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,619
Don't you miss your mother?

834
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,831
You might need some time to think.

835
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,086
How about staying here for a few days?

836
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,845
Oh, should I?

837
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,431
An immature rich son

838
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,225
is not a big deal to you.

839
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,770
There's this one

840
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,689
who really bothers me.

841
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,775
Moon Dongsu

842
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,653
disappeared after coming here to see Bori.

843
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,200
He must've killed

844
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:45,993
somewhere inside here.

845
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,078
"Background check"

846
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,538
Lee Ganghyun.

847
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,165
She's Lee Hyungjun's daughter.

848
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,835
I ruled her out from this case,

849
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,170
but I don't know where she is.

850
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,518
Leave here right away.

851
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,728
You leave here first.

852
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,312
This place is very dangerous.

853
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,732
They don't go easy
on rich and powerful people.

854
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,359
You came to such a dangerous place alone?

855
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,111
You didn't even tell Junyoung, did you?

856
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,948
This is my job.

857
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,035
They could be in danger.

858
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,205
You...

859
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,666
You don't trust anyone.

860
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,547
Everyone's worried about you.
And I'm also your friend,

861
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:40,965
aren't I?

862
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,098
That's enough.

863
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,522
Take a picture of it
and send it to Junyoung.

864
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,024
They took my cell phone.

865
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,150
What?

866
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,527
They said
I should renounce the world first.

867
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,321
Why did you let them--

868
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,347
"The result of Isoo and Ganghyun's investigation
into the Oryun Community is?"

869
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,334
 Something's up in there, right?

870
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,460
Where's Ganghyun?

871
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,921
 Mr. Jin
sneaked into the community.

872
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,005
 Jin!

873
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,383
 Bori
will give poison at 9:00 a.m.

874
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,926
- We'll raid the scene.
- Okay.

875
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,345
 Woohyuk will run away
after the plastic surgery.

876
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,639
You remember the one
with penetrating injury?

877
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,765
 He was dead.

878
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,850
Get up!

879
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,560
How many people have you killed?

880
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,644
Those are all fake.

881
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,729
Who will get hurt
if you keep digging it?

882
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,398
Ms. Lee and Isoo are in danger.

883
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,732
- Changun!
-  We

884
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,817
will save Ganghyun.

885
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,111
-  I'll bring the support team. Go!
- Yes, sir.

886
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,487
You'll die here.

887
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,697
We're here. Hold out!

888
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,031
Wake up!

889
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,575
Wake up, Ganghyun!

890
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,870
Stay tuned for bonus clip

891
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,381
You're not allowed to be here.

892
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,968
Do you know where Ganghyun is?

893
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,682
I can't reach her.

894
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,726
Answer me.

895
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,315
I heard the news that Lee Seongwook died.

896
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,319
Something's going on
in the Oryun Community, right?

897
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,445
Right?

898
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,782
We don't share anything with--

899
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:12,867
Changun!

900
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,250
Ganghyun seems to be investigating alone now.

901
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,793
You get it?

902
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,216
Get out, please.

903
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,145
Please protect her.

904
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,607
I'm asking you.
