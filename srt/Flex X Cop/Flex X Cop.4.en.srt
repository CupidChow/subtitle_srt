00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,792
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,045
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,215
Is that real?

7
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,809
Is he dead?

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,270
Report to the police, quickly.

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,647
We should report it.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,233
Everyone, calm down.

11
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,528
I'm a police officer.

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,448
Who's in charge of here?

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,741
I...

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,328
am an assistant of professor Noh.

15
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,330
Block the gate.

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,750
The murderer is in here.

17
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,378
This...

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,422
is a locked-room murder.

19
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,280
Hello.

20
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,492
I'm off today.

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
What?

22
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,331
You're doing what?

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,791
Crime scene preservation.

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,709
Come here right now.

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh.

26
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,430
Come in, come in.

27
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,933
Can't you stay calm
just for one day?

28
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,560
It's a murder case.

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,645
Artist Noh Youngjae was dead.

30
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,230
Come quickly.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,648
Who is that?

32
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,441
You're lacking in common sense...

33
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,569
Gosh...

34
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,321
He's famous
for "Life and Death" series.

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,115
The theme of this time is "Death."

36
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,700
He was lying dead over there.

37
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,451
It looked like a performance art.

38
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,912
People look angry.

39
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,122
No way.

40
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,874
They are willing to cooperate.

41
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,459
It's over there.

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,289
<i>Paint?</i>

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,678
You found him?

44
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,806
I felt it.

45
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,684
The feeling
that every case is following me.

46
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,770
- Like a fate?
-  Kyungjin.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,022
Get the visitors' number and let them go.

48
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
Okay.

49
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,524
Why?

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,318
Why, why?

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,737
The criminal is among them.

52
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,656
He's been dead for over ten hours.

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,951
How do you know?

54
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,869
I can see it from purple spots.

55
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,038
 Rigor mortis has already set.

56
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,873
You think he'll understand it?

57
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,377
Yes, chief.

58
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,170
We confirmed the scene.

59
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,798
We'll take this case.

60
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,424
Purple spots?

61
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,718
Violent Crime Investigation Team 1.

62
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,512
Yes, it's La Mente Gallery.

63
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,180
Okay.

64
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,149
Sorry. Please cooperate.

65
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,256
Hey, hey.

66
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,674
Get some water.

67
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,552
He's shocked.

"Kwon Dojun
Noh Youngjae's assistant"

69
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,522
When did you last see

70
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,898
Professor Noh?

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,443
Last night.

72
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,987
It was around 9:00 p.m.

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,406
I left work before him.

74
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,451
Why did you leave before him?

75
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,703
Oh, that's...

76
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,621
On the night before an exhibition,

77
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,499
he usually works till late
to check the paintings.

78
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,794
<i>- I'll get going, sir.
- Okay.</i>

79
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,921
<i>After 9:00 p.m.,</i>

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,298
<i>where did you go?</i>

81
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,717
I went home and went to bed early.

82
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,968
Where do you live?

83
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,475
I live in Gangha-dong,

84
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,602
Dokdo Study Room.

85
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,229
Why? You're not preparing a test.

86
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
What time did you arrive here?

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,944
At around 8:00 a.m.

88
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,744
You got here two hours
before the gallery opened,

89
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,288
but didn't look around inside the hall?

90
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,416
Oh, that's...

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,460
As soon as I got here,

92
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,588
<i>I set up the catering
and called Mr. Noh.</i>

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,382
<i>But I couldn't reach him,</i>

94
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,674
<i>so I went to his house.</i>

95
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,178
<i>But he wasn't at home either.</i>

96
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,015
<i>On the way back to the gallery,
I had a fender bender.</i>

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>Oh, sorry...</i>

98
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,520
<i>So it was past 10:00 a.m. when I got here.</i>

99
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,355
And...

100
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,024
I never expected he had passed away.

101
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,193
Is there

102
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,904
anyone who could have a grudge
against Mr. Noh?

103
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
No.

104
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,825
He was a great artist and a great person.

105
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,369
So, he was popular among students.

106
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,914
Hey, hey.

107
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,165
We'd better stop.

108
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,418
You should go home and rest.

109
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,837
- You want to go to the hospital?
- No, I'm fine.

110
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
Okay.

111
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,340
Go get some rest.

112
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,092
We'll talk later at the station.

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,301
Go. Take care.

114
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,845
Gosh, you're sweating.

115
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,942
He's the criminal.

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,318
But you cared about him.

117
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,320
That was my plan.

118
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,072
Bad cop, and a good cop.

119
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,408
This is not a movie.

120
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,492
It was all the same.

121
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,827
Chasing,

122
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>fascinating actions,</i>

123
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,248
<i>and arresting the criminal in slow motion.</i>

124
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,044
Mr. Jin?

125
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,006
- Oh.
-  It's been a long time.

126
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,134
You know everyone in the world?

127
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,677
I told you, I'm a celebrity.

128
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,304
Ms. Lee,

129
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,972
you're still stylish, huh?

130
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,599
You're always so gentle.

131
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,601
"Lee Hwajung, gallery director"

132
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,439
Oh, this is my leader.

133
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,734
I'm Lee Ganghyun from Gangha station.

134
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,907
Can't believe this kind of incident
occured here.

135
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,034
Murder case in a gallery?

136
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,621
The exhibition will become famous, though.

137
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,498
I can't deny that.

138
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,708
Tickets are selling like hot cakes.

139
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,128
It's sad, though.

140
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,965
Mr. Noh was beginning
to acquire world-wide-fame.

141
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,676
Do you know anyone

142
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
who would want to kill him?

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,016
There might be a lot.

144
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,810
He was famous
for his bad temper.

145
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,979
But Mr. Kwon said
he was very nice and kind.

146
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,815
What else
could he say?

147
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,026
His life depended on the professor's hand.

148
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,446
He worked for Mr. Noh for ten years.
Now the professor is dead,

149
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,990
Kwon has no one to rely on now.

150
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
He looked shocked
at the professor's death.

151
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,164
Did you notice any change
in Mr. Noh recently?

152
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,832
Oh, right.

153
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,251
There was a small incident.

154
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,127
A week ago,

155
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,214
someone suddenly barged
into Mr. Noh's studio

156
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,591
- and spilled red paint on his drawing.
- Oh?

157
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,969
The red paint?

158
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,637
Why?

159
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,556
- That's...
- The red paint was spilled

160
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,848
on his dead body.

161
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,350
Gosh, that's terrible.

162
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,060
Do you know

163
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,436
who did that?

164
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,899
I don't know
because I was on a business trip.

165
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,945
But I heard Mr. Noh let the culprit go
without any punishment.

166
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,531
Though it was one of his major exhibits.

167
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
Kyungjin,

168
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,204
check Mr. Noh's reporting records.
And secure CCTV footage

169
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,539
for last night.

170
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,748
Oh.

171
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,458
You won't find CCTV footage.

172
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,460
We replaced the cams yesterday.

173
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
Oh, I see.

174
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,715
Check the cams on the road.

175
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,925
The gallery
underwent renovation yesterday.

176
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,218
Okay.

177
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,097
Buy his paintings now.

178
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,558
They'll double in price soon.

179
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,642
Oh, should I?

180
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,909
Don't you have wet wipes?

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
Wet wipes?

182
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,122
Oh, I spilled coffee there yesterday.

183
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,625
You didn't wipe it off?

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,792
I did.

185
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,586
Do you have a tissue, then?

186
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,004
Tissue?

187
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,798
Use this.

188
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,300
Jeez...

189
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
What's this?

190
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,767
What was that?

191
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,934
What's that?

192
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,811
Is it sundae?

193
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,189
- Sundae?
-  No.

194
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,357
Cherry tomatoes.

195
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,733
Watch out not to step on it.

196
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,443
What a mess!

197
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,403
Who keeps a car this dirty?

198
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,198
I'm too busy catching bastards
to clean my car.

199
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,993
- Look, we should've used my car.
- Don't.

200
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
Where are we going?

201
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,039
To do the most difficult thing

202
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,916
in the whole investigating process.

203
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,042
What's that?

204
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,002
Notifying a victim's death

205
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,587
to their family.

206
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,403
<i>Who's there?</i>

207
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,530
Police.

208
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,050
Gosh... my head aches.

209
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,763
Police?

210
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,515
"Joo Hwayoung
Noh Youngjae's wife"

211
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
Yes.

212
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,399
Have a seat.

213
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,279
I'm Lee Ganghyun

214
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,655
from Gangha Station.

215
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,574
I'm Jin Isoo.

216
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,659
What's up?

217
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,079
- Yesterday--
- Hey.

218
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,375
Well...

219
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,127
Don't be too surprised.

220
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,629
We regret to say

221
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,673
that your husband

222
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,009
has passed away last night.

223
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,344
We offer our condolences.

224
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,683
That jerk is dead?

225
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,897
His exhibition starts today, right?

226
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,941
How did he die?

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,073
He was murdered.

228
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,621
No wonder that jerk died like that.

229
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm glad I haven't got divorced yet.

230
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,084
Then...

231
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,629
you're gonna do an autopsy?

232
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,381
Yes.

233
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,966
So you don't need me for now.

234
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,676
I have a hangover,

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,844
so I need more sleep.

236
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,763
You just go.

237
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,644
After 9:00 p.m. last night,

238
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,145
where were you?

239
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,608
I didn't kill him.

240
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,153
I don't even have any feeling
left on him.

241
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,197
I gave up on him a long time ago.

242
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,824
Where were you?

243
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,662
I was with my boyfriend

244
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,081
till 2:00 a.m.

245
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,585
I'll give you his number. You can check.

246
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,560
This would not be easy...

247
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,728
Three suspects.

248
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,147
An assistant who worked for him for long.

249
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,399
<i>A wife showing no tears</i>

250
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>on her husband's death.</i>

251
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,611
<i>A director hoping for the success
of the exhibition.</i>

252
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,029
Oh, there's one more.

253
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,408
A mystery person
who attacked him with paint.

254
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,411
It's interesting.

255
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
This is so exciting.

256
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,165
You think... this is exciting?

257
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,500
Yes.

258
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,836
I haven't been focused like this
for so long.

259
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,254
- I see.
- Oh, Ganghyun.

260
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,589
I should get going now.

261
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,716
Where are you going?

262
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,218
I have some stuff to do at home.

263
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,386
What stuff?

264
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,221
- You want to know?
- No.

265
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,265
I can stay with you if you need me

266
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,808
- in investigation--
- Goodbye.

267
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,020
Hey, Jin.

268
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,521
Don't do anything alone.

269
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,023
If you find out anything,

270
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,316
report me first.

271
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,817
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,529
She's going overboard again.

273
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,924
Honey.

274
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,759
-  Honey.
-  Yes.

275
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,302
- Honey.
-  Why?

276
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,721
Someone is moving in over there.

277
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,640
-  Really?
-  Yes.

278
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,019
I'd finally see someone
living in that house.

279
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,025
Why aren't you preparing?

280
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,109
For what?

281
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,236
You said you're going with me.

282
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,113
Did I?

283
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,326
Come on. Let's go.

284
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,703
It's a gathering in a long time.

285
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,164
You go alone. I'll stay home.

286
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,961
He used to stay out all the time
when he was younger.

287
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,713
You are a Hara...

288
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,548
Haki...

289
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,716
Ha, hara...

290
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,176
What?

291
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,886
Harazuku... or something?

292
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,434
It's hikikomori.

293
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,936
Hikikomori.

294
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,605
What a know-it-all.

295
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815
Go ahead.

296
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,297
"Noh Youngjae's murder case
in La Mente Gallery"

297
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,632
"evidence found"

298
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,050
"champagne, victim's fingerprint, knife"

299
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,386
"red paint on the body,
stabbed in the stomach"

300
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,518
Hey. You checked
Joo Hwayoung's boyfriend?

301
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,562
They say they were in a bar last night,

302
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,565
but the room in question
isn't visible to the CCTV cameras.

303
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,609
Bae Jinkyu, 34 years old.

304
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,236
Seven convictions of fraud.

305
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,865
A famous artist, a wife having an affair,

306
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,283
and her fraud boyfriend.

307
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,659
It's obvious, right?

308
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,744
Right.

309
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,913
It's a little too obvious.

310
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,959
Checked on the paint attack case?

311
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,253
Yes, someone damaged his painting, but...

312
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
The culprit wasn't there
when police arrived,

313
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,799
and Mr. Noh just decided to let it slide.

314
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,426
Did you ask Mr. Kwon?

315
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,552
I can't reach him.

316
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,180
What about CCTV?

317
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,264
I got the file.

318
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,109
Wait.

319
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,028
- The culprit is--
- Female.

320
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,407
Ask the taxi company for cooperation,

321
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,452
and check Mr. Noh's life insurance,
Joo Hwayoung's asset,

322
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,079
and her capital flow history.

323
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,456
And Bae Jinkyu's financial state, too.

324
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,708
- Ask telecom company for cooperation.
- Okay.

325
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,793
Oh...

326
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,169
No, I mean...

327
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,712
No, what time is it?

328
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,547
Three thirty, this is, um...

329
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,882
she's waiting, oh...

330
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,093
But, nevertheless, I...

331
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,678
- What do I do?
-  Why are you

332
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,722
so nervous all of a sudden?

333
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,683
I'm off today,
so my girlfriend is waiting.

334
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,561
- You can go.
-  Thank you!

335
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,980
Honey!

336
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,234
Sorry, I'm late.

337
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah.

338
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,903
You could spoil that child.

339
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,279
Let them.

340
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,489
They're in love.

341
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,324
- Only a five-minute walk away,
- Yes.

342
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,076
there's a nice pork cutlet place.

343
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,661
Let's go, then.

344
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,371
They're like lovebirds.

345
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,840
Why?

346
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,678
I've never seen you dating someone.

347
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,640
I've never seen you do that either.

348
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,226
I have dated

349
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,270
from time to time.

350
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,647
It didn't last long, though.

351
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,525
Me too.

352
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,532
We, soloists, should just write
a letter of cooperation.

353
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,034
When does the autopsy begin?

354
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,411
Tomorrow morning.

355
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,996
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

356
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,206
I'll visit Mr. Kwon tomorrow.

357
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,586
Where's Jin Isoo?

358
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,963
I don't know.

359
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,381
He has some stuff at home.

360
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,759
I hope it will take long.

361
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,961
Knock, knock.

362
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,921
You moved here.

363
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,174
Ah, yes...

364
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,052
Please excuse me.

365
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,219
Oh, wait.

366
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,556
You've already tidied it up.

367
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,017
Let me go in for a second.

368
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,101
Oh...

369
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,439
I wondered
when a new neighbor would move in here.

370
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,984
Who are you?

371
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,278
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

372
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,113
I am

373
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,740
the village master of this town.

374
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
Go Misook.

375
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,159
Oh, the village master.

376
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,456
Does that position still exist?

377
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
Of course.

378
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,918
This town can't be run without me.

379
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,504
And contact this person

380
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,048
if you have anything to be repaired.

381
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,634
You'd never get ripped off
if you tell him I introduced you.

382
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,139
The second floor is also yours?

383
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,725
Yes, that's just...

384
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,229
You've already cleaned up here.

385
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,068
Gosh...

386
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,446
Someone drew a picture here.

387
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,573
You'll repaper the wall?

388
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,368
Or paint the wall?

389
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,496
I'll just keep this wall like this.

390
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,750
It's my drawing.

391
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,002
I used to live here before.

392
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,421
You did?

393
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,297
Oh...

394
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,382
I see.

395
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,927
This house has left unoccupied
since I moved here.

396
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,179
Yes.

397
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,098
I'm back.

398
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,520
Welcome back.

399
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,397
It's a nice town to live in.

400
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,858
If you need anything...

401
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,026
You see that house

402
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,486
with a blue roof over there?

403
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,946
You can visit anytime

404
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,489
before 10:00 p.m.

405
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,491
because I go to bed at 10:00 p.m.

406
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,702
Come and ask anything if you need.

407
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,745
Okay.

408
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,789
Gosh...

409
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,791
it must be tough tidying all these up.

410
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,251
See you again.

411
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,086
Yes.

412
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,328
<i>Mom...</i>

413
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,371
<i>The roof leaks here, too.</i>

414
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,168
<i>Maybe raindrops</i>

415
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,462
<i>want to come play in our house.</i>

416
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,759
<i>Welcome.</i>

417
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,425
You're home, sweetie?

418
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,304
I was depressed, so I'm drinking.

419
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,890
-  Want to join me?
- You kicked Isoo out?

420
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,061
- Did he snitch on me to you?
- I heard it at the villa.

421
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,938
I told you, stop harassing him.

422
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,232
Why?

423
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,526
Why should I stop it?

424
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,571
You know how much I suffered

425
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,072
because of that woman.

426
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,490
You know all of that!

427
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,368
You shouldn't do this to me.

428
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,705
You're the only one that I have.

429
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,249
How could you do that to me?

430
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,753
You're the only one I have.

431
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,050
<i>Your youngest son</i>

432
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,344
<i>moved out.</i>

433
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,848
<i>To where?</i>

434
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,142
<i>To Gangha-dong.</i>

435
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,686
<i>It's been owned by him</i>

436
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,104
<i>so far.</i>

437
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
<i>Isoo</i>

438
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,113
<i>went back to that house.</i>

439
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,868
<i>Is it possible for him</i>

440
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,328
<i>to restore his memory?</i>

441
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,081
<i>Don't let him live in that house.</i>

442
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,959
<i>He might</i>

443
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,003
<i>get back</i>

444
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,213
<i>his memory.</i>

445
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,807
This car looks familiar.

446
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,063
Huh?

447
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,815
Hey, why are you here?

448
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,024
And why are you here?

449
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,693
I've lived here for ten years.

450
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,820
It's been my home since I was born.

451
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,906
Huh?

452
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,116
Blue roof?

453
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,077
Your mom is the village master?

454
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,453
You already met my mom?

455
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,664
She is so warm and kind.

456
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,207
You don't resemble your mom.

457
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,981
Huh?

458
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,445
This guy is a bit sensitive.

459
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,238
My car is cool.

460
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,615
That cool guy is in coma

461
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,742
because of the owner.

462
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,369
This is how to take care
of a precious car.

463
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,037
Then, you know what happens?

464
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,836
It sounds this nice.

465
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,920
You feel it?

466
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,047
A heart-pounding and touching sound--

467
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,341
Lower the speed.
The speed limit is 37 here.

468
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,761
Where's your sense of romance?

469
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,985
You were here.

470
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,618
I couldn't reach you yesterday.

471
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,244
I went home

472
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,871
and slept right away.

473
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,748
I came here at dawn.

474
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,541
Have you eaten?

475
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,335
Your face is worn.

476
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,006
I heard it from the gallery director.

477
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,674
There was an incident

478
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,343
a week ago?

479
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,600
Oh, yes. A woman

480
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,101
- broke in suddenly--
- A woman?

481
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,728
Yes.

482
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,870
What's this?

483
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,085
The cam here recorded it all.

484
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,092
To choose the paintings
for the exhibition,

485
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,718
I recorded it all.

486
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,096
<i>This is good.</i>

487
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,807
<i>It's colorful,
while it has a theme of desperation.</i>

488
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,183
<i>Hm...</i>

489
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>Let's pick that one for the main.</i>

490
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,855
-  <i>Mr. Kwon.</i>
-  <i>Yes.</i>

491
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,189
<i>What do you think?</i>

492
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,858
<i>Don't ask him.</i>

493
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,609
<i>He's skillful</i>

494
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,986
<i>but not smart.</i>

495
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,238
<i>He still has a long way to go.</i>

496
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,200
<i>Just pass the list</i>

497
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,077
<i>to the people in charge.</i>

498
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,331
<i>May I help you?</i>

499
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,516
Huh?

500
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,560
<i>This shouldn't be revealed.</i>

501
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,937
<i>How dare you?</i>

502
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,023
<i>You, murderer!</i>

503
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,400
- <i>You, murderer!</i>
-  <i>Are you crazy?</i>

504
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,444
<i>Stop her, Kwon!</i>

505
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,528
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

506
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,657
That scarf...

507
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,618
You know who she is?

508
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,997
Yes, I do.

509
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,665
I know her.

510
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,218
You're early today.

511
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,346
I was on another autopsy.

512
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,687
Noh Youngjae, 61 years old.

513
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,190
Died due to organ damage
and excessive bleeding.

514
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,442
Died from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.

515
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,402
Blood alcohol level is 0.06%.

516
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,487
Three stab wounds.

517
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,697
Turn around.

518
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,619
Turn.

519
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,207
Here

520
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,667
and here.

521
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,044
And look at me.

522
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,965
This

523
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,467
was the deadly stab.

524
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,721
You understand?

525
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,517
So...

526
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,311
he was stabbed from the back first?

527
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,064
Yes, but the wounds
on the back are so light

528
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,525
that I doubt
the culprit intended to kill him.

529
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,611
Like hesitation wounds of suicides?

530
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,737
Yes...

531
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,447
<i>The criminal hesitated at first,</i>

532
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,282
<i>and</i>

533
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,120
when the victim turned around and reacted

534
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,915
they stabbed him deeply.

535
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,921
What kind of reaction?

536
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,173
Oh.

537
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,468
It was under his nails.

538
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,058
Like this...

539
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,019
he held something tightly.

540
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,316
This is all.

541
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,821
Can the criminal be a female?

542
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,074
Well...

543
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,202
Yes.

544
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,454
It's possible.

545
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,584
Police.

546
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,419
Oh Gyeongsun is here, right?

547
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,712
Yes.

548
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,672
She must be cleaning the sauna.

549
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,466
Can I go check her?

550
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,800
Okay.

551
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,974
This was how jjimjilbang looks like.

552
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,434
Is it your first time?

553
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,561
Because I have a sauna in my house.

554
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,522
I heard the eggs here are so yummy.

555
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,691
Eggs are just eggs.

556
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,109
Do you have 2,000 won?

557
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,570
I forgot to bring my wallet.

558
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,917
Ms. Oh Gyeongsun?

559
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,254
"Oh Gyeongsun
the paint attacker"

560
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,049
Noh Youngjae

561
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,259
was murdered.

562
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,518
I never believed it,

563
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,478
but God truly exists.

564
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,815
He was punished by the Heaven.

565
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,317
He killed my daughter.

566
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,207
These paintings...

567
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,625
They look the same, right?

568
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,254
He stole my daughter's painting.

569
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,883
<i>He was
Yeseon's academic adviser.</i>

570
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,554
<i>Pretending to help
with her graduation exhibition,</i>

571
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,389
<i>he plagiarized</i>

572
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>her painting.</i>

573
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,685
So what did you do?

574
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,645
I did everything I could.

575
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,189
<i>I accused him, sued him,</i>

576
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,108
- <i>and reported it.</i>
-  <i>He was</i>

577
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,402
- <i>plagiarizing my painting.</i>
-  <i>But...</i>

578
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,070
<i>no one believed</i>

579
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,446
what my daughter said.

580
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,366
He said he'd help her to study abroad

581
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,285
if we covered it.

582
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
<i>But later,</i>

583
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,705
<i>he accused my daughter</i>

584
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,873
"Complaint"

585
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,374
<i>of plagiarism.</i>

586
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,586
<i>Then, your daughter is...</i>

587
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,798
She died.

588
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,218
A year ago...

589
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,390
<i>Stop it, Yeseon.</i>

590
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,225
<i>Please stop it.</i>

591
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,476
<i>Stop!</i>

592
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,395
<i>I don't need to keep these.</i>

593
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,646
<i>I'll remove them all.</i>

594
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,274
<i>It's no use keeping them here!</i>

595
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,155
<i>I buried her...</i>

596
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,782
<i>and I've been a total mess.</i>

597
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,121
<i>And then I saw that.</i>

598
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,707
<i>I lost control of myself.</i>

599
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,841
Two days ago,

600
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,468
at 10 p.m.

601
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,346
Where were you?

602
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,183
I was working at the sauna.

603
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,810
I worked till 12:00 a.m.

604
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,272
Okay, thank you.

605
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,107
I'll call you again.

606
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,576
That scarf...

607
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,955
It was

608
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,624
a birthday present from my daughter.

609
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,128
She had saved money
to buy it doing a part-time job.

610
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,881
It's pretty, isn't it?

611
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,934
I can relate to her,

612
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,437
but I hope she didn't kill him.

613
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,575
"Gallery CCTV
arrived and left in a taxi"

614
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,994
"woman in footage: orange scarf"

615
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,328
"Oh Gyeongsun's scarf"

616
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,542
"Oh Gyeongsun, Lee Yeseon"

617
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,670
Who's she?

618
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,131
A prime suspect with a strong motive.

619
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,884
Did you investigate Joo Hwayoung?

620
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,094
Three life insurances

621
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,887
and two billion of death benefit.

622
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,014
That's a lot.

623
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,140
But her family

624
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,474
is a real estate tycoon.

625
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,893
But real estate
is hard to liquidate.

626
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,396
She might've needed
quick cash for Bae Jinkyu.

627
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,231
And she hated her husband.

628
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,067
Autopsy results came out.

629
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,488
There were three stab wounds

630
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,282
One on abdomen and two on the back.

631
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,701
The ones on the back
are hesitation wounds.

632
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,328
Hesitation wounds?

633
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,496
He died between 10 and 11 p.m.

634
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,915
Means the criminal hesitated,
of course.

635
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,127
The victim
was turning his back, but they hesitated.

636
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,213
Why?

637
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,595
It's Oh Gyeongsun
who spilled the paint on the painting.

638
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,180
 Mr. Noh plagiarized

639
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,514
her daughter's painting,

640
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,184
and she thinks
her daughter killed herself for that.

641
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,477
She has that scarf.

642
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,896
 If it was for money, it's Joo.

643
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,439
If it was for revenge,

644
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,815
it's Oh.

645
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,027
Oh Gyeongsun said
she worked at night on the day,

646
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,529
so check CCTV there, Kyungjin.

647
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,614
Okay.

648
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,698
Check it thoroughly.

649
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,659
It's only 20 minutes
from the jjimjilbang to the gallery.

650
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,661
She could've got changed and gone out.

651
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,038
I'll dig into Bae Jinkyu.

652
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,290
I'll visit the taxi company.

653
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,334
What about me? What should I do?

654
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
- You?
- Yes, me.

655
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,549
You see that book?

656
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,884
Yes.

657
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,260
Study.

658
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,347
Stop playing a cop

659
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,474
with that locked-room murder stuff.

660
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,351
Or you can go clean your house.

661
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,646
Hey, I already have a lawyer's license.

662
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,041
Director Lee.

663
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,584
It's me.

664
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,723
This one looks better.

665
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,101
Hey, honey.

666
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,811
Really? I love you!

667
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,411
Hey, wait.

668
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,872
- Me?
-  Yes.

669
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,707
Police.

670
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,333
You know Bae Jinkyu,

671
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,751
right?

672
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,297
He's starting a business.

673
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,340
What kind of business?

674
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,551
I don't know.

675
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,178
He's still planning on it.

676
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,346
Oh, he said he found an investor.

677
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,849
Why?

678
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,646
Oh, yes.
I remember this passenger.

679
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,357
Was she this woman?

680
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,569
I don't think so.

681
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,654
Did you see her face?

682
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,780
No.

683
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,492
She was covering her face
and bending down her head.

684
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,077
How did she pay?

685
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,788
She paid in cash and left
without getting the change.

686
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,306
I'm here again.

687
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,477
Didn't the director call you?

688
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,647
I bought those two paintings.

689
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,316
Just a moment...

690
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,651
Yes.

691
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,488
Yes, he's here.

692
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,323
Oh...

693
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,034
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,744
Okay.

695
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,666
But this painting

696
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,417
is damaged.

697
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,628
It's not damaged,
but it became meaningful.

698
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,547
Haven't you heard about the artist

699
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,091
who shredded his painting
right after it was sold?

700
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,011
You're right.

701
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,096
I'll wrap this painting.

702
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,222
Okay.

703
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,077
Is this one also Mr. Noh's work?

704
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,329
No.

705
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,914
That's my work.

706
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,293
Mr. Noh let me share his studio.

707
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,258
I like this painting.

708
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,635
I like rainy days, too.

709
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,931
Do you know this painting?

710
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
Well...

711
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,727
A woman is lying under the water,

712
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,312
and...

713
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,772
she seems as if she's dead.

714
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,195
Oh.

715
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,116
Are you

716
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,909
talking about this one?

717
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,246
Oh.

718
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,331
<i>Ophelia</i>.

719
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,583
It's not what I'm saying.

720
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,917
That's another one.

721
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,211
It's seen from above.

722
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,422
Like...

723
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,549
The woman's face is blurred...

724
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,134
and...

725
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,719
Oh...

726
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,220
I don't know.

727
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,599
Okay.

728
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,851
And what about this place?

729
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,979
I'll have to clean it up.

730
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,731
I'll remove

731
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,775
all of my stuff.

732
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,279
I'll wrap the painting.

733
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,697
Okay.

734
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,001
Oh Gyeongsun
never left the jjimjilbang.

735
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,961
Taxi driver also said it was not her.

736
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,673
So it could be
Joo Hwayoung or Bae Jinkyu.

737
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,092
Bae Jinkyu spent a lot of cash recently,

738
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,260
and he found an investor for his business.

739
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,888
<i>How dare you!</i>

740
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,972
<i>You murderer!</i>

741
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,141
- <i>You, murderer!</i>
-  <i>Are you crazy?</i>

742
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,982
She knew

743
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,984
Oh Gyeongsun hated Mr. Noh...

744
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,530
And she must have known
that the gallery would replace the CCTV.

745
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,740
After disguising herself as Oh Gyeongsun,

746
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,991
she killed her husband.

747
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,786
Bae Jinkyu, the accomplice,

748
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,413
set an alibi for her.

749
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,416
Should we

750
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,875
arrest them now?

751
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,044
No, they must still be staying vigilant.

752
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,755
Let's summon them
tomorrow morning

753
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,258
when they begin to feel relieved.

754
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,426
That scarf...

755
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,052
I heard it's discontinued.

756
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,012
Find out where we can buy it.

757
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,305
Okay.

758
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
Mr. Choi!

759
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,621
Mr. Choi, Mr. Choi!

760
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,337
Ganghyun!

761
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,716
- What is it?
- Ganghyun!

762
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,259
Where are you?

763
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,511
Why?

764
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,804
It saw me, it saw me.

765
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,888
No, no.

766
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,515
4237, 4237!

767
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,849
4237, 4237!

768
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,017
Damn it!

769
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,217
You...

770
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,677
opened the door.

771
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,764
What's up?

772
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,018
What?

773
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,436
A rat.

774
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,147
What did you say?

775
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,440
There's a rat.

776
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,611
What the hell.

777
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,821
Hey, please, don't go!

778
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,865
Please.

779
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,701
I'm begging you.

780
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,244
Please?

781
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,330
You'll sleep in the tent?

782
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,999
Yes, it's easy and quick.

783
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,959
The rat could come back.

784
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,128
Why don't you just go to a hotel?

785
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,591
I can't drive. My legs are shaking.

786
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,718
I'll make it quick. Please keep watching.

787
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,555
Rat?

788
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,456
You really lived here before?

789
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,459
Yes, with my mom.

790
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,963
She suddenly passed away when I was seven.

791
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,423
That was when I heard

792
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,134
that I was a son of Hansu Group.

793
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,428
<i>I'm different.</i>

794
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,805
<i>I'm not a real silver spoon.</i>

795
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,267
What...

796
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,061
happened to your mom?

797
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,235
<i>Mom.</i>

798
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,575
<i>Mom!</i>

799
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,120
<i>Mom!</i>

800
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,123
<i>Mom.</i>

801
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,085
-  <i>Mom!</i>
-  <i>It was a car accident.</i>

802
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,003
<i>It's not that clear now.</i>

803
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,387
Now that I came back here,

804
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,264
it reminds me of the good old memories.

805
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,102
Okay.

806
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,192
- I'm leaving.
- Hey.

807
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,240
Thanks.

808
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,025
<i>I'll be late today.</i>

809
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,703
"Vermin Extermination Service"

810
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,010
You're starting a business?

811
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,846
Oh, that...

812
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,098
It's not a big deal.

813
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,933
It's just a sideline.

814
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,063
I'll take over a pension in Jeju.

815
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,189
Oh.

816
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,274
It must be expensive.

817
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,401
Is it around two billion?

818
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,238
Recently, Bae Jinkyu asked you
for cash for his business, right?

819
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,698
Yes, he did.

820
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,866
Two billion.

821
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,910
It's exactly the same amount

822
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,995
- as Mr. Noh's death benefit.
- Oh, it is?

823
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,455
I didn't know that.

824
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,915
You're a real estate tycoon,

825
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,709
but making quick cash of two billion
wouldn't be easy.

826
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,045
But now you have cash

827
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,505
for your young boyfriend.

828
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,549
I'll break up with him.

829
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,844
I bought him a car and clothes.

830
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,597
But I don't like him enough
to give him two billion.

831
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,349
If you think

832
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,642
that I killed my husband

833
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,936
to get the death benefit,

834
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,479
you got it wrong.

835
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,108
You'd better investigate
Kwon rather than me.

836
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,652
Why?

837
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,363
Because he has a motive of murder.

838
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,201
But isn't he the last person
who would want

839
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,328
Mr. Noh to be dead?

840
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,163
To be a professor or to debut,

841
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,706
he needed Mr. Noh's help.

842
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,333
Noh didn't help him with that

843
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,794
and just made slaves of him
for over ten years.

844
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,880
No wonder Mr. Kwon was preparing
to study abroad in secret.

845
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,258
He was preparing to study abroad?

846
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,427
Yes. He was going to get a support
from the Artist Foundation.

847
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,768
She's lying.

848
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,521
She'll run away
while we're suspecting Kwon.

849
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,481
We should check it anyway.

850
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:32,983
Okay.

851
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,484
I'll watch those two, then.

852
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,156
Thank you.

853
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,880
Huh?

854
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:17,027
 It won't be simple
because it's related to a foreign company.

855
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,530
I'll contact Attorney Lee,

856
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,407
and let's go see him together.

857
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,242
Okay.

858
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,162
Is it tough?

859
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,706
Yes, it is.

860
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,208
This is too big for me.

861
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,211
Can't you just come back?

862
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,089
You're not the one
to serve the conglomerate family.

863
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,091
That's my last job.

864
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,681
Hello.

865
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,016
Mr. Choi, I have a favor.

866
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,811
All right.

867
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,816
Who is the leader
of the Electric Laboratory Team?

868
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,153
<i>I told them to look at it.</i>

869
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,697
"Radiation-controlled Area
No unauthorized entry."

870
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,747
A sign was left first

871
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,124
before a new painting was added on it.

872
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,212
Why did he do that?

873
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,073
"Used Market"

874
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,797
Mr. Kwon.

875
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,177
You're done tidying up?

876
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,931
Yes.

877
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,182
Where are you going?

878
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,267
Far away?

879
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,105
What's up?

880
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,565
Oh.

881
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,608
I spent a fortune to buy it,

882
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,360
but there's a problem.

883
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,826
There's a famous painting by Millet
called <i>The Angelus</i>,

884
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,619
where a couple pray in the field.

885
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,957
There's a basket with potatoes inside.

886
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,419
But originally,

887
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,296
it was a coffin.

888
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,049
This peaceful drawing

889
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,800
was actually

890
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,054
about a sad couple who lost their baby.

891
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,641
Oh.

892
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,352
You can confirm it by X-ray.

893
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,147
Mr. Kwon was selected

894
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,191
but it was cancelled.

895
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,734
Why?

896
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,736
His academic adviser called.

897
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,404
He said Mr. Kwon's portfolio

898
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,573
was plagiarized.

899
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,867
When did he call?

900
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,452
It was a week ago.

901
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,876
Was it a woman who bought this scarf?

902
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,045
<i>No, it was a man.</i>

903
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,630
Just a moment.

904
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,966
Can I switch to a video call?

905
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,093
<i>Yes.</i>

906
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,182
Was it this man?

907
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,851
<i>No.</i>

908
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,645
<i>Wait.</i>

909
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,901
<i>It was this man next to him.</i>

910
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,074
I dropped the painting
while I was hanging it,

911
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:54,077
and I found a totally different color
on the damaged area.

912
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,079
So, I took an X-ray of this painting.

913
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,040
- Yes.
- The one who bought the scarf

914
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,125
was Kwon Dojun.

915
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,168
I talked with the seller.

916
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,629
Check where he is and tell me.

917
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,172
Call Junyoung, too.

918
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,969
Then I found this.

919
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,149
There's a signature that is not Mr. Noh's.

920
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,444
Under Mr. Noh's painting,

921
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,904
why is your signature hidden?

922
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,756
"Jin Isoo attacked by the prime suspect
What will happen?"

923
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,384
Special thanks to Jang Kyuri

924
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,492
 I found him dead.

925
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,576
It's not me.

926
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,578
Mr. Kwon was found dead this morning.

927
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,787
The real culprit is...

928
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,539
 We don't have a proof.

929
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,041
 Wasn't there a key?

930
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,250
 I can catch him.

931
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,794
 What kind of world
are you living in?

932
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,046
 Ganghyun!

933
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,631
This is a murder case.

934
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,716
A rice cake was stuck in his throat.

935
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,843
If it's chewed, it gets teeth marks.

936
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,345
No teeth mark here.

937
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,721
And this is missing.

938
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,891
-  If it's the real National Seal--
- Can it be?

939
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,227
Similar cases occurred
three times in a month.

940
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,728
this is a serial case.

941
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,938
No fingerprints found.

942
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,022
Let's set a trap.

943
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,690
The secret auction at 2:00 a.m.

944
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,234
To the back door! Stop!

945
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,485
Exactly a billion.

946
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,694
Gosh, you're so...

947
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,779
No wonder.

948
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,988
- Hello.
- They're here.

949
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,114
Right. They're two.

950
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,199
Drop the syringe!

951
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,325
Drop it!

952
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,452
