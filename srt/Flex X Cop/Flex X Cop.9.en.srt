377
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,720
I told her to come back
whenever she wanted,

378
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,639
but your mom...

379
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,849
rejected it.

380
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,312
Now, this baby is my dream and future.

381
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,232
I want to raise my baby well.

382
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,777
I've already named my baby.

383
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,612
"Isoo."

384
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
[Jeonghun] You know

385
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,039
what your name means, right?

386
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,266
[police1] We arrested the CEO
at the scene.

387
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,643
His clothes were covered in blood,
and according to the staff,

388
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,563
only he and the victim
were in the set last night.

and when I woke up--

394
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,114
We'll talk at the station.

395
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,074

- Station?

[Junyoung] There's no security cam
where the body was found.

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,915
Cams are only in the parking lot entrance

399
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,709
and at a few spots inside the set.

400
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,420
Who left here for the last yesterday?

401
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,006
[Seongho] Everyone left
almost at the same time

402
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,716
- before 10:00 p.m.
- [Sora] Right.

403
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,217
[Sora] Around 9:50 p.m.?

404
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,096
[Junyoung] Does the CEO
sleep in the set often?

[hesitating]

406
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,393
[Seongho] We don't know anything.

Did Han Yura and the CEO

408
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,733

409
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,488
- [Kahyean] We're not sure about that.
- [Seongho] We don't know.

410
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
[director] Hey, Seongho.
[car door closes]

411
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
Sir.

412
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,117
He's our director.

413
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,078
[Ganghyun] Lee Ganghyun
from Gangha Station.

414
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,581
Han Yura was found dead
in the set last night.

415
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,374
She was murdered.

416
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,459
What?

417
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,711
Jeez.

418
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,005
What time did you leave last night?

419
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,674
I left earliest because I'm the director!

420
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,053
Sir, how about a cigarette?
[director sighs]

421
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,555
[director] Damn, it's my first movie
in years!

422
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,307
- [director] You--
- Let's go.

423
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,391
- Okay.
- Yes.

424
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,316

428
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,259
[Junyoung] Last night,
she was in a different dress.

429
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,552
This is a movie costume.

430
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,971
The culprit changed her dress
after killing her?

431
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,764
They said she was here until late,

432
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
so she could have tried it by herself.

433

[Ganghyun sighs]

434
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,937
She was murdered here.

[Ganghyun] And he put the body
on this chair.

00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,900
[Junyoung] These scissors
belong to the stylists.

441
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,654
He didn't prepare the weapon in advance

442
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,572
but killed her accidentally.

443
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,164
Yura is dead?

444
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,958
[Sangtae] Let me go check her.

445
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,584

[Sangtae] I'm Yura's manager.

Please let me go check her.

449
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,968
- [Sangtae] It won't take long.
- [police2] Calm down first.

Last night...

455
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,275
I left here around 10:00 p.m.

456
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,610
What about Han Yura?

457
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,238
Don't you usually leave together?

[Sangtae] Yura.

462
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,580
You're going straight home, right?

463
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,750
You go ahead.
Someone will come pick me up.

- Call me.
- [Yura] Okay.

469
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,427
[Sangtae] She told me to leave.

470
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,928
She said she'd meet someone.

00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,346

Why?

It's not Mr. Kim Younghwan, right?

476
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,234
No. What about our CEO?

477
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,694
What was their relationship?

478
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,779
[Sangtae] Nothing special,
as far as I know.

479
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,740
He was arrested at the scene.

480
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,700

which is shot at the site separately.

- [Kyungjin] Yes.

I've met her once.

567
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,715
The suspect is the CEO
of the production company.

568

[Ganghyun] He was found at the scene
covered with blood.

00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,012
We found his fingerprints on the weapon.

570
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,972
He's my friend.

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,641
What?

572
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,019
We went to the same middle school.

573
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,271
I'll go see him.

574
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,148
Yes, go talk to him.

575
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,899
He's not saying anything.

576
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,198
[Younghwan urgently] Hey, Isoo!

I don't know. It's not me.

Why on earth

584
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,546
would I kill our actor?

[Younghwan] Don't you think so?

Isoo, you know

00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,509
how much effort I put
into this movie for many years.

00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,345

That's...

I did some drug yesterday.

You should trust me.

[Younghwan] It's not me!

You know, that set...

00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,866
Anyone can get in there easily.

600
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,496
You talked to him?

601
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,748
Younghwan is a smart guy.

602
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,125
And he's not the one who can kill someone.

603
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,087
The situation was unfavorable to him.

604
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,214
I don't suspect him.

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,883
Or...

607
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,760
as a detective?

608
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,349
Even a smart and calm person

609
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,518
can commit a murder.

610
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,982

[♪ mysterious music]

614
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,366
[Ganghyun] It takes intense anger

615
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,076
to accidentally murder someone.

616
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,954
But I don't see any of that.

617
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,790
How was the relationship
between Kim and Han?

618
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,335
Was there anyone
who didn't get along with Han?

619
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,753
It's hard to find out.

620
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,381
Because the staff don't tell us anything.

621
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,633
Staff can't say anything,

622
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,343
because they're employees.

623
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,762
Even if they knew something

624
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,848
about the CEO, actors, or the director,

625
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,183
it'd not be easy for them to say it.

626
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,685
They could be fired for that.

627
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,103
[sighing] What do we do?

628
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,648
We should find someone
more powerful than Younghwan.

Who's that?

630
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,527
I'll find the one.

739
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,639
How can I say?

740
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,974
Just interested?

741
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,726
[scoffs]

742
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,728
[sniffing]

743
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,730
[Ganghyun] On the day,

744
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,858
- you had a fight with her, right?
- [Namsu] Who said that?

745
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,235
It's Sora, right?

746
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,321
I should fire her, damn.

747
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,949
[Isoo] Wow, you're amazing.

748
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,661
Aren't you afraid of getting
a lot of hate for your rudeness?

749
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,871
[scoffs]

750
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,748
With this handsome face,

751
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,584
no one can hate me.
[Isoo scoffs]

752
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,502
You don't know about this world.

753
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,255
I know, but you're not handsome enough.

754
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,758
I heard Han Yura said
she'd reveal something.

755
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,385
[Ganghyun] What was that?

756
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,096
No idea.

757
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,390
You know, most actresses

758
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,017
are twisted like that.

759
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,269
[sighs]

760
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,188
What time did you leave the set?

761
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,608
Around 10:00 p.m.?

762
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,776
Where did you go?

763
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,904
Here.
[door opens]

764
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:22,988
Were you alone?

765
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,239
[Hyena] He was with me.

766
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,325
Hey. Gosh...

767
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,119
[Hyena] Why? It's true.

768
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,252
[Ganghyun] Let's talk in private.

769
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,547
Your ex-girlfriend just died,

770
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,466
and you're playing with another girl.

771
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,634
Hey.

772
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,471
A new love is the best
to get over an old love.

773
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,555
You don't know that?

774
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,474
What a bastard.

775
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,642
What?
[♪ rhythmical music]

776
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,894
[Isoo] Be a human before being an actor.

777
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,229
[scoffs]

778
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,272
I can tell

779
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,608
that you're a similar kind as me.

780
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,818
Goddamn it.

781
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,403
What did you say?
I always seek pure love.

782
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,571
[Isoo tutting]

783
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,323
Close those ugly legs.

784
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,866
[Isoo] You think that's cool?

785
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,619
Is it the right time for strawberries?

786
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,912
[Isoo clears throat]

787
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,249
[tutting]

788
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,001
[Jiwon] She died between 10:00 p.m.

789
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,336
[♪ dark music]
to 11:00 p.m.

790
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,880
The murder weapon
was scissors found at the site.

791
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,716
One wound on the back,
and three on the chest.

792
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,009
One of them was fatal.

793
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,554
Her lung was stabbed with that.

794
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,849
She was stabbed from the back
while trying to run away.

795
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,933
[Younghwan grunts]

796
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,184
[Jiwon] She resisted,

797
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,646
but couldn't get away.

798
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,608
[scissors wielding sound]

799
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,071
[Jiwon] It's so sad.

800
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,369
She was one of my favorite actors.

801
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,166
And...

802
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,964
I found this from the wound.

803
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,466
[♪ mysterious music]
[Junyoung] What's this?

804
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,135
It's from the victim's clothes.

805
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,179
[Jiwon] She was wearing
a red dress, right?

806
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,725
After she was killed,
[stabbing sound]

807
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,685
her clothes were changed.

808
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,938
[Junyoung sighs]
And there's one more.

809
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,359
[Jiwon] A skin tissue was found
under her nail,

810
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,819
and we analyzed its DNA.

811
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,573
But it was not Kim Younghwan's.

812
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,294
[Hyena] You want to see more?

813
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,338
That'll be a bit too sexy.

814
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,131
How long have you been dating?

815
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,841
Three days ago?

816
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,177
[Hyena] We first met at a club.

817
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,595
[phone vibrates]

818
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,183
[message alarm]
[Junyoung] DNA was found under her nail.

819
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,559
It's not Kim Younghwan's.

820
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,436
Thank you.

821
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,897
[Ganghyun] Mr. Ha, let me check your arm.

822
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,981
What?

823
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,442
[♪ dark music]
[Namsu sighs]

824
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,569
Here. You're done?

825
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,572
[Namsu] Why?

826
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,157
Oh, you wanted to touch

827
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,159
the body of a superstar, right?

828
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,203
You want a hug? Okay, come on.

829
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,288
[Isoo sighs]
[Ganghyun] No, thanks.

830
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,665
Thank you for cooperating.

831
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,875
[Isoo] Jeez.

832
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,126
[bottle thuds]

833
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,544
[Isoo] What the...

834
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,214
Gosh, that punk.

835
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,423
I could beat him.

836
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,716
[Isoo sighs]

837
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,177
There are so many punks like him.

838
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,846
[inhaling] They go haughty
when they become famous?

839
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,224
I'm not as rude as him, right?

840
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,102
We should charge for rudeness as a crime

841
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,520
[Isoo] and arrest them all.

842
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,813
[scoffs]

843
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,439
Why did you check his arms?

844
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,484
A DNA was found under the victim's nail.

845
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,362
And it doesn't match Kim Younghwan's.

846
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,489
So, there's the real culprit.

847
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,326
[Ganghyun] Must've been scratched
on the arm or neck while attacking her.

848
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,786
[shallow exclamation]

849
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,292
[Isoo breathing]

850
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,045
[Ganghyun] Any updates?

851
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,047
[Junyoung] I'm checking it now.

852
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,257
How about you?

853
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,343
[sighing] She had a fight with Ha Namsu,
so I met him,

854
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,678
but he has an alibi.

855
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,139
[Ganghyun] I asked for help to the hotel.

856
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,975
The culprit

857
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,227
[Junyoung] killed Han
[♪ dark music]

858
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,311
and went outside.

859
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,522
And they came back
[mouse clicking]

860
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,606
after all the staff left.

861
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,027
[Ganghyun] It's too dark to identify them.

862
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,528
Yes.

863
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,864
[Namsu] Hello, everyone. I'm Ha Namsu.

864
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,992
We're shooting
in a very pleasant atmosphere.

865
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,119
We'll do our best

866
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,746
to finish the shooting safely.

867
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,289
Keep up the good work!

868
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,791
[staff chattering]
Thank you.

869
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,876
Great job.

870
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,086
- Great job.
- [staff] Thank you.

871
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,840
[staff chattering]

872
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:52,966
[Sangtae] Yura.

873
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,092
Just a second.

874
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,886
[staff3] Great job.

875
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,601
You shot it well?

876
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,728
I got something to do.

877
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,525
[Sojeong] What?

878
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,653
[Isoo] Wait. Stop there.
[pressing enter key]

879
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,530
Rewind it.
[pressing enter key]

880
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,783
[Isoo] Yes, here.

881
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,992
Can you zoom it in?

882
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,077
[Kyungjin] Yes.

883
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,872
Play it again.

884
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,457
[pressing enter key]

885
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,667
[pressing enter key]

886
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,586
[Ganghyun] Beak Sanghee?

887
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,633
[Isoo] It's Beak Sanghee.

888
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,717
Beak Sanghee...

889
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,512
[call starting sound]

890
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,596
[line ringing]

891
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,139
Hello.

892
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,475
Who is Beak Sanghee's makeup artist?

893
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,852
Right.

894
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,938
"Im Sojeong
Beak Sanghee's makeup artist"

895
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,108
Sanghee hit Yura that day.

896
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,400
Why?

897
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,610
[Sojeong] I don't know.

898
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,196
She hit her all of a sudden,
so I was also puzzled.

899
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,740
[Ganghyun] Did they
usually get along well?

900
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,661
Well, yes. Not bad.
[shallow laugh]

901
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,581
I mean, Sanghee

902
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,875
is not so friendly to others.

903
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,002
Her nickname is Ice Witch.

904
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,130
She is somewhat cold, icy,

905
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,506
and scary.

906
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,342
I see.

907
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,885
[inhaling]

908
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,888
How did Beak Sanghee think about Yura?

909
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,807
[Sojeong] She envied her.

910
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,184
Yura was young, pretty,

911
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,311
[Sojeong laughing shallowly] and popular.

912
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,106
She said, "I was once like her,
but it would fly fast."

913
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,817
[Isoo exclaims shallowly]
She said so.

914
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,735
She must've been jealous.

915
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,780
[Isoo] She was a superstar
who swoop Best Actress Awards,

916
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,491
but had a long break after marriage
and got divorced.

917
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,035
She only acted supporting roles
since coming back.

918
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
Even worse,

919
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,956
those roles were
behind much younger actors.

920
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,833
[Sojeong] To get more lines,

921
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,586
she always had squabbles
with writers and directors.

922
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,631
[scoffing] Most actors want
to be in the center.

923
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,009
She often complained about Yura

924
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,094
[Sojeong] for taking most of her lines.

925
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,222
Oh, wait.

926
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,309
Are you suspecting Sanghee now?

927
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,560
What do you think?

928
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:13,023
What if Yura had done something annoying
to her on the day,

929
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,192
and Ms. Beak got pissed off?

930
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,196
Do you think she could commit a murder?

931
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,240
I'm not sure.

932
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,325
[shallow laugh]

933
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,453
[Sojeong] But...

934
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,456
I heard a rumor.

935
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,583
What's that?

936
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,336
[Sojeong] Two actresses
played main roles in a movie,

937
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,463
but those two didn't get along well.

938
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,965
Then, an accident occurred
at the shooting site,

939
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,551
and one got a severe wound on her face.

940
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,139
People said Sanghee had planned it all.

941
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,187
[Junyoung] This comb
had been used for her, right?

942
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,271
What?

943
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,607
Let me get some hair from it.

944
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,442
I'll take it.

945
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,444
- [Ganghyun] Hurry up.
- [Junyoung] Okay.

946
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,779
[door opens]

947
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,697
[door closes]

948
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,535
"Best Acting Award
Beak Sanghee"

949
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,620
[Isoo exclaims]

950
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,704
"Best Actress Award"

951
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,206
[shallow exclamation]

952
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,458
She's beautiful.

953
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,960
[Isoo inhaling]

954
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,503
[Isoo] Should I learn acting?

955
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,048
[Isoo exclaims shallowly]

956
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,259
Nice.

957
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,570
[manager] Ms. Beak.

958
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,407
Detectives have been waiting for you.

959
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,076
[Sanghee] I know.

960
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,953
I heard it earlier.

961
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,083
If they came without notice,
they should wait for me.

962
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,918
[brush thuds]

963
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,382
[sighing] Detectives?

964
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,640
Which one should I pick?

965
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,149
[exhaling]

966
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,902
[phone vibrates]

967
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,744
"Gene Test Result"

968
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,495
[♪ tense music]

969
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,625
What's up?

970
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,299
[Junyoung] DNAs detected
from the eight segments

971
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,384
of the evidence 19, Beak Sanghee's hair,

972
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,636
match 99.9%.

973
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,893
[footsteps echoing]

974
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,865
What brought detectives to my house?

975
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,534
[Sanghee] The culprit

976
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,704
was not caught yet?

977
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,050
[♪ closing theme]

978
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,261
"This world is full of lies.
You still want to know the truth?"

979
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,496
[Ganghyun] Han Yura

980
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,289
had a stalker?
[♪ rhythmical music]

981
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,333
[Kyungjin] She watched it before death.

982
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,960
He sneaked into her house.

983
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,211
[Junyoung] To remove the evidence?

984
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,379
[Ganghyun] SD card?

985
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,547
[Isoo] It's in there.

986
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,382
I'll buy Yongjeong Officetel.

987
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,466
It's 12 billion won.

988
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,759
[Namsu] You hate me?

989
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,844
No reply? Hey.

990
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,137
Please keep it a secret.

991
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,221
Damn.
[Yura groans]

992
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,514
Yes, I beat her.

993
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,182
[Sanghee] They said I planned it

994
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,143
because I was jealous of her.

995
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,603
[Isoo] She has the strongest motive.

996
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,647
[shaman] I smell a lot of blood.

997
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,024
Did he do something bad?

998
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,109
You're insane.

999
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,610
This can't make him confess.

1000
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,112
Let's start shooting again.

1001
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,448
[Isoo] We have to help Yura's soul

1002
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,283
leave this world.

1003
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,993
- Please help me.
- You okay?

1004
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,661
Cut! Scene okay!

1005
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,830
