4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,209
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,128
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,808
Everyone
has their own task

7
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,730
in their life.

8
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,817
But I've never believed that.

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,167
Living with no purpose

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,170
was not that bad.

11
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,383
But now...

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,347
a question was thrown into my life.

13
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,060
Now, I start my journey

14
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,605
to find an answer.

15
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,980
"Two months ago"

16
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,520
Mr. Choi.

17
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,069
Oh, you watched this?

18
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:30,793
"Jin Isoo vlog/free diving/dun-dun/Jaws!"

19
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,756
It's cool, isn't it?

20
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,965
Yes.

21
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,926
It's cool.

22
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,179
You didn't sleep well again?

23
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
No, I didn't. As always.

24
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,767
Management strategy meeting
begins in two hours.

25
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,352
What?

26
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,398
You should be there as the head
of the Management Strategy Team.

27
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,067
Jeez, I need more sleep.

28
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,902
Tell them I'm not available.

29
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,654
I'm so tired.

30
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,667
Where the hell are you now?

31
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,263
"A kidnapping case occurred"

32
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,070
A case occurred.

33
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,073
Get the support team ready.

34
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,568
- The status?
- 30 kidnappers.

35
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,236
VIP is on the top floor.

36
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,936
Are you okay?

37
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
It was fun.

38
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,240
Rescue completed.

39
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,580
It's all skinned!

40
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,249
Jeez... I got too much blood on my suit.

41
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,877
What if I can't get this stain out?

42
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
Hey?

43
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
Wow, you're a great actor.

44
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,590
I know I am.

45
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,634
You should pay for my laundry, though.

46
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,885
I'll pay double.

47
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,969
See you next time.

48
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,929
Okay, then.

49
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
Hey, wait.

50
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,224
You seem familiar.

51
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
No way.

52
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,940
- Let's go.
- Okay.

53
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,629
Let's check
the damage.

54
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,798
It'll be cleared in three hours.

55
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,935
Jin Isoo, Jin Isoo!

56
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,270
Do wealthy people play like that?

57
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,565
He is different.

58
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,069
He even risks his life to play.

59
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,369
Stop there, Oh!

60
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,789
"Choi Kyungjin, Park Junyoung

suspected murderer"

62
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,627
Stop? My ass.

63
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
Stop, you punk!

64
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,227
"Lee Ganghyun, leader
of Violent Crime Investigation Team 1"

65
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,771
"Danger"

66
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,381
You're arrested for a robbery and murder.

67
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,925
Drop the knife.

68
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,303
Shit! What you're gonna do?

69
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,614
You hit him with a car?

70
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,865
I used a taser.

71
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,826
How dare you! Jeez...

72
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,220
Damn it.

73
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,389
Where's your friend?

74
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,557
I don't know.

75
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,355
You see that?

76
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,857
Confess before it's recharged.

77
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,108
Or I'll shoot again.

78
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,280
-Please, don't.
-She will.

79
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,242
She put her life on arresting criminals.

80
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,868
Right.

81
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,209
I swear I don't know.

82
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,627
Three people died.

83
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,920
Stop lying.

84
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,713
I don't know who he is.

85
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
My cellmate introduced this job to me.

86
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,886
I thought the place was empty,
but he killed everyone there.

87
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,055
I was scared, so I just ran.

88
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,476
Call and summon him.

89
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,312
How can I do that?

90
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,397
-Kyungjin.
-Yes.

91
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
Okay, okay.

92
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,985
I'll do it.

93
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,319
Please don't use a taser.

94
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,238
Shit.

95
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,534
Goddamn it.

96
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm calling now.

97
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,046
It hurts, I mean it.

98
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,050
Kyungjin, I'll write a report.

99
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,886
-You prepare a montage.
-Okay.

100
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,391
"Father, two children"

101
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,726
"Victim Park Eunah"

102
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,561
"stabbed in the stomach"

103
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,063
"Victims: Park Kiyul,
Park Eunah, Park Chaehyun"

104
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,277
"Oh Byeongsu, hammer
Accomplice, knife"

105
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,655
"Appointed place: Gangha-2 dong,
Food Alley next to Hansu Dpt."

106
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,949
Let's split into three groups.

107
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,868
Junyoung and Kyungjin take Oh Byeongsu

108
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,411
-to the appointed place.
-Okay.

109
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,954
-Don't get caught.
-Okay.

110
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
And team 2,

111
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,291
please stand by at the alley nearby.

112
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,251
Let's go.

113
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,007
He has slanted eyes

114
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,717
like an evil. More.

115
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,511
Okay, that's it.
And he had inner double eyelids.

116
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,306
He just looked like a chicken.

117
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,225
Is that a chicken?

118
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,519
I mean it. He has a chicken-like face.

119
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,532
Hey, Isoo!

120
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,910
We rented the whole club thanks to you!

121
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,454
Have a drink.

122
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,544
Where's Younghwan?

123
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,283
Huh?

124
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,826
My friend, Jin Isoo...

125
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,166
Younghwan, you, again!

126
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,835
Isoo, you want to try, too?

127
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,132
No, no...

128
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,967
No! Please... Don't!

129
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,218
Hey, hey!

130
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,310
I told you I'd never see you
if you did it again.

131
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,604
I can make your company closed.

132
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,150
Leaving?

133
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,985
Please pay for parking.

134
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,822
Get me my bike
and call a driver service.

135
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,240
Okay.

136
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,957
Stay put.

137
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,882
Hey.

138
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,801
Isoo, where are you?

139
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,302
Well...

140
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,013
Wasting my time somewhere.

141
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,141
I made it clear
you had to be at today's meeting.

142
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,852
I couldn't go due to the Code Zero case.

143
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,729
You played cops again?

144
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,107
Yeah, I rescued a super beauty today.

145
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,735
The press conference is due in nine hours.

146
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,365
Father would be humiliated if I go there.

147
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,449
Isoo...

148
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,660
Please listen to me.

149
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,122
Okay.

150
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,498
I'll be there in time.

151
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
Stop playing and go home.

152
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,099
Ganghyun barked up the wrong tree again.

153
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,273
How long should we stand by?

154
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,817
It's been two hours. He's not coming.

155
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,199
They say
it's time to close the bar.

156
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,536
Okay, let's wrap it up.

157
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,037
Thanks for your hard work.

158
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,206
Junyoung, take Oh to the station.

159
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,749
Mister...

160
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,209
Please give me a light.

161
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,170
Hey, hey...

162
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,630
Light...

163
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,340
- Light...
- Younghwan!

164
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,342
Please? Lend me a lighter.

165
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
What was that?

166
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,060
Damn it. Are you okay?

167
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,021
- It hurts.
- That punk.

168
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,294
Gosh...

169
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
Damn, it hurts.

170
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,142
What the hell?

171
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,769
You want to stab me, too?

172
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,442
I learned MMA professionally.

173
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,328
Goddamn.

174
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,746
Hey, stand up.

175
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,997
Hey

176
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,102
Get up!

177
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
Let go.

178
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,739
Hold on.

179
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,292
You're using a knife? How mean!

180
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,763
Go to hell.

181
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,739
Damn it.

182
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,768
Hey, are you okay?

183
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,062
Hey.

184
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,024
Damn it.

185
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,609
Hey.

186
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,652
Are you his friend?

187
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,325
Which team are you with? SWAT?

188
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,452
Whatever! Get off of me.

189
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,248
What?
Are you pretending to be a cop?

190
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,250
Gosh...what?

191
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,545
You're arrested for a special assault.

192
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,797
You'll regret it.

193
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,470
You're here.

194
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,361
He's the youngest son of Hansu Group.

195
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,488
Jin Isoo.

196
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,491
Jin Isoo?

197
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,826
We arrested Jin Isoo?

198
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,079
-You know him?
-Of course, I do. He's a celebrity.

199
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,332
"Jin Isoo"

200
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,459
"Strategy Management Team, Hansu Group"

201
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,996
He's awesome, isn't he?

202
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
He's an attention seeker.

203
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,748
What a freak.

204
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,460
He rented a mall
for a survival game today.

205
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,961
Woah, he's awesome.

206
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,338
That freak is awesome?

207
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
He's the son of a rich family anyway.

208
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,718
How fun would his life be?

209
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,804
What's he saying?

210
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,930
Says his nose broke.

211
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,186
Let's go out for a soju.

212
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,146
- Yes.
- Lee Ganghyun!

213
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,318
What the hell did you do?

214
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,157
You did a great job.

215
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,827
The son of Hansu Group
instead of a murderer?

216
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,622
You even broke his nose!

217
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,209
He assaulted a passerby
in a drunken state.

218
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,793
Just release him.

219
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,670
Don't complicate the situation.

220
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,340
No, I can't. He was caught in the act.

221
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,592
What did you say?

222
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,391
Once we arrest someone,
we must investigate them.

223
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,685
It'll look weird
if we just release him now.

224
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,313
Don't interrupt.

225
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,276
Your team is such a mess.

226
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,197
We'll make it quick. Don't worry.

227
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,115
Stop making trouble.

228
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,160
Don't make a fuss, you punk.

229
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,620
Yes, sir.

230
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,461
Hey.

231
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,548
Get it right.

232
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,509
Yes!

233
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,904
So...

234
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,698
What do we do now?

235
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,742
I don't know.

236
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,383
Why didn't you tell me

237
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,719
you're the son of Hansu Group?

238
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,805
You didn't give me a chance.

239
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,975
Look forward to the letter of complaint.

240
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,269
It must've been tough.

241
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,062
You can go home now, sir.

242
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,149
Okay. Remove it.

243
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,233
You expected this?

244
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,194
Sit down.

245
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,322
No special treatment.

246
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,286
Name, Jin Isoo.

247
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,538
Social security number is 92119...

248
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,458
What are you doing?

249
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm investigating.

250
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,547
You assaulted a passerby
at 2:00 a.m. on September 4th.

251
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,965
Right?

252
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,133
No.

253
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,011
How about you?

254
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,182
Corrupt assault against the Act
on the Aggravated Punishment.

255
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,266
Right?

256
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,269
-How smart!
-Article 125 of the Crime Act.

257
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,064
If a judge, prosecutor, cop,
or any other individual

258
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,192
involved in the restraint
of the human body

259
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,195
commits violence or cruelty
against a criminal suspect

260
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,197
or another person

261
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,159
while performing their duties, they
shall be imprisoned for up to 5 years,

262
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,371
and their qualifications
shall be suspended for up to 10 years.

263
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,834
I have a lawyer's license.

264
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,753
In this case, you can be dismissed.

265
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,879
For what

266
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,465
did a rich son need that license?

267
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,134
Well...

268
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,011
Maybe I was too bored.

269
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,724
Corrupt assault?

270
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,185
But what if that was necessary

271
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,562
to arrest a flagrant offender?

272
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,108
So, what you did today...

273
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,610
playing a survival game at the mall,

274
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,195
drinking at a club,

275
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
and doing some drugs?

276
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,826
I'm not a junkie.

277
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,828
We'll see the test result.

278
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,414
A rich son who has nothing to do

279
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,416
and nothing to be scared of.

280
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,501
You've never taken

281
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,628
any responsibility, right?

282
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,092
You know me so well.

283
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,593
Are you my follower?

284
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,678
I just know it.

285
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
I know a lot of rich bastards like you

286
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,224
who are never indicted after arrest.

287
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,935
That's because of your incapability.

288
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,562
But I think I can do it.

289
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,732
He had a knife.

290
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,150
I protected myself.

291
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,193
There was no knife at the scene.

292
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,446
And I'm not the cop

293
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,907
who goes easy on someone

294
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,117
with money and power.

295
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,411
I do have money and power,

296
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,496
but it was clearly a self-defense.

297
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,708
My friend got hurt by his knife.

298
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,213
Call him and check.

299
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,103
Hello?

300
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,522
This is Lee Ganghyun
in Gangha Police Station.

301
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,693
Jin Isoo was arrested
as a special assault flagrant offender.

302
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,653
He says the victim had a knife

303
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,614
and you were stabbed.

304
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,241
-Is it true?
-No way.

305
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,494
Nothing like that happened.

306
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,620
Okay, thanks.

307
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,209
He says

308
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,461
it never happened.

309
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,880
Maybe your friend

310
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,507
doesn't want to lie.

311
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,092
Make a call.

312
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,594
You'll need

313
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,262
expensive lawyers.

314
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,848
I don't need a lawyer.

315
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,434
I did nothing wrong.

316
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,238
Take off your shoes.

317
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,950
Jeez...

318
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,536
An innocent civilian is caught.

319
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,332
And your socks, too.

320
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,918
My socks?

321
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,756
It's part of the process.

322
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,844
Okay, then.

323
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
Jeez...

324
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,103
Why didn't you hold me?

325
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,733
Hey, hold on.

326
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,902
I'm so thirsty.

327
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,821
Can I have an iced Americano?

328
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
How many are here?

329
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,324
It's on me.

330
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,201
Okay?

331
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,041
Woah!

332
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,002
You're Jin Isoo, right?

333
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,086
I'm your big fan.

334
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,754
Oh, are you? Okay...

335
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,882
You should do it like this.

336
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,966
Oh, yes.

337
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,718
Don't get too close to me.

338
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,136
-Okay.
-Please sit down...

339
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,637
Sit down.

340
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,559
Goddamn it!

341
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
Somebody puked here.

342
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,354
What did he eat?

343
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,023
Hey, someone puked here!

344
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,400
Gosh...

345
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,990
Get some sleep.

346
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,202
Damn it.

347
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,329
Hey, Chohui.

348
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,788
Guess who we arrested today.

349
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,498
It's someone huge.

350
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,833
I shouldn't say his name,

351
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,043
but he is

352
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,210
Jin Isoo.

353
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,545
Jin Isoo.

354
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,548
Not Chang Isoo, but Jin Isoo.
Isn't it awesome?

355
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,674
So, I...

356
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,468
"Lee Giseok
reporter in SBC"

357
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,553
Mr. Park!

358
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,805
Wedding plan's going well?

359
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,682
Oh, hello, Mr. Lee.

360
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,727
Let's eat together
before your hell gate opens.

361
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,270
Yes, why not?

362
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,691
Get me a drink!

363
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,276
Get some drink!

364
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,028
Hey, shut up, there.

365
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,571
What are you?

366
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,265
Here's your statement.

367
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,644
Where's Isoo?

368
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,106
He's coming in time.

369
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,651
Assign Isoo

370
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,528
to the overseas branch.

371
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,948
He's a failure.

372
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,368
I put everything on the line.

373
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,995
I'll definitely win.

374
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,791
A failure shouldn't walk around
at this crucial moment.

375
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,364
You look great, honey.

376
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,757
Hello.

377
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,342
I'm the chairman of Hansu,
Jin Myeongchul.

378
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,096
I'm here today
to give you an announcement

379
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,140
which is very important.

380
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,101
My father, the former chairman

381
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,479
always said to me,

382
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,025
"You're the one who decides
and takes responsibility."

383
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,736
"No matter how hard it is,"

384
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,239
"always take the right way,
not an easy way."

385
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,327
"Candidacy declaration
For better Seoul"

386
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,038
I, Jin Myeongchul,

387
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,665
will run for the mayor of Seoul,

388
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,461
which I believe is the right thing to do.

389
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,695
All those charity
and scholarship work

390
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,240
which you've done so far,
were for the election?

391
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,743
I firstly
made a support foundation

392
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,245
25 years ago.

393
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,789
If I had known this at that time

394
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,041
I'd not be here today.

395
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,169
I'd be a fortune-teller.

396
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,925
Your rival is a leading member
of the ruling party.

397
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,426
Do you think you can win?

398
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,641
You would know better than me

399
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,602
what I've gone through to be here.

400
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,271
I never play

401
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,856
a game I'll lose.

402
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,441
Do you know
your youngest son is detained

403
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,985
in Gangha Police Station now?

404
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,865
I heard the victim is unconscious now.

405
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:08,124
"Assault case at dawn
by an immature rich son."

406
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,177
Hey, Jin Isoo.

407
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,639
Jin Isoo!

408
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,058
Gosh... It's cold.

409
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,323
Bro!

410
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,241
-Just keep sleeping.
-Oh, okay.

411
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,495
Come out.

412
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,499
You should've got it right.

413
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,710
You detained a suspect without checking.

414
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,879
Just say it.

415
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,255
I'm waiting.

416
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,176
-Waiting for what?
-Apologize when you made a mistake.

417
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,510
A mistake?

418
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,720
You know I was right.

419
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,309
I misunderstood I could arrest anyone
in the criminal act even if he's rich.

420
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,852
Next time you get caught,

421
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,479
you'll never escape again.

422
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,441
Why don't you reflect
on what you did first?

423
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,525
Hey.

424
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,570
Mr. Choi.

425
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,656
Gosh, my nose hurts.

426
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,075
Please get in.

427
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,368
Okay.

428
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,254
Father.

429
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,886
The press conference

430
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,638
went well?

431
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,611
Please leave them alone.

432
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,665
I told you to behave
until the election ends.

433
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,792
Is it that hard?

434
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,965
You know what you've done?

435
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,467
Something that you hate, maybe.

436
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,263
What's your limit?

437
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,181
I don't know.

438
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,183
I didn't hit the rock-bottom yet.

439
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,565
I shouldn't have let you in
in the first place.

440
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,360
It was my mistake
to try to bear you as a son.

441
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,031
You tried to bear me?

442
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,992
I didn't know that.

443
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,040
Seungju,

444
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,334
you're my only son from now on.

445
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,044
Fire Jin Isoo.

446
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,046
Our legal team will leave this case.

447
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,926
Whether you go to jail or pay a fine,

448
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,595
handle all of these...

449
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
on your own.

450
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,560
You...

451
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,272
are nothing without me.

452
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,249
Jeez...

453
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,420
Why didn't you call me?

454
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,758
I didn't want to bother to.

455
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,093
It's not a big deal.

456
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,763
You didn't want to humiliate him, right?

457
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,641
Why didn't you just tell him?

458
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,101
It's not that.

459
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,061
You know I'm a mess.

460
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,312
I've been Father's...

461
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,314
no...

462
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,149
the chairman's failure.

463
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,699
I'll talk to Father for you.

464
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,576
And...

465
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,913
I'll settle all things down. Don't worry.

466
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,792
Seungju.

467
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,962
I didn't do anything wrong.

468
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,465
It was not my fault.

469
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,270
You should've got it right.

470
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,148
He had a knife.

471
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,024
I protected myself.

472
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,206
"Fingerprint chekced"

473
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,177
"Background check result"

474
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,599
Are you sure?

475
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,186
Yes, I checked with Oh Byeongsu.

476
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,647
Goddamn it.

477
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,275
Who is he?

478
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,777
Lee Changhyun, a 43-year-old man

479
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,529
with two convictions for robbery.

480
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,533
I have only six months to retire, damn it.

481
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,867
What's your plan?

482
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,287
How will you make up for it?

483
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,583
I'll release Jin Isoo first

484
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,334
and announce the result.

485
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,711
Announce?

486
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,878
What will you say?

487
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,132
Get out.

488
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,679
I told you. Get out.

489
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,568
Isn't Jin here for assault?

490
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,236
That's what we thought

491
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,821
but the victim was a murderer.

492
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,905
A murderer?

493
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,575
Of the Gangha 2-dong case.

494
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,035
The family murder?

495
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,244
Keep it down.

496
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,329
It's confidential.

497
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,543
-Check it out.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,422
It's going to be

499
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,799
a bombshell when revealed.

500
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,804
Tell them it was Ganghyun's own decision

501
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,389
and cancel her position.

502
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,183
That's not bad,

503
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,101
but I'm not sure if that'd be enough.

504
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,938
Because of her father's case

505
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,982
the press will like it.

506
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,700
Excuse me, sir.

507
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,410
You have a guest.

508
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,079
I told you not to interrupt.

509
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,916
You have the same issue as mine.

510
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,042
So, let me interrupt.

511
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,796
I don't need any drink.

512
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,810
Have a seat.

513
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
Well...

514
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,578
What do you mean by the same issue?

515
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,921
My brother caught an offender

516
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,383
of a robbery and murder case of a family.

517
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,473
That's our issue, right?

518
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,396
It's not your fault.

519
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,815
It's you who found out he was the culprit.

520
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,860
They've got a good reason to kick me out.

521
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,867
I'll go talk to them.

522
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,119
Don't take my side.

523
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,039
I should take
the responsibility anyway.

524
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,461
So, we're planning

525
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,505
to release your brother immediately

526
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,966
and close the case as self-defense.

527
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,050
You think...

528
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,847
that's enough?

529
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,435
Our chairman's declaration for candidacy

530
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,521
was insulted.

531
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,108
We'll take the responsibility

532
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,735
for all of those--

533
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,944
Responsibility...

534
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,741
That's the word
for those who are capable of it.

535
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,036
Your plan is just...

536
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,914
to cover everything,

537
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,125
isn't it?

538
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,135
To keep the dignity of the police

539
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,515
and restore
the chairman's image

540
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,977
I suggest this.

541
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,196
You should take action right now.

542
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,297
Oh...

543
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,632
Coffee? Nice!

544
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,634
Yeah, yeah, enjoy it.

545
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,433
Oh, I'm finally breathing.

546
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,726
And get changed.

547
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,190
Gosh, it stinks.

548
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,907
You can drink it at a time like this?

549
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,161
How's your nose?

550
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,206
Don't ask. I can't even breathe well.

551
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,876
That fuzz...

552
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,379
I don't even know her name.

553
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,714
I'll sue her.

554
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,966
A criminal complaint for corrupt assault

555
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,050
and you...

556
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:09,970
By the way,

557
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,263
what about me?

558
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,347
Self-defense, right?

559
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,143
You are so lucky.

560
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,020
Lucky? I broke my nose

561
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,105
and slept next to an old man in a jail.

562
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,857
The guy you caught

563
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,026
was a murderer...

564
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,361
What?

565
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,822
of a family murder case in Gangha 2-dong.

566
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,075
No way.

567
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,537
So, I'll get an award
for good citizenship or something?

568
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,874
It's more than that.

569
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,126
You'll get to work...

570
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,379
as a police officer.

571
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,051
What?

572
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,304
We'll tell them he's been working

573
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,348
as a cop for two months.

574
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,311
He can be specially employed

575
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,438
with the lawyer's license.

576
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:07,110
He's been working together with cops
to catch the murderer.

577
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,820
It's our story.

578
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,905
Wait...

579
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,865
You think that makes any sense?

580
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,408
Make it make sense.

581
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,410
You'll do the press conference.

582
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,204
Sir...

583
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,914
you can't cover it like that.

584
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,374
Let's just...

585
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,167
process it by the book.

586
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,421
What?

587
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,631
By the book?

588
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,009
"The son of a chairman caught a murderer"

589
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,553
"that police has failed to catch
for two months."

590
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,930
Sounds good?

591
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,351
What if we tell them
the police arrested that brave civilian

592
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,435
and broke his nose?

593
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,440
Your team would be broken up
to be sent to local offices

594
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,692
with 3-month wage cut.

595
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,193
If they want,

596
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,320
you could be dismissed.

597
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,076
You want to be like your dad?

598
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,870
You really want that?

599
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,584
It's not only for you.

600
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,963
It could humiliate the whole organization.

601
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,935
Hey, what are you talking about?

602
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,895
Me working as a cop all of a sudden?

603
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,231
Upper line also agreed with it.

604
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,859
It's the only way.

605
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,694
We'll let Jin work at our station

606
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,989
and announce that
he's been investigating with us.

607
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,742
We've already talked about it
with Hansu Group.

608
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,702
He won't hold it out

609
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,454
for a long time, anyway.

610
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,956
This is good for everyone.

611
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,709
Father runs for the mayor for our country,

612
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,336
and you become a cop
to serve for the society.

613
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,173
This will also restore your image.

614
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,758
What's there to restore?

615
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,634
I already have a good image.

616
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,719
Good image on SNS?

617
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,679
That's not real.

618
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,016
That's why I like SNS.

619
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,810
They like me for no purpose.

620
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,486
What if you are indicted
for assault and go on trial?

621
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,197
Do you think

622
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,406
they'd still like you?

623
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,075
Do you think so?

624
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,037
We agreed to cooperate,
so it won't be that hard.

625
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,998
Just behave yourself
until the election ends.

626
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,043
Okay.

627
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,962
Let's just think
that you're playing cops, as always.

628
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,302
No way.

629
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,678
I won't do that.

630
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,139
This mayor election

631
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,935
had been
Father's long-cherished ambition.

632
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,439
People are now laughing at it.

633
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,360
That's none of my business.

634
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,195
You heard it earlier.

635
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,239
We're not a family now.

636
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,151
We'll announce
the investigation result

637
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,028
for the family murder case

638
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,030
and Jin Isoo's assault case.

639
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,449
On July 3rd, Jin Isoo became a cop

640
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,660
through special hiring for lawyers

641
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,204
to work in the Violent Crime
Investigation Team 1

642
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,999
for the family murder case for two months.

643
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,419
He arrested the accomplice Oh Byeongsu

644
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,504
let him lure out the suspect

645
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,841
and started staking out at 12:00 a.m.

646
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
with the whole team.

647
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,552
And at around 2:00 a.m.

648
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,013
Jin spotted a suspicious man

649
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,472
and arrested the suspect.

650
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,601
Then, what about the exclusive report
by SBC?

651
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,738
That was...

652
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,827
a false report.

653
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,997
What was the process of his hiring?

654
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,919
It's you who copied it.

655
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,379
Stop copying other reporters' articles

656
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,882
and just check it by yourself!

657
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,550
Hang up!

658
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,556
You should've checked it as the chief!

659
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,766
Exclusive?

660
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,184
I swear I saw him.

661
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,187
Jin Isoo was detained in the station.

662
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,731
Hansu Group and Hwang Sunggu made it up.

663
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,857
It's Hansu Group.

664
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,193
So, don't complicate it anymore.

665
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,986
Let's say you made a mistake.

666
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,989
Get out.

667
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,876
It must have been tough, Manager.

668
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,422
I'm not a manager anymore.

669
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,467
I'm fired.

670
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,489
You can go now.

671
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,379
Hey, my friend Jin Isoo!

672
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,964
Who are you?

673
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,050
Hey, Isoo, I'm sorry.

674
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,176
Okay?

675
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,262
I shouldn't have done this

676
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,139
to you as a friend, but...

677
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,308
You know, I did a drug last night.

678
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,936
I'll get caught if they run a test now.

679
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,397
And I thought you'd be released soon.

680
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,648
Of course, you would.

681
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,483
You're the son of Hansu Group.

682
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,902
You'd get released
even if you killed a person.

683
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,614
Oh, I mean...

684
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,575
I know you're not that kind of guy.

685
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,581
Isoo...

686
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,957
I'm so sorry.

687
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,043
You want me to kneel down?

688
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,711
Hands off.

689
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,926
Annoying punk.

690
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,679
You got a treatment?

691
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,931
Uh? Yes...

692
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,309
Go, then.

693
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,233
One special set,
two beers, and one soju, please.

694
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,318
Okay.

695
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,402
Hello.

696
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,907
Thanks.

697
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,669
That silver spoon

698
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,254
took away the culprit from us,

699
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,382
and I lied to the whole citizens.

700
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,258
Jeez... What the hell is going on?

701
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,677
You had no other way.

702
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,765
By the way, I'm so excited. You aren't?

703
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,017
Okay. I won't ask you why.

704
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,894
We're working with a rich man.

705
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,445
No way.

706
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,406
No way.

707
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,657
What?

708
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,575
He wouldn't come to work

709
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,452
but just slack off.

710
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,578
Seriously?

711
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,080
Gosh, I was so excited.

712
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,792
Excited about what?

713
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,337
If someone with money and power

714
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,714
is in our team, it'd be so much fun.

715
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,470
He's rich and powerful
but thoughtless.

716
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,473
The youngest of a rich family
would just power-trip.

717
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,558
No way!

718
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,643
My bro Isoo isn't that kind of rich.

719
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,019
Bro?

720
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,313
His followers call him bro.

721
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,233
Don't even dream
of calling me like that.

722
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,317
Why would I?

723
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,572
Are you on a mission to provoke me?

724
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,323
Workplace harassment!

725
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,367
Correct.

726
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,535
No way.

727
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,871
He'll never come to work.

728
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,295
Mom!

729
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,710
Hello.

730
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,547
I'm the vice chairman of Hansu

731
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
Jin Seungju.

732
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,592
I'm here today

733
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:16,970
to notify

734
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,430
the truth

735
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,893
about my brother's case.

736
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,402
The truth is...

737
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,247
I need to get approval
for closing the case of Lee Changhyun.

738
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,632
Jeez...
Ganghyun, I'm so sorry.

739
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,175
You'll face a lot of trouble.

740
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,430
I'll be fine.

741
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,141
We prepared something
to cheer your team up.

742
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,642
Show them.

743
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,477
Team 2, Gangha! Get ready!

744
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,104
Hey! Gangha!

745
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,781
You got this!

746
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,866
Good luck!

747
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,953
Byungsik.

748
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,038
Yes?

749
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,331
It's not funny.

750
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,457
Really?

751
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,584
-It's not funny?
-It is.

752
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,712
This is why I told you
to pass this case on me.

753
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,674
You lost the culprit
and got a silver spoon.

754
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,844
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

755
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,555
but that silver spoon
wouldn't come to work.

756
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,932
It's already half past 11.

757
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,644
That punk wouldn't even think
about coming here.

758
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,772
A red carpet.

759
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,483
Lay them all over.

760
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,323
Do we have an event today?

761
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,371
Yes, sir.

762
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,331
Okay.

763
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,666
Ms. Lee.

764
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,125
Chief wants us to come down.

765
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,561
"Welcome, Senior Inspector Jin Isoo"

766
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,148
Detective Jin!

767
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,484
Senior Inspector Jin Isoo

768
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,820
has been working confidentially

769
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,530
after being specially hired.

770
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,407
He didn't want a special treatment.

771
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,119
He just wanted to work and investigate
like other cops.

772
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,746
But as people with talent
always stand out,

773
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,457
he ended up revealing his excellence

774
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,751
-in this murder case.
-Gosh... He's awesome.

775
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:55,753
A precious talent like him

776
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,130
joined the police,

777
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,299
so, we'd like to give a hearty welcome!

778
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,849
What are you doing?

779
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,271
Podori, applause!

780
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,702
You prepared flowers...

781
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,120
-Camera.
-Yes.

782
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,249
It's cute.

783
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,472
Thank you.

784
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,393
Huh?

785
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,191
Wow, you didn't have to prepare
this much.

786
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,193
Thank you so much.

787
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,487
Oh.

788
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:04,822
Let's work hard.

789
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,357
"Hansu Group's son Jin Isoo
to investigate criminals?"

790
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,235
Special thanks to Kim Kim Eui-sung,
Ahn Seho, Oh Heejun,

791
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,614
Baek Jongwon, Park Seri, Yoo Heekwan,
Jung Chansung, and Cho Guesung

792
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,341
Where's my desk?

793
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,343
Stay put doing nothing.

794
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,637
You'd better
not bother my work.

795
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,931
Had you investigated properly,

796
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,724
I'd never been bothered like this.

797
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,476
A dead body at a quay.

798
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,436
Her face looks familiar.

799
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,813
She's a model.

800
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,357
Only real cops
can get into the site.

801
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,443
Is she always oppressive
and overbearing like that?

802
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,071
He'll get him alone

803
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,781
and move out if he fails.

804
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,617
- Stick behind me.
- I'm a good fighter.

805
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,202
Ms. Lee.

806
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,538
Let's go. We're late.

807
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,873
Stay tuned for bonus clip

808
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:42,795
Wait.

809
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,132
You're under arrest
for Jung Ina's murder. Got it?

810
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,468
You have the right to remain silent

811
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,096
and challenge the properness of arrest.

812
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,264
Hey, Mr. Park!

813
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,683
Mr. Park! Mr. Park!

814
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,521
Damn it.

815
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,026
