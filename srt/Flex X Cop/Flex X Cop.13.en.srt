5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,919
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,809
It's time to go.

7
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,352
Oh.

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,034
Why are you crying now?
You were so happy last night.

9
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,703
I'm not crying.

10
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,541
Honey, thank you
for holding out all of these.

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,711
Congratulations.

12
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,385
How do I look? Cool?

13
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,970
You look great.

14
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,270
Hey, Mr. Park.

15
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,943
Sir.

16
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,363
Please forgive me.

17
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,408
No. I'm sorry, too.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,747
Let me escort you.

19
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,334
See you at the station.

20
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,418
Okay.

21
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,549
Thank you.

22
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,098
You're crying again?

23
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,018
Certificate of appointment.

24
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,397
As of October 24, 2023,
Superintendent Lee Hyungjun

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,067
is appointed to the Senior Superintendent
of Seoul Gangha Police Station.

26
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,824
Congratulations.

27
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,908
Thank you.

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,509
Thank you.

29
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,401
The Seoul mayor election
is now one week ahead.

30
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,819
Here in SBC yesterday,

31
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,946
Jin Myeongchul from Future Hope Party

32
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,157
had a debate with Wang Jongtae
from National Liberal Party.

33
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,660
Here's what I think.

34
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,328
Mr. Jin is from a rich family,

35
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,247
and so are his two sons.

36
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,500
They never understand

37
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,085
how common people's life is.

38
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,713
So, how could he make a policy for them?

39
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,922
I think

40
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,383
a CEO and a Seoul mayor

41
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,843
basically do the same job.

42
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,511
They offer a vision,

43
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,388
revise unreasonable rules,

44
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,681
and promote welfare.

45
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,433
That sort of job

46
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,435
is in my area of expertise.

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,687
A company works
to make a profit.

48
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,481
What did your doctor say?

49
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,233
I was told to be careful.

50
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,359
It hasn't fully healed yet.

51
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,820
Come on, it's been several days
since you broke it.

52
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,989
With such a weak body,

53
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,450
how can you work as a detective?

54
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,493
Look at this smart-ass.

55
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,288
You should've given me CPR
instead of hitting me.

56
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
Hey.

57
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,207
I also did CPR.

58
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,840
CPR was not enough, so I hit you.

59
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,050
There was no other way.

60
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,512
Aren't you getting too cheeky
with the person who saved your life?

61
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,806
If I wasn't there, you--

62
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,725
Gosh, stop. It's enough.

63
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,352
You want any drink?

64
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,519
I'm going for a coffee.

65
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,688
-Vanilla latte.
-Okay, iced vanilla latte.

66
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,031
Wake up, Ganghyun!

67
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,449
Wake up!

68
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Bro.

69
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,046
I watched the chairman's debate.

70
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,256
You did?

71
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,549
He did so well.

72
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,219
It's easier said than done.

73
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,179
Oh, is one of them for me?

74
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,016
Oh.

75
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,476
I got it for myself,

76
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,812
but you can take it.

77
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,438
I'll vote for the chairman.

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,524
It's okay. Even I won't do that.

79
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,817
Really? Why?

80
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
I don't like both of the candidates.

81
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,195
Oh.

82
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,613
- Coffee for me?
- Hey.

83
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,615
No, it's for Ganghyun.

84
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,699
What about me?

85
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,826
Go buy it yourself.

86
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,577
You speak casually to each other?

87
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,787
It's been a few days.

88
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,871
You look so close.

89
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,748
We're not.

90
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,794
Yes, you are.

91
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,260
"Approval rating for candidates
Jin 46%, Wang 39%"

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,971
Let's go.

93
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,276
What's that?

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,403
Well, I don't know.

96
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,655
Tell them to move it.

97
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,823
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,957
Ma'am.

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,041
Oh.

100
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,969
Tell him to do it later. It's distracting.

101
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,429
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,565
- Gosh.
- What's up?

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,570
Ma'am.

104
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,405
You'd better not see that.

105
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,865
What's up?

106
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,035
There's... a man...

107
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,661
Why are you stammering?

108
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,413
-That's--
-Get off of me.

109
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
No.

110
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,935
Noeul-ro, Gangha-gu?

111
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
Okay, I'll be there.

112
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,357
A dead body was found.
Let's go.

113
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,305
Is this the scene?

114
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
Why?

115
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,520
It's my father's house.

116
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,733
Who's the victim?

117
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
It's an outsider.

118
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,852
In Jin Myeongchul's house?

119
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,730
Yes.

120
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
Was the victim identified?

121
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,696
No.

122
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,989
Not yet.

123
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,325
Team 1 is there.

124
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,785
Should we send the support team?

125
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
No.

126
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,539
Let's not make it complicated.

127
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,750
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

128
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,148
He climbed the wall.

129
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,232
Yes.

130
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,401
There's no bloodstain on the inner side of the wall.

131
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,695
Bloodstains were found outside.

132
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
Let's go check it.

133
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,552
He stepped on here

134
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,221
and climbed up the gate.

135
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,612
He was stabbed...

136
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,155
And drove all the way here.

137
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,620
I'll go talk to the witnesses.

138
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,982
Do you know who he is?

139
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,026
No. I've never seen him before.

140
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,780
Did the security alarm wail yesterday?

141
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,449
There's no alarm in the yard

142
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,451
because of cats and birds around here.

143
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,916
Did you notice
anything strange around the house?

144
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,335
Anyone suspicious?

145
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,420
No.

146
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,423
I didn't notice anything.

147
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,343
Who is inside now?

148
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,851
Ma'am.

149
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,770
Detectives are here.

150
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,773
Excuse me.

151
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,399
We're from Gangha Station.

152
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,530
Why are you here?

153
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,618
- I'm investigating.
- You're a detective?

154
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,453
- Get out!
- Calm down.

155
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,747
Please just answer a few questions.

156
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,833
About the dead body outside...

157
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,335
Do you know who he is?

158
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,340
No, I don't.

159
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,176
Where were you last night?

160
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,554
Stop making a fuss and leave.

161
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,264
I was at home yesterday.

162
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,604
We'll do when the investigation is done.

163
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,525
By the way,

164
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,612
how did he

165
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,531
die?

166
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,325
We're not sure yet,

167
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,118
but he seems to have been stabbed.

168
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,581
I don't have anything to tell you.

169
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,666
Stop asking me.

170
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,380
We might call you again.

171
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,464
Keep it.

172
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,805
What?

173
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,431
A dead body?

174
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,601
He seems to have died
while climbing over the wall.

175
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,854
Police officers
are investigating the scene.

176
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,193
Are you okay?

177
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,529
She's always been like that.

178
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,906
Kind of a consistent character.

179
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,409
Isoo.

180
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,869
Seungju.

181
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,121
What happened? Who's the victim?

182
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,874
We don't know yet.

183
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,085
Hello.

184
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,045
I'm Lee Ganghyun from Gangha station.

185
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,130
Oh, hello.

186
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
I'm Jin Seungju.

187
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
The victim
climbed over the wall

188
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,719
after being stabbed by someone.

189
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,512
What?

190
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,056
Did you have anything
on your mind

191
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,392
or anything bothering you recently?

192
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,187
No. Nothing special.

193
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,023
I see.

194
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
I heard my mother was shocked a lot.

195
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,818
I should go check her.

196
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,987
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

197
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,367
Seungju.

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,454
Are you okay?

199
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,747
I'm scared.

200
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,248
I'm so scared.

201
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
What happened?

202
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
Here's a light.

203
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,683
Why did he get into that particular house

204
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,102
while bleeding?

205
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,063
We'll figure it out after identifying him.

206
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,815
We identified him.

207
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,527
Han Daehoon, 59 years old.

208
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,195
No criminal record.

209
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,364
He was reported missing recently.

210
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,576
Let's go see his family.

211
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,787
Ask them to rush
on forensic analysis.

212
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,957
Check his dashcam
and the security cams in the alley.

213
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,294
He...

214
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,547
was dead?

215
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,551
You're not shocked.

216
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,972
I knew this would happen

217
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,391
someday.

218
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,185
He disappeared

219
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,895
six months ago.

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,442
He needed to be declared missing
if I wanted to divorce him.

221
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,194
That's why I reported him.

222
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,322
Why did you think

223
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,450
Mr. Han Daehoon would die?

224
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,497
I married him ten years ago.

225
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,250
At first,

226
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,377
he was a decent businessman.

227
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,047
But he closed one business

228
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,716
and started another one

229
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,260
again and again.

230
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,222
He was always building castles in the air.

231
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,392
And a few years ago,

232
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,104
he quit all the business
and started gambling.

233
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,024
Since then, he hardly came home.

234
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,026
And six months ago,

235
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,321
he disappeared, and I couldn't reach him.

236
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,281
So...

237
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,785
I thought he was involved

238
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,412
in something bad

239
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,248
and died.

240
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,171
How did he...

241
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
die?

242
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,014
We're not sure yet,

243
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,143
but he seems to have been murdered.

244
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,487
Does he have anything to do

245
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,074
with Hansu Group?

246
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,076
Hansu Group?

247
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,286
Yes.

248
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
No.

249
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,544
Why would he have anything to do
with such a big company?

250
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,930
"A dead body was found"

251
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,933
"in the house of Jin Myeongchul,
the Seoul mayor candidate"

252
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,769
What's this?

253
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,187
It's an exclusive.

254
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,065
You're doing it again?

255
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,900
I mean, I won't take one side.

256
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,360
I'll keep writing articles.

257
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,445
This is a mere fact.

258
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,947
What's more,

259
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,574
it's a scoop.

260
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,960
What should we do, sir?

261
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,920
Jin Myeongchul is here!

262
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,465
Stop the car.

263
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,935
Mr. Jin.

264
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
Is it true that a dead body was found
in your house?

265
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,565
Is the victim related to you?

266
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,317
Please say something.

267
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,110
Police is investigating this case.

268
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,988
They will find out the truth
about this case.

269
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,490
I don't know who he is

270
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,825
and what's going on

271
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,452
yet.

272
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,833
What if the victim is related

273
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,001
to your family?

274
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,634
If his death

275
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,136
has anything to do with my family,

276
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,306
I'll take the responsibility.

277
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,392
How will you do that?

278
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,115
Honey.

279
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,367
Is he related to you?

280
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,163
What are you thinking?

281
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,667
-Are you suspecting me?
-Just answer my question.

282
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,212
No, I don't know anything.

283
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,131
If that's a lie,

284
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,092
you'll be in trouble.

285
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,636
How dare you suspect me?

286
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,230
Alcohol dependency is a mental disorder.

287
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,440
Get a treatment after the election.

288
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,703
How could a dead body be found
in my front yard?

289
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,206
Who is he?

290
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know yet.

291
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,797
Your mom might have something
to do with this case.

292
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,509
How about you?

293
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,430
You don't, do you?

294
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,102
No.

295
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,355
Mom said she didn't know him, either.

296
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,484
Do you...

297
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,445
trust your mom?

298
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,829
If his death
is related to my family...

299
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,372
That's interesting.

300
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,167
I'll take the responsibility.

301
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,586
What about the one
I asked you before?

302
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
I'm working on it.

303
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,214
Why don't we

304
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,342
reveal it

305
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,509
in this chaotic time?

306
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,095
Good idea.

307
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,605
He was with this man at first.

308
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,497
Who's that man?

309
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,166
This is him. Oh Gwangsik.

310
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,212
Track his location by phone.

311
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,797
Okay.

312
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,219
"Wanted for assault
Oh Gwangsik"

313
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,931
- You're early.
- Yes. It's urgent.

314
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,599
The autopsy is done.

315
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,644
He was strangled

316
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,562
with something like clothesline.

317
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,399
He has various bruises on his body,

318
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,943
ranging from old ones

319
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,403
to recent ones.

320
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,823
The deadly stab was on the abdomen.

321
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,533
It's 2.8 inches deep.

322
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,244
From the width, maybe it was a jackknife.

323
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,205
Fortunately, he had no organ damage.

324
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,958
He could've survived
if he went to the hospital,

325
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,753
but he went somewhere else
and died from excessive bleeding.

326
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,798
Why did he do that?

327
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,260
He was so desperate
that he forgot his pain.

328
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
Oh, I've been stabbed once, too.

329
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,812
Can I take a look?

330
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,276
Where is the wound?

331
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,511
It must've been hurt.

332
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,431
That's my job.

333
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,143
You don't feel pain
when preoccupied with fighting criminals.

334
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,811
When an ambulance arrived,

335
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,480
I realized it was painful.

336
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,275
That's what adrenalin does in our body.

337
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,779
It's good to see a healed wound

338
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,618
after seeing dead bodies every day.

339
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,455
Maybe...

340
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,416
he had something desperate in his mind.

341
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,213
Yes, maybe.

342
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,591
Something like anger

343
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,676
or desire.

344
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,147
"Park Junyoung"

345
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,983
Yes.

346
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,444
We got a suspect.

347
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,279
Oh Gwangsik, a previous assailant.

348
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,406
Go to Taegwan Mountain.

349
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,492
I think the victim was stabbed there.

350
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,333
"Wanted for assault
Oh Gwangsik"

351
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,543
Where is he?

352
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,836
In Room 501.

353
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,714
How long has he been staying?

354
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,466
It's been four days.

355
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,009
Did he pay?

356
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,011
He paid for two days in advance.

357
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,895
I'm a motel staff.

358
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,647
I'm here for your payment.

359
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,983
I'll pay for it when I leave.

360
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,818
Hey, open the door.

361
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,570
My boss wants you to pay it now.

362
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,530
Gosh, you're so annoying.

363
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,699
I told you I'd pay...

364
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,663
What the hell?

365
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,748
Police.

366
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,503
Damn it.

367
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,713
Hey, hey.

368
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,549
That's not a good idea.
There's no descending line.

369
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,259
You might die if you're unlucky.

370
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,343
He's right.

371
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,761
Just come and cooperate.

372
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,349
Okay. Fine.

373
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,019
Oh, look at that!

374
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,026
Look at what?

375
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,322
Oh Gwangsik.

376
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,449
You're arrested for Han Daehoon's murder.

377
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,159
Han Daehoon is dead?

378
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,017
They started
climbing together

379
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,144
at 1:10 a.m.

380
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,236
He came down and got on the car

381
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,530
at 1:55 a.m.

382
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:42,035
"Current time 4:20 p.m."

383
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,682
"Current time 4:40 p.m."

384
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,359
No, it's not me.

385
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,736
You're not what?

386
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,447
Gosh, I mean...

387
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,246
Open your mouth.

388
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,171
Hey, I'm not the one who did it.

389
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,257
You didn't do what?

390
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,341
Just say it.

391
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
Listen.

392
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,012
I...

393
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,890
I got a private loan for gambling,

394
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,933
which is from gangsters.

395
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,269
And Han also borrowed a lot from them.

396
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,354
They said if I could collect Han's debt,

397
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,398
they'd write off my debt.

398
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,233
That's why I hung around with him.

399
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,363
You didn't
hang around with him

400
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,324
but watched and assaulted him.

401
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,701
It was not an assault.

402
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,620
I just beat him lightly.

403
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,872
I had to make him obey me.

404
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,583
But he still disobeyed you,
and you stabbed him in the mountains?

405
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,126
No, it's not that.

406
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,214
Do I have to beat you
to make you tell the truth?

407
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,261
He said he knew a way
to solve everything.

408
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,347
His debt was about 1.2 billion,

409
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,933
and he said
he could pay it at once with this.

410
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,351
That's why I followed him.

411
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,895
- So?
- We climbed up the mountain,

412
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,648
and some strangers suddenly appeared
and attacked Han.

413
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,546
We'll talk again
after the DNA result comes out.

414
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,631
I only peeled apples with that.

415
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,050
I carried it with me to look cool.

416
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,472
He's a petty criminal.

417
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,643
Peeling apples? What a bullshit.

418
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
You got a hunch?

419
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,647
Yes, I did.

420
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,526
The forensic results for Han's phone
are out.

421
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,989
Oh Gwangsik appears most often
on his call list,

422
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,241
but his last call was...

423
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,746
The call
was not answered, though.

424
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,131
"Jin Seungju"

425
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,137
I'll go ask him.

426
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,373
Seungju.

427
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,334
Oh, you're here.

428
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,587
- Busy?
- Yes.

429
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,547
I'm doing all the company work.

430
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,090
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

431
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,304
What's up?

432
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,307
We identified the victim.

433
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,600
Oh.

434
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,317
His name is Han Daehoon.

435
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,325
Do you know him?

436
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,329
I'm not sure.

437
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,957
He looks somewhat familiar.

438
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,627
The last person he tried to call

439
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,630
was you.

440
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,423
Me?

441
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,015
Hold on.

442
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,650
You know,

443
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,403
Father's autobiography
was published last week.

444
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,281
We had a publication party here.
And you didn't attend.

445
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
I think I got his business card that day.

446
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,371
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

447
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,123
- How are you doing?
- Good.

448
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,334
Yes.

449
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,544
Oh.

450
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,379
Thank you for coming.

451
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,922
It's been a long time.

452
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,841
Please take care of Seungju.

453
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,050
Sure.

454
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,301
Have a seat.

455
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,308
If the chairman wins the election,
are you going to be the chairman?

456
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,810
What do you mean?

457
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,021
Don't play dumb with us.

458
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,480
You'll take that position, of course.

459
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,984
Becoming the chairman
of Hansu at 40?

460
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,695
I envy you.
I'm still a general manager.

461
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,572
When will it be my turn?

462
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,116
My old man is still healthier than me.

463
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,828
I'll get a chance
only if he gets sick.

464
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,912
You guys

465
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,497
should watch your mouth.

466
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
Okay?

467
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,472
Mom.

468
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,015
-Should we leave now?
-My son.

469
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,434
Escort her.

470
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm fine.

471
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,572
Hello.

472
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,161
I'm Han Daehoon.

473
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,251
Is that all?

474
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,378
Yes.

475
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,591
By the way, why did he try to call me?

476
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,599
The victim went to Father's house
after being stabbed.

477
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,768
And he called you

478
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,645
right before his death.

479
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,569
If you know something,

480
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,113
please tell me.

481
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,662
Isoo.

482
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,208
Have I ever...

483
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,545
lied to you?

484
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,717
-No.
-Trust me.

485
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,597
He's a total stranger to me.

486
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,339
Oh, Mr. Jin.

487
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,300
How may I help you?

488
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,635
I need copies
of all the security cam footage

489
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,180
for the day of the publication party.

490
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,141
Can I ask why?

491
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,227
Do I have to explain it to you?

492
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,188
Oh, no.

493
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,522
We'll do it right now.

494
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,706
I'm Han Daehoon.

495
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,875
"DH Investment Consulting
Han Daehoon"

496
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,338
Let's talk in private later.

497
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,550
I have something to tell you.

498
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,346
We've met before. Don't you remember me?

499
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,602
You were this tall at that time.

500
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,049
DNA found on the clothesline
didn't match Oh Gwangsik's.

501
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,264
So, there are at least two culprits.

502
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,225
-Yes.
-Should we release Oh Gwangsik?

503
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,476
Let him stay.

504
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,395
He admitted the assault.

505
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,479
Ms. Lee.

506
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,691
Can I talk to you for a minute?

507
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,286
Detective Jin

508
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,498
will be ruled out of this case.

509
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,920
"Damages and dangers caused by Jin Isoo"

510
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,883
"Please reconsider letting him work
as a police officer."

511
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,969
"Damages and dangers caused by Jin Isoo"

512
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,940
The victim might have something to do
with Jin Myeongchul's family.

513
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,651
It's not clear yet.

514
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,029
It'll be too late when it becomes clear.

515
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,157
Ganghyun.

516
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,662
Jin is a member of a conglomerate family
before being a police officer.

517
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,247
He's different.

518
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,209
I told you before

519
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,253
that he could be dangerous.

520
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't get too close to him.

521
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,594
People with huge trauma like that
have cracks in their minds.

522
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,097
They'll break someday.

523
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,685
You know,

524
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,771
since what happened to you,

525
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,315
I'd never trusted my colleagues.

526
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,610
But now I realized

527
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,278
what a colleague means.

528
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,490
I want to trust him.

529
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,867
- You know--
- And captain,

530
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,329
please don't sneak through my drawers.

531
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,672
Dad.

532
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,260
If Jin hadn't saved me,

533
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,138
I would've died there.

534
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,485
"Park Junyoung"

535
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,569
Yes.

536
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,072
An article about Jin is up.

537
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,573
About what?

538
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,727
Did you know
that you're an illegitimate?

539
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,979
Since when?

540
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,439
Your father

541
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,565
was having an affair?

542
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,442
Did your mother
commit suicide?

543
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,069
You don't get along well
with Chairman Jin

544
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,362
due to your mom's death?

545
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,864
How do you feel?

546
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,532
Is your mother's death

547
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,908
related to Jin Myeongchul?

548
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,921
Don't you know what time it is?
Stop making a fuss!

549
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,798
Be quiet!

550
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,182
Jin, get on.

551
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,276
Get on.

552
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,488
Jeez.

553
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:31,989
Go.

554
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,830
Stop shooting.

555
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,918
He's busy investigating.
You guys go home now.

556
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,252
Dismiss!

557
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,337
Hey, ma'am.

558
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,172
Why are you interrupting?

559
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,715
I'm the town master here.

560
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,800
Show me your name card.

561
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
Jeez.

562
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,184
Reporter Go Sangsik.

563
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,937
Are you happy to make money by touching

564
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,480
someone's sore spot?

565
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,235
Go home, everyone.

566
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,237
Call it a day for today.

567
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,780
Go home.

568
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,740
- Dismiss!
- Let's wrap it up.

569
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,116
She's right.

570
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,994
And it's no use staying here anymore.

571
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,079
Let's go.

572
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,555
"Secret behind Jin Isoo's birth"

573
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,847
"Death related to Hansu"

574
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,474
"Jin's birth mother took her own life"

575
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,101
Stop the articles at any cost!

576
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,940
Turn the car.

577
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,283
It'll blow over soon.

578
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,454
Interesting articles will keep coming up.

579
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,876
I'd heard that story
so many times

580
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,461
that I thought I got used to it.

581
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,925
A lot of rumors were flying around
when I was young.

582
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,763
But at some point,

583
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,726
everyone stopped talking about it,
so I thought it had faded away.

584
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,065
They're right.

585
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,030
I'm an illegitimate
from an extramarital relationship.

586
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,161
Right.

587
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,746
And you

588
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,664
are a rich son

589
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,876
who power-trips

590
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,836
and condescends.

591
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,466
But you're actually generous enough

592
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,594
to hold a funeral
for someone without family and friends

593
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,597
and to open an exhibition

594
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,724
for a painter who died unfairly.

595
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,613
They'll need some time to realize
that you're quite a decent person

596
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,323
unlike your appearance.

597
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,827
And

598
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,788
if you make a desperate effort,

599
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,041
you might become a decent cop

600
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,085
some time in the future.

601
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,268
Come here.

602
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,353
"12 Pyeongjin-ro"

603
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,540
You want a drink?

604
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,837
I've always wanted

605
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,797
to teach you how to drink

606
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,675
and share
a drink with you.

607
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,802
Now I've got the opportunity.

608
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,058
What the hell do you want?

609
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,436
It's not like you.

610
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,237
I'm sorry

611
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,364
to make you go through this.

612
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,325
I'm also sorry

613
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,746
to be a nuisance in your election.

614
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,914
I wanted to be a good father.

615
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,875
-That's why I let you in.
-No.

616
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,169
You failed.

617
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,046
Since I became your son,

618
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,008
I've never been happy.

619
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,182
I just wanted

620
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,809
to let you know

621
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
that it was not

622
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,357
just a casual relationship.

623
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,611
I met Seonyoung before Heeja.

624
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,154
We went to the same college--

625
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,031
It's too late to tell me that story.

626
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,953
Teaching how to drink

627
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,914
and sharing a drink?

628
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,249
You dreamed of that bullshit...

629
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,380
while hiding everything from me?

630
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,180
It's way too late.

631
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,266
You really didn't know

632
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,813
that I'd go through this
if you went for a mayor election?

633
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,382
Yes.

634
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,925
Where are you now?

635
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,637
Come to the hotel.
I booked your room.

636
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,849
I'll go to my house.

637
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,568
He's here.

638
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,445
Say something
about the scandal.

639
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,738
How do you feel?

640
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,199
Say a word.

641
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,159
Get out of my way before I get mad.

642
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,868
Ganghyun.

643
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,786
Is Jin okay?

644
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,039
He can't be.

645
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,723
You worked all night?

646
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,020
Who else could solve this case?

647
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,231
It rubbed off on you from Jin?

648
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,484
Mr. Park.

649
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,860
Ms. Lee.

650
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,821
I found the suspect.

651
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,917
This car,

652
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,339
this car...

653
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,935
this third car...

654
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,820
and this car.
These are all the same car.

655
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,988
You saw the driver's face?

656
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,155
Sure.

657
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,163
-You--
-I identified the car owner.

658
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,748
That's what you wanted, right?

659
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,336
Choi Hyeonbae.
He has seven convictions for assault.

660
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,380
Seven convictions for assault?

661
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,715
Hey, Kyungjin.

662
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,883
Great job.

663
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,219
You did it right
for the first time in a year.

664
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,303
-Let's go.
-Okay.

665
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,265
Great job.

666
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,467
A silver spoon
who bragged about himself

667
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,801
was the son of a secret mistress?

668
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,927
Poor punk.

669
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,096
I envied him. How embarrassing.

670
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,849
An illegitimate
pretended to be a rich son.

671
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,310
Silver spoon? Bullshit.
Get lost, punk.

672
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,395
This arrogant bastard
is finally falling.

673
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,899
We'll go get the suspect.

674
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,068
Hey, master key, you're not coming?

675
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,320
455/87 Oseong-ro.

676
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,994
"Delete account"

677
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,913
"Your account was deleted"

678
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,053
Should I disguise myself
as a delivery man?

679
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,767
The master key is here.

680
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,603
You scared me.

681
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,355
Who else could solve this case?

682
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,649
Jeez.

683
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,859
Hearing that once a day is plenty.

684
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,319
Who else said that?

685
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,696
We have one more guy like you in our team.

686
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,532
One more guy as cool as me?

687
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,871
He's out.

688
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,873
- That's him?
- Yes.

689
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,667
Choi Hyeonbae
with seven assault convictions.

690
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,295
Let's get started.
I need some refreshing.

691
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,380
Wait.

692
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,673
Let's follow him

693
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,049
and get the accomplice, too.

694
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,202
Let's just get in.

695
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,328
Okay.

696
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,704
What about me?

697
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,706
Where's my gun?

698
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,790
You can't use one yet.

699
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,418
Two, three,

700
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,670
- Freeze!
- Police.

701
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,550
That punk.

702
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,014
Damn.

703
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,488
Go help Jin.

704
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,061
Jeez.

705
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,753
You may remain silent

706
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,674
and challenge the legality of arrest...

707
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,773
Special thanks
to Jang Hyukjin and Yang Somin

708
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,798
What's going on?
Why were you there?

709
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,007
100 million.

710
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,175
I got something

711
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,718
-on Chairman's wife.
-What?

712
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,637
He knew that I was cheating,

713
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,055
and blackmailed me.

714
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,807
Maybe I could get a share, too.

715
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,600
Choi wants to confess.

716
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,977
We still don't know
who ordered him.

717
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,021
You know who the accomplice is?

718
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,564
I could do everything

719
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,941
to protect my family.

720
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,943
Now, he should know who I am.

721
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,986
Find someone who can finish it clearly.

722
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,613
You ordered his murder, right?

723
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,073
I want the truth.

724
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,076
I can't let that kind of person
be the chairman of Hansu.

725
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,160
You didn't trust me.

726
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,745
You lied to me first.

727
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,039
If your brother
violated the law,

728
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,624
can you arrest him?

729
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,085
I'll find out the truth.

730
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,796
Stay tuned for bonus clip

731
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,037
What's up?

732
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,914
I'm just...

733
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,209
thinking about our old days.

734
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,462
It's been a while.
