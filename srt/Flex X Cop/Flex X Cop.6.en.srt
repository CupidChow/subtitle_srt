00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,138
Hello.

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,060
We're from a photographer's community.
We take your funeral photo for free.

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,691
Sir,

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,402
smile slightly.

11
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,656
Smile.

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,991
Good.

13
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,410
Please get ready.

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,204
One, two.

15
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Sir.

16
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,132
Hello.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,801
Sir.

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,136
Your photo turned out very well.

19
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,851
You like it?

20
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,395
Sir.

21
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,773
We prepared this for you.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,441
Oh.

23
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,276
I don't eat rice cake

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,487
because of indigestion.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,613
Oh, then,

26
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,032
drink this sikhye

27
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,534
and take your time.

28
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,530
They're truly malicious punks.

29
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,328
I told you not to touch it.

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,205
What the hell are you doing?

31
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,167
I told you to show me the file.

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,628
I don't need your file
that says "accidental death" anymore.

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,214
Those three cases
are all robbery and murder cases.

34
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,216
-What?
-The third victim

35
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,844
was killed by nicotine injection.

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,014
The other two victims
also need an autopsy,

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,684
but it's impossible
because they were cremated.

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,935
How dare you...

39
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,942
What's going on here?

40
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,529
You both come to my room.

41
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,590
Pass the case to her.

42
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,927
-What?
-You stabbed your senior's back,

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,511
so make sure to catch them.

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,888
You can go now.

45
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,972
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
Hey.

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
She'll forget her place again.

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,067
Hey, Byungsik.

49
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,153
Before emphasizing your seniority,

50
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,530
do your job properly.

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,200
Shame on you.

52
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,380
Let's focus on our job.

53
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,680
These bastards

54
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,515
will be caught by us.

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,267
But we have no clue.

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,643
No fingerprint was found.

57
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,645
Though it's unlikely
to give us some clue,

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,146
let's dig into the nicotine first.

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,356
Call KCSI

60
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
and reexamine the site.

61
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,733
Hey, guys.

62
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,485
Just chase the great seal.

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,612
Even if it's a real one,

64
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,155
it won't show up

65
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,782
in such a short time.

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,118
Because it's a unique stuff.

67
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,965
If it doesn't show up,

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,925
we should go find it.

69
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,101
I made an appointment.

70
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,394
Just go to the place.

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm Yoon.

72
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,250
You're so famous.

73
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,878
I heard you can find me anything.

74
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,797
From classic cars and unrecorded jewelry

75
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,507
to smuggled cultural properties.

76
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,717
I can find anything.

77
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,260
Only if you pay enough.

78
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,596
You don't have to worry about money.

79
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,889
So,

80
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,474
what do you want?

81
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,975
Oh.

82
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,478
The great seal.

83
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,022
The great seal?

84
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,190
Yes.

85
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,609
My father ran for the mayor's election.

86
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,403
So, I want to prepare a gift for him.

87
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,155
Hm.

88
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,866
You think if he has the seal of the king,

89
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,368
he'll be elected?

90
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,452
Bingo.

91
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,703
That's a good idea.

92
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,510
Nothing special.

93
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
Oh, okay.

94
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
Oh, yes.
That'd be hard. I see. Thanks.

95
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,395
They can't check nicotine.

96
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,814
Nothing found at the scene.

97
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
Nothing in the security cam footage, either.

98
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,528
Why are you guys so weak?

99
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,696
Don't give up. You got this.

100
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,989
We're in trouble.

101
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,408
Is it fun to you?

102
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,243
I'm thinking about beating you.

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,294
What's so funny for them?

104
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,256
They're professional.

105
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,591
Let's search for the similar cases.

106
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,136
Search someone
who majored in photography

107
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,345
or was in a related community

108
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,596
with fraud convictions.

109
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,269
Investigation is such donkey work.

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,854
I thought it was a brain job.

111
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
Hey,

112
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,481
you look into the community

113
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,316
using your brain.

114
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,916
It will take forever this way.

115
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,042
Not forever.

116
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,297
Use your body for investigation rather than your brain.

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,257
She has such good hearing.

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,096
I'm leaving.

119
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,849
I'll get going, too.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,142
Okay.

121
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,852
Good morning.

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,455
"Mr. Yoon"

123
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,583
Mr. Yoon?

124
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,335
You found it?

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,341
Okay.

126
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,181
Why? What's up?

127
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,641
I found the great seal!

128
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,146
It'll be in a secret auction at 2:00 a.m.
Exactly for one billion won.

129
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,315
One billion?

130
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,651
What's the secret auction?
How do they do that?

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,361
I don't know.

132
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,737
I don't know exactly,

133
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,240
but maybe it's only for someone special.

134
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,449
Like me?

135
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,410
How can we prepare
one billion by 2 a.m.?

136
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,246
How about fake money?

137
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,997
It needs a GPS tracker.

138
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,499
Fake money would get caught.

139
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,251
Then, what do we do?

140
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,504
Hey, everyone.

141
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,589
I'm here.

142
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,008
You have one billion at home?

143
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,093
No.

144
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,177
At the bank.

145
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,096
How can you withdraw that money

146
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,639
at this late night?

147
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,225
You still don't know me.

148
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,278
Hello, president.

149
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,904
Sorry to bother you at this late night.

150
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,907
Don't say that.
You're always welcomed, Mr. Jin.

151
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
This way.

152
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,702
Thanks.

153
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,329
Wait here.

154
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,414
Okay.

155
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,211
One billion in cash.

156
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,630
Okay.

157
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,425
Sign here, please.

158
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,509
Okay.

159
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,929
What kind of world

160
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,723
are you living in?

161
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,684
A world where most things are possible.

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,650
Wow, you're amazing.

163
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
It's not a big deal.

164
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,328
-What's up?
-Mr. An.

165
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,122
The stolen stuff is up for auction.

166
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,957
The culprits will be there.

167
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
Come here and get them with me.

168
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,336
I'm busy. Hang up.

169
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,507
-Let's go.
-Okay.

170
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,181
He's here.

171
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,102
Hwang Heetae.

172
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,481
Where were you on September 23rd?

173
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,941
Jeez...

174
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,486
Why do you always suspect me? Damn it.

175
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,906
I came back from Japan yesterday.

176
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,954
It's true.

177
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,335
Goddamn.

178
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,479
-Club?
-The secret auction will be held in here.

179
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,855
Let's go.

180
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,940
Hey, wait.

181
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,693
You can't get in there with that outfit.

182
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,236
You've never been to a club?

183
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
Gosh, wait.

184
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
Hello, ma'am.

185
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,493
Please open your shop now.
I'm around there.

186
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,580
I don't like my girlfriend's outfit.

187
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,671
Mr. Jin.

188
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,964
Hello. Sorry to bother you.

189
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,215
It's okay.

190
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,842
Please come in.

191
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
Here.

192
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,242
We're on duty now.

193
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,577
Yes.

194
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,746
You totally look like a detective on duty.

195
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,998
Your eyes look so scary.

196
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,500
Jeez...

197
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,254
When it's time, that elevator will open.

198
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,465
Behave naturally until then.

199
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,761
It's non-alcoholic.

200
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,272
Now, listen to the music

201
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,107
and get into the rhythm naturally.

202
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,609
Like this.

203
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,986
Two, three.

204
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,494
Drop it, I'll pretend
to be an unhappy client.

205
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,245
You don't know how to dance?

206
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,748
Why haven't you
even learned dancing so far?

207
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,583
Try to do like me.

208
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,002
Stop approaching.

209
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,939
What do you like?

210
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,440
You have any hobbies?

211
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,234
No, I don't.

212
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,029
You don't have anything fun
or exciting

213
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,198
that you want to do on weekends?

214
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,742
For me...

215
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,667
Catching criminals is the most exciting.

216
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,044
I've once caught

217
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,047
a malicious criminal
who had been on the run for three years.

218
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,174
He was a game addict.

219
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,802
So, I pretended
to be a seller of rare items.

220
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,012
I fooled the fraud.

221
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,764
When I handcuffed him,

222
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,015
he was freaked out.

223
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,436
I haven't found anything more exciting.

224
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,734
You should play with me for a while.

225
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,491
It's open.

226
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,624
We're going in.

227
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,486
Mr. Jin.

228
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,615
Is this what you were looking for?

229
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,699
Yes.

230
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,825
It's brilliant.

231
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,454
This is the National Seal
of Korean Empire by Gojong.

232
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,498
The colorfully decorated dragon handle
is beautiful, right?

233
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,459
My father will love it.

234
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,711
He likes to act like a king.

235
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,468
Mr. Park.

236
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,928
Bring the money.

237
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,021
Hey, Mr. Park.

238
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,231
What took you so long?

239
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,067
You tall and sloppy goop.

240
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,110
Put them down there.

241
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,323
Yes, sir.

242
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,532
Oh, and

243
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,242
you want Americano, honey?

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,453
Prepare two Iced Americanos.

245
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,537
I'm thirsty.

246
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,207
What's with those eyes?

247
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,291
Wide open.

248
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,210
Open your eyes widely.

249
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,753
Good.

250
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,214
Okay, go.

252
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,222
That's my new secretary.

253
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,474
I'm still teaching him to be polite.

254
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,559
Jeez, what do I do with him?

255
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,868
You could be beaten by Junyoung someday.

256
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,788
I'm good at fighting.

257
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,248
And I've already kept one beat.

258
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,501
Junyoung has done boxing since he was ten.

259
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,753
He beat everyone in the Police University.

260
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,171
Boxing?

261
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,383
I wish I could show my muscles

262
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,218
inside this shirt.

263
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,220
Hey, wait.

264
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,513
Gosh, this is heavy.

265
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,713
Are they moving?

266
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,173
No, not yet.

267
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,066
Kyungjin, to the back door!

268
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,111
Stop the car!

269
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,823
What's up?

270
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,366
Police.

271
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,202
Please get off for a moment.

272
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,417
What's up?

273
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,669
They left it and ran away.

274
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,633
I knew it, things were going too smoothly.

275
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
Come on.

276
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,956
Did you forget something?

277
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,577
Give it to me.

278
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,153
What do we do now?

279
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,447
I don't know.

280
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,615
We lost one billion.

281
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,618
What? One billion?

282
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,871
Let's say I paid it for the National Seal.

283
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,457
Wow, you're so cool.

284
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,846
I don't know who they are.

285
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,849
The secret auction
is run anonymously.

286
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,976
The sellers and buyers are all anonymous.

287
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,145
We are the ones
who usually send the money,

288
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,397
but they wanted to come pick it up.

289
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,732
You don't know their faces

290
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,067
and numbers?

291
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,528
Then, how did they send the stuff
to the auction?

292
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,287
There's a dark website run secretly.

293
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,830
We upload the information

294
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,499
about what a rich person wants.

295
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,917
And they call us.

296
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,586
They came here with the stuff yesterday,

297
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,214
but they
were covering their faces.

298
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,983
-We should return them. Keep them safe.
-Okay.

299
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,402
Ganghyun.

300
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,696
You failed again?

301
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,031
Your face is saying, "loser."

302
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,370
Kyungjin,

303
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,123
the meaning of "loser" has changed?

304
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,501
Doesn't it mean
a senior who blames his junior

305
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,962
after failing to get the culprit?

306
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,674
Detective Jin,

307
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,092
don't interrupt here.

308
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,510
You know nothing.

309
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,514
Why did such an excellent cop
like my junior

310
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,808
-miss the culprit?
-Yeah, it's sad.

311
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,103
Had her professional senior helped,
she could've caught them.

312
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,187
It's a shame.

313
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,272
Why should I?

314
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,734
I always want you to be embarrassed
after missing the culprit.

315
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,610
What the hell?

316
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,366
The bastards who killed three elderlies
are out there.

317
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,910
Do your feelings matter more than that?

318
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,038
I just don't want to see you

319
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,916
brag yourself and be promoted.

320
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,462
And I can't wait to see.

321
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,549
After I get the culprits and prove
that it's a serial robbery and murder case,

322
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,676
how will you be punished?

323
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,345
Punish? My ass.

324
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
Let's see.

325
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,097
Damn it.

326
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
The truck was a stolen one.

327
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,916
"Vehicle History"

328
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,459
They used a stolen vehicle

329
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,503
and never showed their faces
on the security cam.

330
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,505
They even threw the GPS away and left.

331
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,173
They're very thorough.

332
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,633
It must not be their first time.

333
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,551
No similar cases recorded.

334
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,719
Let's go.

335
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,970
Yes.

336
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,768
Team 2 is scanning
all the robbery convicts in Eunbu-dong.

337
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,062
They can't catch them
in that way.

338
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,231
What if the culprits disappear

339
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,440
after this?

340
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,193
We'll make them appear again.

341
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
Let's set a trap.

342
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,119
Dark website.

343
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,079
We could use the manager.

344
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,789
We tell them what we want--

345
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,207
And I'll find the stuff.

346
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,543
Oh, but we need an elderly.

347
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,003
We can't bring in a normal citizen.

348
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,964
It can be dangerous.

349
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,466
Someone old

350
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,510
who can cope with any situations.

351
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,928
We need someone like that.

352
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,930
Can we find the one?

353
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,475
We don't have much time.

354
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,353
If they stop contacting, it's all over.

355
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,332
I'm home.

356
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,584
You're home?

357
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,254
Jeez, this is tough.

358
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,219
You worked all night?

359
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,897
What's up?

360
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,275
Any problem?

361
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,990
Do you think that's possible?

362
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,329
They've already killed
three people.

363
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,248
We need someone to be their bait.

364
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,751
Someone who is old

365
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,961
and brave enough to face the culprits.

366
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,507
Someone who could fight against them

367
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,300
when an urgent situation occurs.

368
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,931
You're the only one who can do this.

369
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,682
A bait?

370
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
Please help me.

371
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Hey, I'm still young.

372
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,574
Who would think of me as an elderly?

373
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,369
And I'm not a cop now.

374
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,579
I can't do that.

375
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,123
You are a cop.

376
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,959
No, I'm not. I'm a civilian.

377
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,043
I'm not a cop.

378
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,296
I'll get everything right
and let you get back to your job.

379
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,258
No way. It's all over.

380
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,386
Are you not upset about all of these?

381
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,680
You've devoted your whole life.

382
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,140
And you were unfairly convicted
and dismissed.

383
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,810
I'm so upset about it.

384
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,397
To see my respectable father
living like this

385
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,774
makes me so upset.

386
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,162
Hey, do you think my life is that humble?

387
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,941
"Clothing Bin"

388
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,368
"Lee Hyungjun"

389
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,419
Stop, stop. Hands off!

390
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,880
What's up again?

391
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,591
Don't get rid of the evidence.

392
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,093
We'll seize and search soon.

393
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,678
Shit.

394
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,181
It's no use glaring at me. Just calm down.

395
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,849
It's none of your business.

396
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,017
Why not?

397
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,560
I need to catch the bastards.

398
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,645
Okay.

399
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,564
Let's get to the dark web,
the secret site.

400
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,402
If you don't cooperate,

401
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,780
I'll regard you as an accomplice.

402
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,242
Goddamn it.

403
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,120
"A rich person is looking for something."

404
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,705
"Can you find it?"

405
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,589
-Oh, oh. They read it.
-Oh.

406
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,799
-Oh.
-They read it.

407
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,884
Cyber Investigation Unit.

408
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,804
-We'll execute a warrant now.
-Hey, wait.

409
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,182
I'm Jin Isoo from Gangha Police Station.

410
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,813
Oh, the silver spoon. We know who you are.

411
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,773
What are you doing here?

412
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm investigating a serial robbery case.

413
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,986
I need this computer right now.

414
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,071
Take other stuffs first, okay? Hurry up.

415
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,952
Hey, it's my team that reported this place.

416
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,036
Isn't it?

417
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,955
You did what?

418
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,665
Should I

419
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,000
show you my power?

420
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,127
I could call your chief.

421
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,255
Phew, you have five minutes.

422
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,799
Search and seize other stuffs first.

423
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,092
Other stuffs?

424
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
What the...

425
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,053
No.

426
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,264
-Where are you going?
-No, hey!

427
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,348
Jeez...

428
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,268
An elderly is keeping

429
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,978
a Goryeo celadon incense burner.

430
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,146
I told him to sell it

431
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,773
but he wouldn't.

432
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,193
At any cost,

433
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,944
bring this stuff to me.

434
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,620
Gosh.

435
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,538
I'll pay you double.

436
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,623
Two billion won.

437
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,254
Two billion?

438
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,382
If you're not capable,

439
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,884
I'll find another team.

440
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,221
Not capable? Bullshit.

441
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,810
It's almost time.

442
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,735
Hey, unplug it now.

443
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,655
We'll do it.

444
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,739
Okay, it's done!

445
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,074
Unplug it now.

446
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,076
Keep up the good work.

447
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,160
Sorry.

448
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,757
What about your father?

449
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,097
I failed to persuade him.

450
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,479
-Hello.
-Hey.

451
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,772
Is Ganghyun here?

452
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,857
She's upstairs.

453
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,149
Upstairs? Thanks.

454
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,485
Ms. Lee, are you ready?

455
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,112
They took the bait.

456
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,948
What's up?

457
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
What are you--

458
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,617
What?

459
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,204
Found the actor?

460
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,748
What? No one?

461
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,502
Jeez, what do we do?
They took the bait.

462
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,462
They're coming here soon.

463
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,428
Sorry,
but I couldn't find anyone.

464
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,138
Our mission is failed.

465
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,599
You're crazy?

466
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,892
What's with that poor acting?

467
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,351
Why?

468
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,770
What about your mom, then?

469
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,653
You know, I'm supposed
to be an elderly who lives alone.

470
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,530
So, what about your mom?

471
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,324
Oh.

472
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,285
"Hansu Life Insurance"

473
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,870
How about this font?

474
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,246
I like this Gothic font.

475
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,040
Make it larger.

476
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,458
We should make her excited.

477
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,418
-Like this?
-Great.

478
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,296
And what about the destination, sir?

479
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,548
Destination?

480
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,966
Ulleungdo.

481
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
Ulleungdo.

482
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,261
Ulleungdo.

483
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,596
Okay.

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,056
"Free Travel to Ulleungdo"

485
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,140
Perfect.

486
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,026
Great job today.

487
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,110
You, too.

488
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,529
-See you next week.
-See you.

489
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,697
Take care.

490
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,499
What's this?

491
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,671
"Travel voucher"

492
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,548

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my.

495
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,057
Gosh, honey!

496
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,141
My goodness.

497
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,435
Honey.

498
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,104
Yeah?

499
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,188
Honey.

500
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,314
I can't believe this.

501
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,400
Why? What's up?

502
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,859
-Why?
-I won

503
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,944
Yes?

505
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
Wow, really?

506
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,703
What's this?

507
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,413
I can't believe it.

508
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,581
You always wanted to travel to Ulleungdo.

509
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,667
Gosh, hold on. Who am I going with? You?

510
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,669
-You want to go?
-I should work.

511
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,171
You want to go, honey?

512
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,423
No. I'd get seasick.

513
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,466
Go with Auntie.

514
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,552
-Right, I can go with Mijin.
-Good.

515
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,595
Wow, amazing.

516
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,639
Hey, Mijin. It's me.

517
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,725
Let's go to Ulleungdo.

518
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,768
I'll pay for everything.

519
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,354
When? As soon as possible.

520
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,237
Hey, you'll be late.

521
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,530
We can eat well without you.

522
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,407
It's almost done.

523
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,702
Gosh, I'll be late.

524
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,664
-I'm leaving.
-Okay, go.

525
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,584
-Take care.
-Okay.

526
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,003
Did you pack your sneakers
and hiking boots?

527
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,087
Oh, my.

528
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,505
How sloppy.

529
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,590
My sunglasses.

530
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
When that gets cold--

531
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,927
Okay, we'll handle it. Just go.

532
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
-See you.
-Okay.

533
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,722
-Bye.
-Enjoy your trip.

534
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,140
-Call me when you get there.
-Okay.

535
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,224
See you.

536
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,014
It's done?

537
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,935
Why?

538
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,228
Do I look weird?

539
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
You're handsome.

540
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,445
I look just like my father.

541
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,627
Why is this punk

542
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,587
living across from Ganghyun's house?

543
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,713
Good for us.

544
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,841
We can stake out nearby.

545
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,856
-Hey, Isoo.
-Hey.

546
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,940
What's all this?

547
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,024
Have you eaten?

548
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,109
No.

549
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,819
Have some.

550
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,491
Welcome.

551
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,535
What's all this?

552
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,704
We don't know how many days it would be,

553
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,414
and there's nothing to eat here.

554
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,540
Have some.

555
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,083
Can't you just stay quiet--

556
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,170
Okay. It's enough. You can go.

557
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,088
We have to work.

558
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,798
Hey, they're still setting the food.

559
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,425
Are we here for a party?

560
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,594
We're staking out.

561
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,350
At what point

562
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,894
is she upset?

563
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,146
Kyungjin, get me the battery.

564
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,898
Okay.

565
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,774
Jeez.

566
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,490
Isn't that too obvious?

567
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,910
Nobody will notice it.

568
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,830
Whatever.

569
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,916
Excuse me.

570
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,919
Oh, long time no see.

571
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,631
It's me.

572
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,800
Oh, I failed to recognize you.

573
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,219
It's been a while.
How've you been?

574
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,803
Good. How are you?

575
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,183
Thank you for helping us.

576
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm not sure that it'd help.

577
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,606
Keep working.

578
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,745
You've not seen it for a while, right?

579
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,829
No.

580
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,212
I think it's done.

581
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
Yes.

582
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,927
-I'm off.
-Okay.

583
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,553
Good luck.

584
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,676
What about me?

585
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,810
No gun for me?

586
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,229
Do you know how to use it?

587
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,606
Gosh.

588
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,483
I'm a marksman.

589
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,027
My name is--

590
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,945
I know. You're good at everything.

591
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,198
But I'll never give you a gun in this life.

592
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,327
What the...

593
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Okay.

594
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,304
Look at you.

595
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,765
You're enjoying it after getting so mad.

596
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,100
Someone should eat it up anyway.

597
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,602
That tastes better with this.

598
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,355
"chicken sauce"

599
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,739
This is so good. Hey, put it more.

600
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
Junyoung.

601
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,911
Come and have some.

602
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:32,995
I'm fine.

603
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,830
This is really good.

604
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,540
He must be hungry.

605
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,549
Hey.

606
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,051
Eat before sleeping.

607
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,013
Can't believe
I'm cleaning by myself.

608
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,454
Here's kimchi.

609
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,289
Oh, I've never opened that.

610
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,916
Oh, kimchi.

611
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,668
Kimchi is a must with noodle.

612
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,927
Where did you get this?

613
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,804
It's by my mom.

614
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,265
Oh.

615
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,474
It's well done.

616
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,532
Oh.

617
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,868
-Who's that?
-A friend of my mom.

618
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,036
Maybe she came to share
produces from her field.

619
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,331
At this early morning?
She's so diligent.

620
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,168
Junyoung never eats my food,

621
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,961
but he takes a shower in my house.

622
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,838
It's his morning routine.

623
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,048
How do you know that?

624
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,552
Because we're friends.

625
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,555
Not yet?

626
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,153
They're here.

627
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,654
Right. Those two.

628
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,573
-Get ready.
-Okay.

629
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,163
Hello.

630
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,998
We're from a community

631
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,918
that takes your funeral photos for free.

632
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,757
Open the door, please.

633
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,762
Hello, sir.

634
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,138
What did you say?

635
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,557
We take funeral photos for free.

636
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,642
Right.

637
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,352
-For free?
-Yes.

638
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,314
Where do you take it?

639
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,816
Oh, we'll take it in your house.

640
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,777
-Here?
-Right.

641
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,861
Yes.

642
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,988
-Come in.
-Okay.

643
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,601
Oh, you did? Come in.

644
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,478
Okay.

645
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,939
-Sir.
-Yes?

646
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,607
Your house is very nice.

647
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,569
Don't say that.
Living here alone sucks.

648
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,446
When you live alone,
these are all burdens.

649
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,491
-By the way,
-Yes?

650
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,909
I'm still young.

651
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,162
Aren't I way too young
to take a funeral photo?

652
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,039
It's good
to prepare it in advance.

653
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,457
You're getting old anyway.

654
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,002
We take it at home for your convenience.

655
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,296
-Then, should I?
-Yes.

656
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,630
So, where?

657
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,841
Well,

658
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,635
this site looks good.

659
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,845
-Here?
-Yes.

660
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,431
Okay.

661
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,645
We'll set the camera and stuff.

662
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,022
You can sit here and wait.

663
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,858
Oh.

664
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,110
-Setting? Okay.
-Yes.

665
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,486
Okay.

666
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,449
Do I need to get changed? Wear a suit?

667
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,159
No, you're already nice.

668
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,410
-He's right.
-Really?

669
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,661
Yes.

670
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,622
Don't I have to wear a suit?

671
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,582
No, you look very nice now.

672
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,500
Really?

673
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,294
We didn't know what you'd like,

674
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,296
so we prepared various food.

675
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,882
-What's this?
-Rice cake

676
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,175
and delicious sikhye.

677
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,594
Elderlies living alone
can't eat well.

678
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,054
So we prepared some food.

679
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,139
Gosh.

680
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,309
This is made by my mom.

681
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,645
It'll taste really good.

682
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,146
They'll kill him right now.

683
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,443
-Try it.
-Okay.

684
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,070
Yes.

685
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,699
Keep working.

686
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,711
"Funeral Photo Volunteer Community"

687
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,310
What the hell? Jaegeun!

688
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,233
Freeze! Police!

689
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,651
What's that?

690
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,569
-Don't move.
-Stay put.

691
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,363
Drop the syringe.

692
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
Drop it!

693
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,074
What the hell!

694
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,409
Drop the gun.

695
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,496
Drop the gun!

696
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,592
Back off.

697
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,019
Back off!

698
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,775
Hey!

699
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,751
You do it.

700
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,210
I'm exhausted.

701
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,257
Get him up.

702
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,967
Junyoung, get him up. That's it.

703
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,647
Take them.

704
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,983
You bastards.
You're Youngbum, right?

705
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,193
I'm Jaegeun.

706
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,445
-You are? You're Youngbum.
-It hurts.

707
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,529
You're overreacting.

708
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,702
What did you do with that sikhye?

709
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,496
Sikhye?

710
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,914
Oh, that.

711
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,458
I spit it out.

712
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,211
I struggled

713
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,587
not to drink it.

714
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,809
You did a great job.

715
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,521
You, too.

716
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,484
You said you're not a cop.

717
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,986
But you still have that sense.

718
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,199
I have sense?

719
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,872
Let's clean up.

720
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,542
If your mom sees this, she'll kill us.

721
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,960
Hurry up.

722
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,929
Why didn't you all
take off your shoes?

723
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,499
I didn't do anything wrong.

724
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,001
Please go easy on me, okay?

725
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,294
Youngbum did all this.

726
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,795
I didn't do anything.

727
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,505
What the hell? You fucking punk.

728
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,174
Hey, think about it. I didn't do anything.

729
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,551
You handled the syringe.

730
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,635
I did nothing.

731
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,723
Please help me out. I'm so scared.

732
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,480
"We'll report the investigation result
for Eunbu-dong robbery and murder..."

733
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,625
Fine, report it like this.

734
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,297
An, you got a complaint

735
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,634
from the bereaved families.

736
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,469
Get prepared

737
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,012
for a disciplinary committee.

738
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,017
-Mr. An.
-What? Why?

739
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,438
You announce it.

740
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,732
-What?
-Let's say we caught them together.

741
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,278
Why?

742
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,782
It's a bribe.

743
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,159
Later,

744
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,827
you should do me any favor

745
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,704
when I ask you.

746
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,712
It's 142-3, right?

747
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,840
Yes, it's three.

748
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,969
Check it and call me back.

749
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,182
"Yay! I got the culprit! -Jin Isoo-"

750
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,227
Hey!

751
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,747
It's urgent.
Please come quickly.

752
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,417
Come here.

753
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,876
What's up?

754
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,670
This is huge.

755
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,963
What's up?

756
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,132
Barabam.

757
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,009
I worked hard to invite her.

758
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,260
Ms. Han Yura.

759
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,429
She'll be on our movie this time.

760
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,722
Hello.

761
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,223
Oh, hello. I'm your...

762
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,307
I'm your fan.

763
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,892
I've heard so much about you.

764
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,519
Should I call you "CEO Jin?"

765
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,813
-Oh, come on.
-Don't be like that.

766
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,690
Have a seat. Come on. Quickly.

767
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,774
Sit down.

768
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,695
I thought something happened.

769
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,988
Something happened.

770
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,156
We're meeting Ms. Han.

771
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,743
He's a big fan of you,

772
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,244
-so he's shy.
-I'm your fan.

773
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,082
Excuse me for a second.

774
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,625
Yes, of course.

775
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,379
Hey.

776
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,881
Why are you so shy?

777
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,301
I prepared it for you as a surprise
because you're her fan.

778
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,470
Me? You punk.

779
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,596
Jeez.

780
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,722
I'm busy.

781
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,806
Hey.

782
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,558
Have a drink.

783
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,976
I quit alcohol.

784
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,729
It's more generous than before.

785
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,397
Thanks.

786
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,232
You all did a great job.

787
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,525
Let's keep up the good work, Team 1!

788
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,194
Cheers!

789
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,993
Did you see

790
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,495
Mr. An's face?

791
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,246
It looked like shit.

792
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,581
That's exactly right.

793
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,211
We'll report

794
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,545
the investigation result

795
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,672
for Eunbu-dong robbery and murder case.

796
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,342
Violent Crime Investigation Team
in Gangha Station

797
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,260
investigated the case in Eunbu-dong

798
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,554
Why didn't you smash him?

799
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,848
It's no use smashing the senior.

800
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,851
It's better off
getting along well with them.

801
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,311
Jeez.

802
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,562
Jeez.

803
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,481
Jeez.

804
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,858
They killed the victims

805
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,653
and made it look like an accidental death.

806
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,072
Go Youngbum and Park Jaegeun

807
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,365
are under arrest.

808
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,325
After a thorough investigation,

809
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,410
-Good.
-they'll be indicted.

810
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,162
When it's released,

811
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,039
you'll be a superstar.

812
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,125
Going up and up,

813
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,417
and you get to the top!

814
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,546
What do you think?

815
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,798
-Yes, it's--
-He says I'm right.

816
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,049
Right.

817
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,134
Cheers.

818
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,385
Cheers!

819
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,137
Have a drink.

820
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,391
Aren't you joining
the team dinner?

821
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,227
I'll get going.

822
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,311
What?

823
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,688
It was nice to meet you.

824
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,356
See you later.
Good luck to your shooting.

825
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,233
Good luck! I'll send a coffee truck.

826
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,693
I'm paying for this.

827
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,278
Hey.

828
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,697
Coffee truck?

829
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,740
A snack truck will be better.

830
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,289
Why not?

831
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,585
Bro!

832
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,588
Where were you?

833
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,047
I had something urgent.

834
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,132
Sit down.

835
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,467
Why are you eating
in a place like this

836
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,303
after our great success?

837
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,597
I could take you somewhere better.

838
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,681
Isoo.

839
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,892
Here is the best place in this town.

840
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,976
Really?

841
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,896
Isoo.

842
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,772
-Is it rare?
-Yes.

843
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:18,987
This is good.

844
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,322
Have a drink.

845
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,492
Hey, stop, stop.

846
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:25,952
Oh.

847
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,247
Cheers.

848
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,540
Cheers, Team 1!

849
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,168
Cheers!

850
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,794
Junyoung.

851
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,338
Do it.

852
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,465
For Team 1

853
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,091
and Plus One.

854
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,427
-Plus One?
-Hey, make it quick.

855
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,012
Everyone, cheers. Cheers!

856
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,096
Cheers!

857
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,726
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

858
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,478
I'll make it like...

859
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,234
-Bye.
-Bye.

860
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,319
Jin.

861
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:44,990
Great job.

862
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,117
What?

863
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,660
I didn't hear you.

864
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,140
Aren't you busy? Why are you here?

865
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,146
Why did you

866
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,689
move here?

867
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,984
To make you upset.

868
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,361
It seems that I made it.

869
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,156
Move out.

870
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,574
I'll find you a new house.

871
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,660
Why?

872
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,830
You feel uncomfortable
that I'm living here?

873
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,962
Does it remind you
of a woman you kicked out?

874
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,465
My mom, who loved you

875
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,924
but was kicked out

876
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,303
before dying while raising your son alone?

877
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,387
Shut up.

878
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,555
I'll stay here.

879
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,267
You can never change the fact
that this house is mine.

880
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,769
It's yours?

881
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,521
You're using Hansu Group
working as a police officer.

882
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,523
You think it's different?

883
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,276
Whatever you do, you're my son.

884
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,320
-That never changes.
-Yes.

885
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,366
I could never forget it.

886
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,496
Because everyone was saying
I'm an illegitimate of Hansu Group.

887
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,166
So, I'm behaving myself
working hard as a cop.

888
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,544
It'd be helpful for your election.

889
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,298
I'll keep taking advantage of Hansu

890
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,674
for catching criminals.

891
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,636
Think of it as compensation
for you to use me.

892
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,794
Honey, I'm home.

893
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,047
-Come out.
-Why didn't you call me?

894
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,715
Mom is home.

895
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,009
What did you buy?
What's all this?

896
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,261
There were
so many things to buy.

897
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,680
-Yeah?
-Squid, seaweed,

898
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,140
and some other things

899
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,100
plus pollack roe.

900
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,185
You love it.

901
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,311
Oh, gosh.

902
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,396
Great.

903
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,648
Mom, you're home.

904
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,983
Yes.

905
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,484
Oh, pollack roe?

906
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,694
Wow, white pollack roe.

907
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,903
Looks yummy.

908
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,030
Great.
Let's have a nice meal with it.

909
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,241
I knew he would like it.

910
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,909
How was Ulleungdo?

911
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,454
It was absolutely fantastic.

912
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,499
I travelled alone with Mijin

913
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,750
in such a long time.

914
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,961
Great. And you did it for free.

915
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,422
Yes, that's awesome.

916
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,677
What's up with him?

917
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,095
Why?

918
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,763
He looks so happy.

919
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,515
Something good happened to him?

920
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,977
Nothing special.

921
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:11,154
"Donation ceremony for
Gojong's National Seal of Korea"

922
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,781
To get votes from the youth,
a special lecture

923
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,825
or a town hall meeting would be good.

924
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,120
Okay. Pick some good places for it.

925
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,205
Okay.

926
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,957
It was Detective Jin
of Hansu Group.

927
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,792
Reporter Oh Seungyeon is reporting.

928
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,046
Jin Isoo,
the second son of Hansu

929
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,089
arrested the serial murderers

930
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,967
and donated the National Seal of Korea
that was missing.

931
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,220
The National Seal that Jin donated

932
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,305
is a cultural property of Joseon Dynasty

933
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,307
that's been missing since the Korean War.

934
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,267
Since he became a cop

935
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,478
I feel Isoo has changed.

936
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,232
A rich son

An IT legend died like this?

Seo Yukyung, a famous psychiatrist.

965
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,366

01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,201
Said someone would kill him.

967
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,577
What do you mean?

968
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,787
Please stop it.

01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,206
Cho Sunggu blackmailed the president

970
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,874
to charge him for embezzlement.

971
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,501
It'll be a difficult case.

972
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,585
It's interesting.

973
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,753
Hiding in Cho's house.

974
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,296
It's not about the culprit.

975
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,839
You act too dangerously.

976
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,424
-Jin.
-To the 1st floor.

977
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,509

01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,183
Let's just stop it.

982
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,434
Stop what?

983
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,103
It's me who decides to stop or not.

984
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,021
Only I can break our relationship.

985
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,940
Okay, then. You decide.

986
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,233
Ditch me.

987
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,110
-What?
-Please say, "Let's break up."

988
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,904
What a crazy bastard.

989
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,656
Let go.

990
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,700
-Get off of me.
-I knew this.

991
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,745
Hey, there. Stop recording.
