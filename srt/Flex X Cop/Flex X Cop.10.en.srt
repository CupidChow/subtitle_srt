4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,584
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,919
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,806
What's up?

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,267
DNAs detected
from the eight segments

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,352
of the evidence 19, Beak Sanghee's hair,

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,396
match 99.9%.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,493
What brought detectives to my house?

11
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,244
The culprit

12
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,371
was not caught yet?

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,132
I'm a huge fan of you.

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,926
It's an honor.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,432
Watch out for the stairs.

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,314
I thought men with manners are all dead.

17
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,899
That's right.

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,192
I'm a rare item.

19
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,129
 We're here
for an investigation.

20
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,047
Han Yura was murdered.

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
You know it, right?

22
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,430
Detective Lee Ganghyun.

23
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,268
Yes.

24
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
I do.

25
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,563
We talked to some staff,

26
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,606
and they told us about you.

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,026
They said

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,903
you assaulted Han Yura

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,739
- on the day of her death.
- Right.

30
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,242
I beat her.

31
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,537
Why?

32
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,706
Because Yura asked me

33
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
to do that.

34
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,009
Ms. Beak.

35
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,927
Can I get in?

36
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,971
Sure, come on in.

37
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,480
You know, I'll shoot the scene
of being beaten by you next week.

38
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,565
Yes.

39
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,650
I've never been hit in the face, so...

40
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,569
Go easy on you?

41
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,114
Could you beat me just once now?

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,036
She asked you to beat her
to practice for shooting?

43
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,495
Yura's role there

44
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,749
was supposed to stand up to me.

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,627
But that's not easy
when you've never been hit before.

46
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,337
The actor gets scared.

47
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,547
Viewers can tell

48
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,174
that the actor is scared.

49
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,770
She's freaked out.

50
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,397
How was it?

51
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,107
It hurt a lot.

52
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,363
You want it milder
when we shoot it?

53
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,823
No, I know how it feels now.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,617
Beat me like this next week.

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,245
I liked her attitude
as an actor.

56
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,668
Did you suspect me because of that?

57
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,544
Under Yura's nail,

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,214
your DNA was found.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,386
Can you explain that?

60
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,515
Oh, that's...

61
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,022
Would you like some tea?

62
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,357
Ms. Beak.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,025
You got a rash here.

64
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,777
Where?

65
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,445
Here.

66
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,156
Oh, that's due to this lace.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,534
I have an ointment.
Want me to apply some for you?

68
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,827
Sure. Thanks.

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,339
By the way,
did you find the stalker?

70
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
Stalker?

71
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,468
She had a terrible stalker.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,096
She said he even sneaked into her house.

73
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,015
So what did you say?

74
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,017
I told her to catch him by herself.

75
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,020
Not to report him to the police?

76
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,606
We are actresses.

77
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,484
If a stalker breaks into our house,

78
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,779
people would say, "That's her boyfriend,"

79
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,614
and then "She has his baby."

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,867
The rumors grow like a snowball.

81
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,327
So, we can't report it.

82
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,830
Yura was just about to blossom,
so it must've held her back.

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,044
A while ago, my friend,

84
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,671
who was involved
in the making of a movie with me,

85
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,923
was seriously hurt in a car accident.

86
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,718
It was at the beginning,
so the actor was replaced.

87
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,802
After that,

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,471
a rumor went around

89
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,182
that I planned it
because I was jealous of her.

90
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,017
The truth is

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,728
that she was having an affair
with a married man,

92
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,314
and the accident occurred
while they were dating.

93
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,274
She begged me to keep it secret,

94
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,942
so I didn't say anything.

95
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,030
What a loyal friend.

96
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,615
I was too conceited.

97
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,867
I thought that rumor wouldn't hurt me.

98
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,203
But since then,

99
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,288
I didn't get any offers for a while.

100
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,751
That's why images matter for actors.

101
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,836
Just one mistake

102
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
can smash everything.

103
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
So,

104
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,014
are you all clear?

105
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,724
Yes, apparently.

106
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,479
If you want to visit next time,

107
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,647
call me in advance.

108
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,024
An actor

109
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,860
always needs time to prepare.

110
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,994
About that skin tissue,

111
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,747
was it with an ointment?

112
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,836
An ointment for rash...

113
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920
Okay.

114
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,722
"Han Yura was found dead at the movie set"

115
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,227
"Breaking news!
Han Yura was found dead at a movie set"

116
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,105
I heard she power-tripped.

117
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,982
That rumor was true?

118
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,733
Why is Namsu involved?

119
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,569
She's such a nuisance.

120
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,947
It's a crime of passion.

121
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,116
I heard she was a hostess at the bar.

122
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,951
I heard she was rude.

123
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,202
Maybe she asked for it.

124
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,046
Why are you hesitating?

125
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,382
You got the suspect and his fingerprint.

126
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,468
Wrap it up quickly.

127
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,512
The longer it takes,
the more we'll be accused.

128
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,055
I think Kim Younghwan

129
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,891
is not the culprit.

130
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,726
What?

131
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,604
Why?

132
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,355
He has no murder motive.

133
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,358
Then, what about all the evidence?

134
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,320
The motive matters more
in an accidental murder case.

135
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,744
Give them a little more time.

136
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,370
We need to make sure about it.

137
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,463
Two more days.

138
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,131
Wrap it up in two days.

139
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,299
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,851
I didn't help you,

141
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,686
but told my opinion.

142
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,980
I know.

143
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,195
Ms. Lee.

144
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,780
The forensic result is out.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,616
There's a video
that Han Yura watched before death.

146
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,117
What video?

147
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,120
We can't confirm it.
It's stored in the cloud.

148
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,581
Cloud?

149
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,208
Can't we sign in automatically?

150
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,503
-  No.
-  Can't we just get a warrant for it?

151
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,879
We can't get the warrant.

152
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,964
We can't?

153
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,091
They usually don't cooperate.

154
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,842
Even if they do, it'll take long.

155
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,388
What kind of video was that?

156
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,057
Was it about Ha Namsu?

157
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,643
Han Yura was going to
reveal something, right?

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,479
I'll reveal everything.

159
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,275
Let's ask help to the cloud, anyway.

160
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,401
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,194
I'll keep watching

162
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,821
- Ha Namsu.
- Okay.

163
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,198
Jin.

164
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,284
Let's go find out who the stalker is.

165
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,167
Copies from security cams
in the hallway and the entrance.

166
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,252
- Thanks.
- No problem.

167
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,130
Han Yura's father is in her house now.

168
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,767
She's been pretty

169
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,936
since she was young.

170
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,108
So, I was anxious.

171
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
I wanted her to live a normal life.

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,714
I heard the culprit

173
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,758
is the CEO.

174
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,469
We're not sure yet.

175
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,307
Yura had a stalker.

176
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,184
Have you heard of that?

177
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,935
Stalker?

178
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,270
Yes.

179
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,230
Did she have one?

180
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,858
We're still on investigation.

181
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,613
After she became an actor,

182
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,990
I couldn't even see her often.

183
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,451
She always said she was fine,

184
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,120
so I didn't know anything.

185
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,042
"unknown caller"

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,754
I get so many calls from strangers.

187
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,467
People talk thoughtlessly

188
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
about her death.

189
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,935
She also has a lot of fans
who love and support her.

190
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,978
We feel the same way.

191
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,815
We promise

192
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,858
we'll get the culprit.

193
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,613
Okay.

194
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,421
Aren't they pretty?

195
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,464
Now

196
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,924
they can't be given to her.

197
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,101
We heard
that Han Yura had a stalker.

198
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,311
Right.

199
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,023
That was Ha Namsu.

200
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,944
It was Ha

201
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,989
who recommended Yura
for the main character role.

202
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,908
We were grateful for that at first.

203
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,536
But the truth was
that he wanted to date her.

204
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,912
He begged her to date him,

205
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,248
and she rejected him politely,

206
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,542
because she had to continue
working with him.

207
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,544
 Then, he uploaded photos

208
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,129
as if they were a real couple.

209
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,841
Because of that, Ha Namsu's fans

210
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,177
attacked Yura harshly.

211
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,305
Hundreds of mean comments
were left on our website,

212
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,307
and freaking letters were sent to her.

213
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,143
"Now that it's already like this,
just be my girlfriend," Ha said,

214
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,519
adding that he'd announce it.

215
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,105
Every time he was drunk,

216
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,065
he sent her dozens of texts.

217
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,653
We couldn't find them in her cell phone.

218
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
Oh.

219
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,782
That's...

220
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,409
She changed the device.

221
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,495
Oh, here.

222
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
I kept those texts here

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,001
just in case

224
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,796
we need to accuse him.

225
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,631
"List of Ha Namsu's stalking texts"

226
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,299
Yura, what's up?

227
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,467
You're avoiding me?

228
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,802
I don't get it.

229
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
You hate me? Why aren't you replying?

230
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,096
Why do you ignore me?

231
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,181
Why won't you reply?

232
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,766
Reply. Answer my call.

233
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,351
Gosh, what a freaking punk.

234
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,105
Yura wanted to reveal everything.

235
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,190
But...

236
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,192
I stopped her.

237
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,988
Because Yura could get hurt
if it was revealed.

238
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,785
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,457
The shaman said
Yura would encounter misfortune this year,

240
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,709
and she told us to be careful.

241
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,547
I knew the misfortune meant Ha,
but I didn't know Yura would die.

242
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
Who's the shaman?

243
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,928
There's an exorcising scene
in our movie.

244
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,596
She helps us with the scene.

245
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,473
She's an excellent fortune-teller.

246
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,311
Did you

247
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,690
conduct an autopsy for Yura?

248
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
Yes.

249
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,152
Because it's a homicide case.

250
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,292
I'm the CEO here.

251
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,504
I should get going now.

252
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,048
Excuse me.

253
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,223
He's the one

254
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,559
who made Yura an actor.

255
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,561
He's her high school senior.

256
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,480
He cared for her more than her family.

257
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,609
He looked after her like a real brother.

258
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,321
When can we hold her funeral?

259
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,000
"Law Firm HANJUN"

260
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,134
Can Ha Namsu be the culprit?

261
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,970
He's the one with the strongest motive.

262
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,100
He was in the hotel
at 10:25 p.m.

263
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,103
but appeared in the set at 10:30 p.m.?

264
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,023
That's physically impossible.

265
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,776
What if he ordered someone?

266
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,738
If it's revealed,
his life as an actor will be over.

267
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,449
He could've ordered someone
he really trusted.

268
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,826
Why did he have to kill her in the set?

269
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,871
He made it up
to look like manslaughter,

270
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,124
which means that he planned
to frame Kim Younghwan as a culprit.

271
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,126
He has no reason to do that.

272
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,297
If we find the video
that Yura had watched,

273
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,091
we could figure that out.

274
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,721
You're here.

275
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,058
It's the footage
from the security cams in her villa.

276
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,476
Let's check it separately.

277
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,812
- Front door and parking lot.
-  Okay.

278
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,533
Ha Namsu didn't come here.

279
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,243
Yes.

280
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,329
Only Han Yura and her manager were here.

281
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,137
You okay?

282
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,516
You!

283
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,977
Hey.

284
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,898
Why aren't you releasing me? Damn it.

285
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
Hey.

286
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm going crazy!

287
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,404
We're investigating. Just wait.

288
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,199
Wait for what? Shit.

289
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,618
Hey, you.

290
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,288
You want to lock me here forever?

291
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,706
You bastard.

292
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,208
You even remember that?

293
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,462
Since middle school,
I've always protected you, right?

294
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,052
Kim Younghwan.

295
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,014
Come to your senses.

296
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,269
Oh.

297
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,773
Sorry.

298
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,776
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

299
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
I'm going crazy. Sorry.

300
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,737
It's been too harsh for me.

301
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,699
Isoo, please let me get out of here.

302
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,367
I'm going crazy now.

303
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,204
Let me get out. Please save me.

304
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,331
Save me, please.

305
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,665
This is crazy, damn.

306
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
Seungju.

307
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,730
Have you eaten?

308
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,905
I was worried about you.

309
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,617
I'm fine.

310
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,829
No.

311
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,330
I'm not.

312
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,582
I can't even get into my house.

313
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,667
Jeez.

314
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,546
I heard everything.

315
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,257
I was also a child at that time.

316
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,467
I didn't know what happened.

317
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,179
Me, either.

318
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,933
I didn't know anything.

319
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,106
Isoo.

320
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,859
Don't blame Father

321
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,154
too much.

322
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,073
He had no other way.

323
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491
Okay?

324
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,246
He really had no other way?

325
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,626
It's been 25 years.

326
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,089
Has he never got a chance
to tell me the truth?

327
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,926
The most upsetting part is

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,680
that he robbed me of the time

329
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,808
to confront the truth and mourn.

330
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,187
He didn't trust me.

331
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,607
He still thinks

332
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,318
I'm just an immature child.

333
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,616
One of my friends told me

334
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,036
not to try to find out a reason.

335
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
But it's hard.

336
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,956
I want to know...

337
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,628
why she had to kill herself.

338
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,172
Stop thinking about that.

339
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,840
Okay?

340
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,592
You might hurt yourself.

341
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,599
I think it'll take some time.

342
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,689
So...

343
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,733
you want to quit your job?

344
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,859
I'll talk to them.

345
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,985
No.

346
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,696
Without that job,
I won't be able to hold out.

347
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,616
It's also related to Younghwan.

348
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,331
Call me if you ever want to talk.

349
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,377
You know that I'm on your side, right?

350
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,545
Of course, I do.

351
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,548
Let's eat.

352
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,343
Thank you for the meal.

353
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,886
Oh, it's an eel.

354
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,179
Great.

355
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,187
Ha Namsu

356
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,690
is forming a defense counsel.

357
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
Defense counsel?

358
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,858
Yes.

359
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,069
He's preparing
for the trial already?

360
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,155
If Ha Namsu is the culprit...

361
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,533
I'll reveal everything.

362
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,868
-  Yura threatened him.
-  Hey!

363
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,121
So, he made a foolproof alibi--

364
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,706
And ordered someone

365
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,207
to kill her.

366
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,754
We need the video
to make it clear.

367
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,340
Oh, my gosh.

368
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
I got a mail from the cloud.

369
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,553
The manager
is a huge fan of Han Yura.

370
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,857
Two files were opened
on October 14th.

371
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,319
But the files were deleted,
so we can only confirm the file names.

372
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,653
Please catch the culprit.

373
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,656
Only the file names.

374
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,408
It seems to be the date and time.

375
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,160
That's the day of her death.

376
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,996
She was in the middle of shooting
at this time.

377
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,082
Were these sent to her
while she was shooting?

378
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,500
Wait.

379
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,504
It's "hcv."

380
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,131
"hcv."

381
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,592
"hcv"?

382
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,678
Did she have a dog?

383
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,348
Yes, she did.
But it died last year.

384
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
Then...

385
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,184
What's up?

386
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,561
I saw a security cam in Yura's room.

387
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,397
It has a feature
of motion-detected recording.

388
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,690
I had one in my house.

389
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,026
She had a stalker.

390
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,029
She set it for the stalker.

391
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
Let's check the footage of the villa.

392
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,615
- Okay.
- Hallway.

393
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,325
Go to 7:10 p.m.

394
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,123
It's her manager.

395
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,501
She could've asked him
to pick up something.

396
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,255
Let's check one more. October 9th.

397
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,897
October 11th.

398
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,494
Did she have

399
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,996
that many things to pick up?

400
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,457
No. Basically,

401
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,709
managers don't leave the set
while shooting.

402
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,336
I'm sure

403
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,380
that he sneaked into her house.

404
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,550
If Ms. Han found it out...

405
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,720
Could it be the reason
for an accidental murder?

406
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,348
Go to the day of her death.

407
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,225
After 11:00 p.m.

408
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,777
If Woo Sangtae is the culprit,

409
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,238
he went there to remove the evidence.

410
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,531
Evidence...

411
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,907
like SD card or something?

412
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,992
Right.

413
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,453
Let's get him and ask him
what he was doing.

414
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,246
We have no proof yet.

415
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,956
If we summon him now,

416
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,916
it'll only be a vaccination for him.

417
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,502
Vaccination? What do you mean?

418
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,255
If he's released
for lack of evidence,

419
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,799
he'll shield himself
with even more perfect logic.

420
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,634
Jeez, what do we do?

421
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,428
Let's go to Woo Sangtae's house.

422
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,805
Search for an SD card in Han Yura's house.

423
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,307
- Okay.
-  Let's go.

424
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,325
No SD card is here.

425
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,076
I'm sure

426
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,411
it's in here.

427
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,041
I hope the door is open,

428
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,834
but it can't be.

429
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,795
Don't dare to open it by force.

430
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,635
No climbing down a rope.

431
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,848
Jeez.

432
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,521
"Yongjeong Officetel"

433
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,855
God is helping me.

434
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,490
Excuse me.

435
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,244
Huh? You're from...

436
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,080
Hansu Group?

437
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,206
You know who I am.

438
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,208
That will expedite our deal.

439
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,420
Yongjeong Officetel.

440
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll buy the building.

441
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,048
What? That's...

442
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,633
12 billion won.

443
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,427
Really? What a reasonable price.

444
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,887
Great.

445
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,515
I'd like to see the inside.

446
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,975
Let me look around...

447
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,893
Room 301.

448
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,981
- You can look around other vacant rooms--
- Come on.

449
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
You don't know
what rich people usually do.

450
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,986
Rich people

451
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,612
have weird habits.

452
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,906
In my case, I decide to buy a building

453
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,241
by a hunch.

454
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,451
When I was passing by the officetel,

455
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,996
the number 301 suddenly came to my mind.

456
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,457
I felt I could decide whether to buy it

457
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,126
if I saw only that room.

458
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,045
Maybe I can call the tenant and ask him--

459
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,423
Hey, I'm busy now.

460
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,091
I'm leaving abroad soon.

461
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,468
I only have five minutes.

462
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,387
So, what do I do?

463
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,139
You have a master key

464
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,891
that you're keeping
for the building owner.

465
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,645
If I like that room,
12 billion will be sent right away.

466
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,896
Directly.

467
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,279
Please watch out here

468
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,488
for just five minutes.

469
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,590
Gosh. Damn it.

470
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,850
"Marriage Certificate
Woo Sangtae, Han Yura"

471
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,061
What a freaking pervert.

472
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,956
What's all this?

473
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,333
The evidence
that Woo Sangtae is not a manager

474
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,919
but a freaking crazy pervert.

475
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,385
Thank you so much.

476
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,262
So, how about the contract?

477
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,681
I'm not buying it. Too eerie.

478
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,099
Call me with a better deal later.

479
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,183
Okay?

480
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,268
Call you?

481
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,564
I don't have your name card.

482
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,817
Junyoung, check where Woo Sangtae is.

483
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,026
Okay.

484
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,737
I was already watching him.

485
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,350
Police.

486
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,478
Come on in.

487
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,654
The man who just left

488
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,323
told you anything?

489
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,657
Did he

490
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,659
commit something bad?

491
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,580
I could smell a lot of blood.

492
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,376
He asked me how much it costs
for an after-death ceremony.

493
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,298
Ew!

494
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,554
How could a manager do that?

495
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,766
But this can't prove anything.

496
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,393
It just shows
that he was the stalker.

497
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,521
It can't be the evidence of the murder.

498
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,314
We'll need his confession.

499
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,525
But this
can't make him confess.

500
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,320
We should start the shooting again.

501
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,287
Now, everyone's here?

502
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,876
We've gone through
a terrible incident,

503
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,878
but we should continue shooting anyway.

504
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,134
What about Yura's role?

505
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,346
We should finish this movie
using stand-ins.

506
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,890
I think that's our duty.

507
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,141
Right.

508
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,352
We'll restart shooting
from tomorrow.

509
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,771
Oh, there's one more.

510
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,482
I have a favor

511
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,609
to ask you.

512
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,754
- Oh, you're here.
-  Yes.

513
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,007
- Hello, Director.
-  Hello.

514
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,426
You're here, Mr. Woo.

515
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,680
Everyone's here now?

516
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,183
Today,

517
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,395
all of us gathered here

518
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,980
for Ms. Han Yura.

519
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,566
Before we restart the shooting,

520
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,484
I'd like to hold a ceremony for her.

521
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,652
Yura's soul

522
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,571
is still stuck

523
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,656
in here.

524
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,829
It's us

525
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,373
who should help Yura's soul

526
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,209
to leave this world at ease.

527
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,129
Team 1 is working very weirdly

528
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,048
since they got a weird newbie.

529
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,467
Shut up and just watch.

530
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,052
Close your eyes

531
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,349
and call Yura's soul in your mind.

532
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,893
Sincerely...

533
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,272
and desperately...

534
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,776
Very desperately...

535
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,286
I'm resentful.

536
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,497
So resentful.

537
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,542
Why should I die like this?

538
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,797
Why should this young and beautiful youth

539
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,759
disappear like this?

540
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,388
I'm upset.

541
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,223
So upset.

542
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,768
I was a cherished daughter

543
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,104
and a beloved actor.

544
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,024
I trusted him.

545
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,278
That man
I trusted and depended on

546
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,783
killed me.

547
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,668
You mean, that man is here now?

548
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,494
Come here.

549
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,414
I'll listen to all of your story.

550
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,166
Come on.

551
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,544
You shouldn't be here.

552
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,214
Come on and leave with me.

553
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,508
Come here.

554
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,679
I'll resolve your deep sorrow.

555
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,247
Gosh, damn.

556
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,373
Hey, you scared me.

557
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,503
Why? You see something?

558
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,884
No way.

559
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,390
Sangtae.

560
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,936
Sangtae.

561
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,779
Please help me.

562
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,241
- Yura.
-  Help me.

563
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
You okay?

564
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,160
It hurts so much.

565
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,204
Please help me.

566
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,497
Are you okay?

567
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,588
Yura, I'm sorry.

568
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,258
It's all my fault.

569
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,592
Sorry.

570
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,395
Why did you do that to me?

571
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,693
Yura.

572
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,571
I did it because I loved you so much.

573
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,531
Yura, I'm...

574
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,785
Then, why did you do that to me? I...

575
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,831
I love you
more than anyone else in the world.

576
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,772
Yura, you did a great job.

577
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,860
Going straight home, right?

578
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,615
Was it you?

579
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,950
What?

580
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,704
Was it you who sneaked into my house
doing perverted things?

581
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,210
I set a security cam
to see who was doing this.

582
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,087
The cam recorded it all.

583
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,634
Oh, that's...

584
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,718
I'll report you.

585
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,261
Yura, hey.

586
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,138
-  Hey.
- Let go of me.

587
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,015
Yura, wait. Please.

588
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,352
Calm down

589
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,520
and listen to me.

590
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,736
As you know,

591
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,405
we're going to get married anyway.

592
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,868
What are you talking about?

593
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,286
Long time ago,

594
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,330
you told me

595
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,041
that you wanted to get married around 35.

596
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,752
I've already prepared our new house.

597
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,798
I'm just being careful
to prevent romance rumors.

598
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,591
Marriage?

599
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
It's not you
whom I wanted to get married.

600
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,680
What? Yura.

601
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,559
You looked into my eyes
while talking that to me.

602
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,186
You wanted get married to me.

603
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,105
Are you insane?

604
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,273
Hey.

605
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,983
I know you rejected Ha Namsu

606
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,235
because of me.

607
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,196
You...

608
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,698
You're insane.

609
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
Yura. Okay, okay.

610
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,868
You shouldn't lie to me.

611
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,037
Let go of me, you pervert.

612
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,457
Damn.

613
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,585
Why do you betray me? Gosh.

614
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,339
Shit.

615
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,342
I've lived only for you.

616
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,305
It's me who made you an actor.

617
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,313
Why? Why!

618
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,482
Why!

619
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,952
Why...

620
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
Why...

621
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,090
Woo Sangtae.

622
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,220
You're under arrest for Han Yura's murder.

623
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,016
- What?
-  You may testify on your behalf

624
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,226
and challenge
the properness of arrest.

625
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,520
You can remain silent.

626
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,149
Cut!

627
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,275
Scene, okay!

628
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,361
Perfect.

629
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,656
Thanks to your great work,
we finally got the culprit. Cheers!

630
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,870
Wow, it's awesome.

631
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,048
You need help?

632
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,177
No, thanks.

633
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,428
Gosh.

634
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,972
Great acting.
Why don't you become an actor?

635
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,057
Shut up.

636
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,851
How about zombie series?
I'll be your investor.

637
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,187
You were awesome today.

638
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,271
Pow!

639
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,398
Pow!

640
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,316
How did you do with the candle?

641
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,527
-  Candle?
- It went out by itself.

642
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,611
It was not me.

643
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,580
-  I'm leaving now.
-  Hey, wait up.

644
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,343
What about the clothes?

645
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,306
What?

646
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,143
Why did you change her clothes
after killing her?

647
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,894
Oh, that?

648
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,187
It was too dirty.

649
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,443
I had to make her pretty

650
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,445
because it was her last outfit in photos.

651
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,540
Thank you for your hard work today.

652
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,875
Oh, here it is.

653
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,336
By the way,

654
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,173
did Yura really come?

655
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,550
That's not what you're wondering.

656
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,222
I see your eyes full of sorrow.

657
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,438
Well...

658
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,442
Can I meet someone

659
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,611
who died a long time ago?

660
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,113
Aren't you too old
to look for your mom?

661
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,950
Your mom is now free
from the anguish of life.

662
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,621
A soul can't rest in peace
if someone left here keeps calling it.

663
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
Just let her go.

664
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,003
The questions in your mind...

665
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,256
You'll find the answers someday.

666
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,717
It's time for you

667
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,178
to search for candies that you hid away.

668
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,981
"Han Yura's manager was a murderer"

669
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,067
"Han Yura's manager,
a stalking murderer"

670
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,361
"Gangha University Hospital Funeral Hall"

671
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,032
"The deceased, Han Yura"

672
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,286
"We'll remember you forever.
Rest in peace."

673
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,641
This is what Yura had left.

674
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,446
Thank you.

675
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,385
So many fans care about Yura.

676
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,190
Detective.

677
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,776
It must be tough for you.

678
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,571
Can I talk to you for a second?

679
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,291
Heard you found out everything.

680
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,960
Found out what?

681
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,796
The fact that I...

682
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,051
kept hitting on her.

683
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,304
Could you please keep it secret?

684
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,264
My life will be over if it's revealed.

685
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,766
That's none of my business.

686
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,645
Why did a superstar like you

687
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,271
stalk someone?

688
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,068
Was it you who stalked her?

689
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,245
Oh.

690
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,747
Ms. Beak, you're here.

691
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,958
You came a long way.
It must've been tough.

692
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,963
Don't interrupt and just go away.

693
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,384
You didn't explain it properly
when Yura was attacked by your fans?

694
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,595
Goddamn it.

695
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,985
You washed-up bitch. Did you beat me now?

696
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,780
You want me to tell those reporters
why I beat you now?

697
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,206
Hey.

698
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,291
-  I'll pay you back--
- Go ahead.

699
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,378
I'm not sure you can do that, though.

700
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,395
It'll leave a huge blow.

701
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,063
I don't care.

702
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,857
I have no interest in gossips.

703
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,985
Call me if you need a lawyer.

704
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,945
I'll connect you to the best ones.

705
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
You surely are a man of manners.

706
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,329
She's so cool.

707
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,789
Wow.

708
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,211
Got the culprit,
and everything was settled, but...

709
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,337
But?

710
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,007
There's one thing unsolved.

711
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,091
What's that?

712
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,846
It's Kim Younghwan.

713
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,932
Why did he sleep in the set?

714
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,787
Hey, you caught the culprit, right?

715
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,997
Release him.

716
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,249
Open, open it. Please open it.

717
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,334
Right now.

718
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,502
Hey, hurry up.

719
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,639
My dear friend Jin Isoo.
You're the best.

720
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,724
Thank you so much.

721
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,643
By the way, who killed her?

722
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,520
It was Han Yura's manager.

723
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,397
Really? Gosh, that's unexpected.

724
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,982
What a bastard.

725
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,109
Isoo, I'm so proud of you.

726
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,362
You saved my life, dear.

727
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,998
Undergo a proper investigation
and quit drugs.

728
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,088
You punk.

729
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,673
Hey.

730
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,675
Get off of me, damn.

731
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,686
Isoo. Listen.

732
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,814
I have never thought you

733
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,026
as a true friend so far. Not even once.

734
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,031
I stayed with you because you're rich.

735
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,201
Yes.

736
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,828
I know.

737
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,582
I stayed with you because I was lonely.

738
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,837
Make a true friend from now on.

739
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,589
It's not too late.

740
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,843
I realized some people stay with you...

741
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,846
for no reason.

742
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,394
Hold on. Wait. Let go of me.

743
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,062
Isoo.

744
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,731
Hey, you punk!

745
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,316
Isoo!

746
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,371
I'm going home.

747
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,290
You want to go with me

748
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,708
in my dirty old car?

749
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,711
I'll take you to the hotel.

750
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,715
Just get on.

751
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,437
You know, my mom is very nosy,

752
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,898
so I've been tired
since I was young.

753
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,442
We had a guest every day,

754
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,736
and she was always busy

755
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,738
talking on the phone with someone.

756
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,491
So I didn't want to live like her.

757
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,162
But I think
I should be a bit nosy for this time.

758
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,166
When you moved here,

759
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,335
you said it recalled
your good old memories.

760
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,128
Now that I came back here,

761
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,256
it reminds me of the good old memories.

762
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,764
I don't know your mom
and how your childhood was,

763
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,892
but I think you had
a lot of good memories.

764
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,770
And

765
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,564
if you keep staying outside,

766
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,401
it'll be even harder
to put yourself together.

767
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,537
Your car got dirty again.

768
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,957
What's this?

769
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,252
It's sundae, maybe?

770
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,422
My car is suffering

771
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,090
because no one is nagging me.

772
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,469
Let's go

773
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,847
to the house.

774
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,039
I'm going.

775
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,034
It's all done.

776
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,536
Oh, it's a snail.

777
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,206
It's a snail.

778
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,673
You're very good at drawing.

779
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,758
Yes.

780
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,551
Who is so pretty here?

781
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,637
It's you.

782
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,786
Gosh.

783
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,997
What's this mess?

784
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,457
Oh, please.

785
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,334
Why don't you clean up sometimes?

786
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,922
Mom.

787
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,340
Why?

788
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,050
Oh.

789
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,219
Why?

790
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,222
I'm hungry.

791
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,850
Hungry? At this time?

792
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,479
I told you to eat on time.

793
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,106
Can I eat something now?

794
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,067
Sure. Why not?

795
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,195
Come downstairs.
Don't forget to hang it first.

796
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,832
Eating at this time?

797
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,293
She hasn't eaten yet.

798
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,255
Not yet? Jeez, until this late hour?

799
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,799
Don't you need
something to drink?

800
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,592
Okay, I'll drink with you.

801
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,302
Drink? Again?

802
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,012
Jeez.

803
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,222
My gosh.

804
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,557
She's eating now.

805
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,892
She's eating alone.

806
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,977
She needs a drink.

807
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,353
Mom.

808
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,522
- I caught the culprit today.
- You did?

809
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,024
- What a good excuse.
-  Let's celebrate.

810
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,693
Cheers.

811
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,491
-  You got the culprit today?
-  Yes.

812
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,275
Hello.

813
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,652
Detective Lee Ganghyun?

814
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,987
Yes, I'm Lee Ganghyun.

815
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,907
I'm the manager of Oryun Community,

816
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,242
Lee Seongwook.

817
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,578
Do you remember me?

818
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,704
Sure, I do.

819
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,498
I'd like to meet you.

820
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,459
I...

821
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,502
will reveal everything.

822
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,692
Our community
is not that kind of place.

823
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,028
It's for peace of mind.

824
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,034
That incident

825
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,079
was just a coincidence.

826
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,748
Please stop it.

827
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,167
Wait.

828
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,628
Call me anytime

829
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,005
if you ever

830
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,466
change your mind.

831
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,560
"Sudden Death
of Oryun Community manager?"

832
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,729
Special thanks to Kang Sungyeon,
Choi Taejoon, and Lee Naeun

833
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,129
 I saw the tattoo
of the Oryun Community on the body.

834
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,881
 They lure people

835
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,424
and make them their members.

836
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,594
 Many members of the community
committed suicide.

837
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,096
 Dad was digging
into the Oryun Community.

838
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,890
I suspect they set the trap.

839
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,475
He didn't die in the room.

840
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,101
 It's not a suicide.

841
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,229
Who were you reported from?

842
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,189
 His suicide letter looks weird.

843
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,565
Oh, I got it! Awesome!

844
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,526
 Ms. Lee is under probation.

845
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,278
He came to meet the leader
and disappeared.

846
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,446
He was murdered here.

847
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,031
It looks dangerous.

848
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,241
You'd better not do it.

849
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,492
Who needs a cop?

850
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,827
If you want to fight,
I'll be on your side.

851
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,412
Because I trust you.

852
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,498
Stay tuned for bonus clip

853
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:08,253
"A year ago"

854
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,218
Come in.

855
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,012
Chief.

856
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,014
Don't you feel hungry?

857
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,308
Come on in.

858
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,279
Why are you still working?

859
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,744
I just have something to think about.

860
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,706
What's that?

861
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,374
Hey.

862
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,543
Jeez.

863
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,627
Hey, Ms. Lee.

864
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,753
"Mass suicide in a motel"

865
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,589
Mind your own business.

866
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,673
- Okay.
-  Sit down.

867
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,133
"Suicides"

868
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,217
It's getting soggy.

869
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,845
He's here.

870
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,513
Do you plead guilty?
