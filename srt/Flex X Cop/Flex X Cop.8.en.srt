<i>your mom die?</i>

<i>Car accident.</i>

00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,582
<i>I don't even remember it.</i>

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,981
Jeez.

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
What?

17
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,614
Why?

18
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,658
I'll be more careful.

19
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
I was in a hurry at that time.

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,040
By the way, I'm glad about this.

21
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,543
You're worried about me.

22
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,003
I felt you're caring very much about me.

23
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,465
We identified him.

24
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,177
Okay, let's go.

25
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,138
You made it again, bro.

26
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,723
You know, I flew like Spider-Man.

27
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
 Let's go.

28
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,311
-  I'll be back.
-  Okay.

29
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,567
You stay outside.

30
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,986
 When can I do this?

31
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,612
Just stay here.

32
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,032
Hey, I'm--

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,326
Get out of the way.

34
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,750
Kim Dohyung.

35
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,253
You have criminal records.

36
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,130
Three housebreaking charges

37
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
and two car thefts.

38
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,842
Why did you break into Cho Sunggu's house?

39
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,970
To check if there's something to steal.

40
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,722
You broke through the police line

41
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,807
to rob something in the house

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,726
where detectives could come anytime?

43
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,561
They might not come.

44
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,105
Life is timing, isn't it?

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,815
I can do that as well as them.

46
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,860
You need more experience to interrogate.

47
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,279
Do you have any experience?

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,406
I have no chance to experience that.

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
That's right.

50
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>Judging from your records,</i>

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,163
you look just like a petty thief.

52
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,748
But

53
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,125
all the houses and vehicles you targeted

54
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,586
were owned by very rich people.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,254
It must be a coincidence.

56
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,093
Here's our assumption.

57
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,890
You are a problem solver for rich people.

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,684
And today, you were ordered

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,604
to break into Cho Sunggu's house

60
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,105
to find something.

61
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
And...

62
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,317
it's you who killed Cho Sunggu.

63
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,818
You're wrong about that.

64
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,696
Then, it's true
that you were ordered to break in, right?

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,788
Who do you work for?

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,834
No one.

67
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,753
I went there by myself.

68
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,672
You went there to find the USB!

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,801
Who do you work for?

70
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,808
Your VIP is so impatient.

71
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,940
- Answer it.
-  Summon your VIP.

72
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,150
You want to be charged with murder?

73
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,319
You said you didn't kill him.

74
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,280
Pick it up.

75
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
Pick it up.

76
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,534
Pick up, pick up.

77
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,376
Jeez, what're you doing?

78
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,879
Shh.

79
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,135
Hello.

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,595
Yes.

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,181
Okay.

82
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,063
What the hell did you do?

83
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,273
We made an appointment.

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,693
Where?

85
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,403
At the place they met before.

86
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,405
How do we know where it is?

87
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,199
Hey, where's your car?

88
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,285
No. You know where my car is, right?

89
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,369
Yes.

90
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,413
I'll go bring his VIP here.

91
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,665
I'll go with him.

92
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,750
Wait.

93
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,378
Clothes and a cap.

94
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,464
Hey, stand up.

95
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,090
Stand up, quickly.

96
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,968
Ganghyun.

97
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,929
Jin Isoo, that punk...

98
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,639
When are you going to stop him?

99
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,559
Just let him.

100
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,186
I'll report to the chief later.

101
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,817
I can't involve him
in an investigation anymore.

102
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,450
They're here.

103
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,202
Right.

104
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,007
One, two, three.

105
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,096
Who the hell are you?

106
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,223
-  We're...
-  What?

107
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,724
- Turn it off, punk.
- Oh, okay.

108
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,310
- I'm sorry.
-  Sorry.

109
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,230
Hey, hey.

110
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
Here's the hot place.

111
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
Bro.

112
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
Why?

113
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,048
Huh? What the...

114
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,550
Why?

115
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,845
A huge VIP appeared,

116
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,013
- alone to boot.
- Put that away.

117
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,223
-  Wang Jongtae.
- What?

118
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,474
What a rude bastard.

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,059
What the hell are you?

120
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,144
Who we are?

121
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,147
We're detectives.

122
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,579
I'll do it this time.

123
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,416
You need me to deal with that huge VIP.

124
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,461
Will you take all the responsibility
if there's any problem?

125
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,061
Where's your chief?

126
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,480
The chief...

127
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,440
He's sleeping at home.

128
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,650
We aren't planning to wake him up.

129
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,987
I'm not supposed

130
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,492
to be here like this.

131
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,747
You know Kim Dohyung

132
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,166
your errand boy, right?

133
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,335
He's in jail now.

134
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,420
I don't know who he is.

135
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,088
Hey, candidate number one.

136
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,508
Why did you come to meet
someone you don't know

137
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,385
at 11:00 p.m. somewhere
without security cams?

138
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,017
Did you order Kim Dohyung
to search Cho Sunggu's house?

139
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,101
No.

140
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,561
Did you order him

141
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,230
to kill Cho Sunggu?

142
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
No.

143
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,943
We can interrogate you for 48 hours--

144
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,486
Your chief already knows it.

145
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,113
- He won't let you.
-  At least,

146
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,990
we can make it a big issue.

147
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,409
What is between a mayoral candidate

148
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,828
and a criminal
with five previous convictions?

149
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,997
It'll be very attractive to the reporters.

150
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,503
That USB...

151
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,713
we found it.

152
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
Really?

153
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,969
You found it?

154
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,347
That shouldn't be revealed.

155
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,266
You saw it? Did you?

156
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,060
How many of you saw it?
Tell me right now!

157
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,234
Cho Sunggu
blackmailed you, right?

158
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,152
That's why you ordered his murder?

159
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,075
No.

160
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm in the middle of the election.

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,372
Why would I commit such a dangerous crime?

162
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,333
I just...

163
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,295
gave him some money.

164
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,714
You could've just killed him...

165
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,966
secretly.

166
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,386
He said, if he was killed,

167
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,264
the USB would be revealed.

168
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,726
That'd be way more terrible than my death.

169
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,936
Ganghyun!

170
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,697
You punk.

171
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,575
I brought him

172
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,619
to investigate something.

173
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,376
Please come with me, sir.

174
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,527
Now he looks like a real criminal.

175
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,238
They're like special agents.

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,449
Here's his alibi.

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,950
On the day of Cho's death,

178
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,577
Wang Jongtae was in Busan,

179
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,580
and Kim Dohyung was in Jeongseon Casino.

180
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,001
They succeeded twice.

181
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,379
<i>We made it twice.</i>

182
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,463
The victims

183
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,340
are Hong Euna and Wang Jongtae.

184
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,633
And the last one...

185
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,259
<i>Just one more time.</i>

186
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,095
To figure out who it is,

187
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,721
we need to find the USB.

188
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,396
Let's wrap it up for today.

189
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,981
From tomorrow, let's search the places

190
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,358
related to Cho Sunggu.

191
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,151
Let's go.

192
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,842
What's up?

193
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,802
You have something to tell me?

194
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,306
You were in charge...

195
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,311
of the case

196
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,272
of Jin Isoo's mother?

197
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,068
Yes, I was.

198
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,243
What happened?

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,083
After a long-term depression,

200
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
"alprazolam 10mg"

201
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,628
<i>she was found dead
in the bathtub.</i>

202
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>She took sleeping pills.</i>

203
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,093
<i>When she was found,</i>

204
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>a little boy was lying there.</i>

205
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,473
<i>That boy was Jin Isoo.</i>

206
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
That's all.

207
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,858
Jin doesn't remember it.

208
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,153
He thinks it was a car accident.

209
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,824
That's possible.

210
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,246
He couldn't even talk at first.

211
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>They said
he got an aphasia from shock.</i>

212
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,550
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,727
Don't get too close to him.

214
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,859
People with huge trauma like that
have cracks in their minds.

215
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,031
They'll break someday.

216
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,337
"Anniversary of mom's death"

217
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,432
"Detective Jin damaged a citizen's car"

218
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,185
"It endangers the citizens..."

219
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,275
<i>Got something to do today.</i>

220
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,401
<i>I'll be late.</i>

221
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
Any updates?

222
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,491
-  Yes.
-  Cho Sunggu

223
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,702
- used to go to a gym.
- His car was found in the parking lot.

224
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
Okay.

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,330
Let's go. I'll look into his house again.

226
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,160
Ta-da.

227
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,579
I look nice today, right?

228
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,539
Your son is a cop.

229
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,127
I thought it was absurd at first,

230
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,254
but now...

231
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,841
I feel that I'm living a decent life.

232
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,926
"Kim Seonyoung"

233
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,053
I feel like going to work every morning.

234
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,473
Even I am surprised at myself.

235
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
I have three subordinates in my team--

236
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,519
It won't take long.

237
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,188
I'll put this photo and leave.

238
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,564
No, you can't.

239
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,108
Only immediate family can open it.

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,409
<i>Where's the USB?</i>

241
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,661
 <i>Don't worry.</i>

242
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,996
<i>It's somewhere only I can open.</i>

243
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,542
"The deceased, Kim Seonyoung"

244
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
Mom,

245
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,713
I should get going for work.

246
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,674
See you again.

247
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,595
Has anyone in Cho's family
passed away?

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,181
His father passed away
a few years ago.

249
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,683
Why?

250
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,892
I think I know

251
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,560
where the USB is.

252
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,466
"Freedom Memorial Park"

253
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,176
You suddenly found it?

254
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,928
Let's get in first.

255
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,311
This way.

256
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,536
Please excuse us.

257
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,334
"The deceased, Cho Myeonghwan"

258
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,688
How did you find it out?

259
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,482
I've been to my mom

260
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,942
for an anniversary of her death.

261
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,750
It's open?

262
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,669
There are videos.

263
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,589
Let's see Hong Euna's first.

264
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,694
What's wrong with her?

265
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,619
Gosh, that's...

266
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,621
They're what I bought for her.

267
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,378
Let's stop watching.
It's too scary.

268
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,546
Jeez, my heart aches.

269
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
Let's watch Wang Jongtae's.

270
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,431
Huh?

271
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,518
That's not Wang Jongtae.

272
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,455
Damn it.

273
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,175
<i>I'm pretty.</i>

274
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,635
No, you're not.

275
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,305
My gosh, damn. Shit.

276
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,140
That candidate number one. Shit.

277
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,058
- My heart is aching.
-  Wow.

278
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,518
Okay, enough.

279
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,855
Hong Euna

280
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,440
and Wang Jongtae.

281
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,568
Who was next?

282
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,069
Those in the list

283
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,238
are huge figures in politics and business.

284
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,573
Hong is getting married,

285
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,743
and Wang is in the election.
They'd definitely give them money.

286
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,412
But others are too powerful to blackmail.

287
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,665
Someone who'd be damaged the most
when the file is released.

288
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,335
Someone who'd definitely pay them.

289
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,554
Hey, wait for a second.

290
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
Hold on.

291
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,562
How can we figure out

292
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,358
if these people were really blackmailed?

293
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,333
"Crazy Freaking Punk"

294
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,640
Answer it.

295
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,226
Yes, Mother.

296
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,485
Why the hell are you calling?

297
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,904
Hi, Euna. I'm also glad to talk to you.

298
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,407
What's up? Just say it.

299
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,908
I'll kill you if it's nothing.

300
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,493
After you were blackmailed,

301
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,620
did you say anything to Dr. Seo?

302
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,747
You must've gotten mad at her.

303
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,666
Of course, I went there to complain.

304
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,001
<i>Hello.</i>

305
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,878
<i>Security!</i>

306
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,423
So, Dr. Seo knew about this.

307
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,675
You're done?

308
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,884
Hang up, then.

309
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,177
Never call me again.

310
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,262
Wait.

311
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,180
- Just one more thing.
-  What?

312
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,808
What's the special treatment that you got?

313
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,655
Okay.

314
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,408
The culprit is Dr. Seo.

315
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,410
I told you in the first place.

316
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,495
She was aware of this blackmail.

317
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,748
Euna went there and complained about that.

318
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,166
Dr. Seo lied to us.

319
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>He blackmailed your patients.</i>

320
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,254
<i>You didn't know that?</i>

321
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,089
<i>No, not at all.</i>

322
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,468
If she was aware of it--

323
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,971
She must've contacted Cho,
who was in charge of the security program.

324
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,097
As he got caught,

325
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,433
Cho Sunggu blackmailed her
for the last time.

326
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,018
So, Dr. Seo would have been
the most afraid

327
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,978
of the USB being revealed?

328
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,065
These powerful figures
wouldn't let her get away with it.

329
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,317
It'll be more
than just closing the hospital.

330
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,236
She must've got desperate

331
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,072
and killed Cho Sunggu by herself.

332
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,409
You mean, Dr. Seo slashed
Cho Sunggu's neck?

333
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,952
You think that makes sense?

334
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,330
One of these patients was blackmailed

335
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,041
and ordered a professional killer
to murder him.

336
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,460
Hey.

337
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,087
Seo Yukyung is a doctor

338
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
with a lot of experience
in human anatomy.

339
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,341
She could've killed him as a professional.

340
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,844
And she's the only one
who can make Choi Seonu

341
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,137
die from dehydration.

342
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,141
- What?
- The special treatment that she provides

343
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,226
is hypnosis therapy.

344
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,770
In fact, she's well known
for this therapy.

345
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,772
Patients can quit alcohol,
smoking, or gambling

346
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,566
or even change their personality.

347
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,819
Wait.

348
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,862
You mean,

349
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,365
she killed Choi Seonu by hypnotizing him?

350
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,950
Right.

351
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,868
So, she hypnotized him

352
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,495
not to drink water?

353
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,705
I don't know.

354
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,625
But because Choi Seonu trusted her,

355
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,127
she could've done it anyway.

356
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,631
There have been reports of murder cases
involving hypnosis abroad.

357
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,300
I've never heard of that.

358
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,137
Then, how can you explain
why he drank nothing?

359
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,972
How?

360
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's just ignore that bullshit

361
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,268
and think about
how to contact these people.

362
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,603
She's the culprit. We don't need that.

363
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,522
- That's enough.
- Stop it.

364
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,442
Even though she was aware of that,

365
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
she has plenty of reasons

366
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,445
to ignore it.

367
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,072
Jeez, you're driving me crazy.

368
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,617
Oh.

369
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,288
How about Junyoung getting the therapy?

370
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,418
Look. He'd never be hypnotized
at any circumstances.

371
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,502
Bur if he's hypnotized,

372
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,337
it means she's truly capable of it.

373
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,350
- Sounds good.
- What?

374
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,894
Right?

375
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,813
Let's tell her to make Junyoung
do something that he'd never do.

376
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,483
Are you serious?

377
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,775
Let's try it...

378
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,195
just to make sure.

379
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,199
I bet I'll never be hypnotized.

380
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,535
I'll make an appointment.
Let's see.

381
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,687
Wow, Mr. Choi's pasta
in a long time.

382
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,855
It looks delicious.

383
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,191
Wash your hands first.

384
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,277
Oh, right.

385
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,581
If you want to open a restaurant,

386
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,958
I'll be your investor.

387
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,377
I'll travel around the world
after retirement.

388
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,711
I'll go with you.

389
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,837
I decline your offer.

390
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,924
Oh, you made an appointment?

391
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,008
Sure.

392
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,093
What about the job?

393
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,764
A parvenu who is a real estate investor.

394
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh.

395
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,226
A parvenu.

396
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,062
That suits him.

397
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,689
Where's the file about Dr. Seo?

398
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,983
Here it is.

399
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,945
"2020 Doctor of the Year"

400
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,029
 Hm...

401
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,532
"Dr. Seo from Hankook University
Hypnosis therapy"

402
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,075
She's a famous figure indeed.

403
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,496
"Hankook University
Psychiatrist Yoo Myeongsuk"

404
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,011
It's so hopeless.

405
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,679
Look.

406
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,514
Not this.

407
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,977
He doesn't look rich
with any expensive clothes.

408
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,937
Is it because of his face?

409
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,653
Jeez, he took the most expensive one.

410
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,113
At least he has sharp eyes.

411
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,741
How much is this?

412
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,451
You shouldn't touch it.

413
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,535
Take it off.

414
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,288
Oh!

415
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,332
Hey, what's that "Oh"?

416
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,586
Done?

417
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,591
What's this watch?

418
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,384
You got it during the military service?

419
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,595
Sit down.

420
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,972
Hey, sit down, quickly.

421
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,860
You have wax?

422
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,866
I heard you're famous.

423
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,661
You're good

424
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,537
at hypnosis or something?

425
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
Yes.

426
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,374
You know,

427
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,794
I have a bad habit that I want to correct.

428
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,838
I need to test you before we start.

429
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,715
You want to test me?

430
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,634
I've seen a lot of bastards

431
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,260
who lie about their capability.

432
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,807
You're not confident? I'll leave, then.

433
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,891
Let's do it.

434
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,267
Test me.

435
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,727
Okay.

436
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,189
There's a man

437
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,608
whom I hate very much.

438
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,985
Make me adore him

439
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,737
for one day.

440
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,786
You're now

441
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,788
walking at the beach.

442
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,708
Wave comes in...

443
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,252
and it goes out...

444
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,388
<i>Everything is quiet.</i>

445
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,015
<i>Your mind</i>

446
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>is in peace.</i>

447
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,022
<i>Air is warm...</i>

448
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,775
<i>and your feet are light.</i>

449
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,904
<i>In a distance,</i>

450
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,824
<i>he's walking</i>

451
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,369
<i>towards you.</i>

452
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,804
This is a paper published
by Seo Yukyung.

453
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,014
But--

454
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,017
How was it?

455
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,978
Do you have to ask?

456
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,980
The hypnosis? It's a bullshit.

457
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,398
I slept well there, at least.

458
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,817
Gosh, I should've done it.

459
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,824
How did you find that?

460
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,327
Wait. Hold on.

461
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,874
Hankook University

462
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,959
medical school.

463
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,711
The professor's name is?

464
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,962
Okay.

465
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,758
Okay.

466
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,884
Argh. It hurts.

467
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,012
Who put the pencil upside down?

468
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm bleeding. Damn.

469
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,690
It must hurt.

470
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,740
- What the hell?
-  Just a moment.

471
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,040
What's wrong with him?

472
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,543
I think he's hypnotized.

473
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,672
He asked her to make him adore you.

474
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,091
Why did that punk ask that?

475
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,217
Hey, hey.

476
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,971
Stop right there. Wait.

477
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,557
You...

478
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,600
need a treatment first.

479
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
Come on.

480
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,856
- Don't!
-  Come here.

481
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,566
- Stop. Get away.
- Come to me.

482
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,650
Get lost.

483
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,611
-  You okay?
- Yes.

484
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,530
-  You got hurt.
- Hey, hey.

485
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,949
He's acting, right?

486
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,033
I'm fine.

487
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,577
Please don't do anything.

488
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,037
- No.
- I told you, I'm fine. Let go of me.

489
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,666
Don't shoot.

490
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,461
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

491
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,796
How sweet.

492
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,173
Don't move. You'll get hurt.

493
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,842
Hey, stop.

494
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
You owe me one beat, right?

495
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
I'll beat you now.

496
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,723
I mean it.

497
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,022
Damn it.

498
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,649
You want to be beaten by my iron fist?

499
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,776
Isoo.

500
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,029
How could you do this to me?

501
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,408
I was worried about you.

502
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,328
Damn, the hypnosis.

503
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,371
Sorry.

504
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,498
I'll get lost. Okay?

505
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,708
Don't follow me.

506
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,043
- Never.
-  Isoo.

507
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,669
Isoo, where are you going?

508
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,714
No way.

509
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,716
I didn't know he could be that sweet.

510
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,427
He's been hiding it.

511
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,013
It's possible to manipulate people
using hypnosis.

512
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,139
Now, what do we do?

513
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,727
Choi Seonu's murder is hard to be proved.

514
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,396
We should prove it
with Cho Sunggu's case.

515
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,858
Whether she did it by herself
or ordered someone,

516
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,693
we should find the evidence.

517
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,113
"Hankook University Medical School"

518
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,367
Seo Yukyung?

519
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,078
I remember her.

520
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,789
Among all of my students,

521
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,916
she was the best.

522
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,543
Everyone is born

523
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,587
with their own talent.

524
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,464
Dr. Seo's talent

525
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,343
is to read people's mind.

526
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,553
So, I told her

527
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,056
not to major in psychiatry.

528
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,017
Why?

529
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,062
A delusion of being able to see
everything in the human mind,

530
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,981
that self-conceit

531
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,609
could tear down
both the doctor and the patient.

532
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,322
Did she...

533
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,701
cause any trouble?

534
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,911
Oh.

535
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,418
Using hypnosis,

536
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,295
she seems to have killed people.

537
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,089
Oh.

538
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,175
Do you think that's possible?

539
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,434
Hypnosis is not officially-admitted yet,

540
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,561
but it's truly effective.

541
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,438
I also

542
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
sometimes use it to treat my patients.

543
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,611
If she could control
the consciousness of a patient,

544
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,074
it's possible for her to kill the patient.

545
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,755
I saw that award

546
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,258
in Dr. Seo's room.

547
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
Oh.

548
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,055
Right.

549
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,766
She won this award three years ago.

550
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,484
May I...

551
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,419
Be careful.

552
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,547
That's very sharp.

553
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,429
Professor.

554
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,017
Can I ask you a favor?

555
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,108
<i>"Big news! Come out now!"</i>

556
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,317
I'm hungry.

557
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,070
- You want a drink--
- I'll step outside for a minute.

558
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,164
Pork cutlet? All of a sudden?

559
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,041
You said
you didn't have dinner yet, right?

560
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,086
Thank you.

561
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,297
Thank you.

562
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,637
Just try some.

563
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,181
I asked people in this town.

564
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,183
They said this is
the town's favorite place.

565
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,854
How is it?

566
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,689
It's good.

567
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,732
I only go to special places.

568
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,317
I'm a gourmet.

569
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,737
This is good.

570
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,407
I heard other menus are also good.

571
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,491
What is it?

572
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,368
I heard sake dong is also good.

573
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,871
I mean, you have something to tell me.

574
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,331
What's up?

575
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,750
How did you know that?

576
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,837
I met Dr. Seo's academic adviser.

577
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,589
Why?

578
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,508
To figure out more about her.

579
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,470
It's impossible to prove

580
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,098
that Dr. Seo made Choi Seonu die, right?

581
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,143
We can't even put her
on trial with that.

582
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,395
So...

583
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,480
I made a new plan.

584
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:33,983
Hey.

585
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,903
I'm getting anxious again
now that you're making that face.

586
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
Just listen.

587
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
Listen to me while eating.

588
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,576
What's your plan?

589
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,711
Thank you.

590
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,925
I wanted to talk with you

591
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,510
somewhere out of the hospital.

592
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,972
I reserved here
because I heard you love flowers.

593
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,390
Yes.

594
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,892
I like flowers.

595
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,894
Good.

596
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,482
Try it. They make very good food.

597
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,029
Why did you

598
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,531
major in psychiatry?

599
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,037
I wanted to save people.

600
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,500
People who can't tell anyone

601
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,126
about their disease.

602
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,253
Oh.

603
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,629
That's great.

604
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,716
Looking into other people's mind

605
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,385
would not be easy, right?

606
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,387
Right.

607
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,389
It's not easy.

608
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,807
I see.

609
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,185
What do you do in your spare time?

610
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,561
You like travel?

611
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,230
Of course.

612
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,441
I don't have much time for that, though.

613
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,277
Do you like the ocean?

614
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,737
Yes.

615
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,117
I have a seaside villa

616
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,663
on a soft sandy beach.

617
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,583
When I walk along the beach alone,

618
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,630
I feel relaxed.

619
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,509
Wave comes in...

620
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,053
<i>and goes out...</i>

621
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,597
<i>Staring at it...</i>

622
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,526
Professor.

623
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,653
It's been a long time.

624
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,324
How did you...

625
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,750
There's nothing
to worry about.

626
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,377
It's not your fault.

627
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,882
Your mind is in peace...

628
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,969
Your body is light...

629
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,182
Your eyelids are heavy...

630
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,653
Hey.

631
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,032
You, punk.

632
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,034
It's okay. Come in.

633
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,120
Watch your back.

634
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,538
What the hell?

635
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,042
What on earth
did I do yesterday?

636
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,836
You don't remember anything?

637
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,880
No.

638
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,007
I don't remember.

639
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,300
What did I do?

640
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,676
I'll show you.

641
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,387
Just delete it.

642
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,263
<i>Don't move.</i>

643
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,473
<i>Stop.</i>

644
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,682
What the hell?

645
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,393
It's you.

646
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,727
You blew his hand gently.

647
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,895
Delete it right now.

648
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,563
No, I'll watch it when I'm down.

649
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,148
Hey, delete it!

650
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,195
Delete it!

651
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,851
When I heard
that Hong Euna was blackmailed,

652
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,230
I called Cho Sunggu.

653
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,150
<i>Your patients' footage
that you took secretly</i>

654
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,985
<i>is all here with me.</i>

655
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,987
<i>I'll pay as much as you want.</i>

656
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,697
<i>Meet me up.</i>

657
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,241
<i>- I'll go see you at the hospital.
- No.</i>

658
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,493
<i>I'll go to see you.</i>

659
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,478
<i>How could you do this
as a security company staff?</i>

660
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,230
<i>Both my president and I need money.</i>

661
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,732
<i>President?</i>

662
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,196
<i>You mean, Choi Seonu?</i>

663
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,199
<i>It'll be all over if you pay me.</i>

664
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,994
<i>Where's the footage?</i>

665
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,787
<i>That's...</i>

666
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,706
<i>I kept it somewhere safe.</i>

667
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,542
<i>- Don't worry about that.
- Okay, I'll send you the money.</i>

668
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,983
<i>And</i>

669
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,528
I called Choi Seonu.

670
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,697
<i>I had treated him
using hypnosis several times,</i>

671
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,951
<i>so it was easy to hypnotize him.</i>

672
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,495
<i>"Cho Sunggu was murdered."</i>

673
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,456
<i>"You'll be the next target."</i>

674
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,667
<i>"Run away now."</i>

675
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,711
<i>"Hide yourself in the safest place."</i>

676
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,214
<i>"Never go outside."</i>

677
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,800
<i>"They are waiting for you outside"</i>

678
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,218
<i>"to kill you."</i>

679
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,054
<i>He was stuck</i>

680
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,889
<i>without taking medicines,</i>

681
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,892
<i>so his fear grew more and more.</i>

682
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,229
<i>"Never eat anything."</i>

683
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,897
<i>"They poisoned"</i>

684
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,566
<i>"all the food and drinks."</i>

685
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,274
What the hell did you do to me?

686
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,234
We did what you did to your patients.

687
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,528
You've just confessed

688
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,488
everything.

689
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,740
Confessed?

690
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,535
But you don't have any proof.

691
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,329
You really don't remember.

692
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,290
You just said

693
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,083
where the knife is.

694
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,131
Jin Isoo.

695
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,967
- How dare you--
- Yes.

696
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,638
I dare to arrest you.

697
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,514
-  Kyungjin.
- Yes.

698
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,099
Escort her

699
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,684
to the cozy jail.

700
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,672
Here's the warrant.

701
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,802
Oh, here it is.

702
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,933
It's here.

703
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,067
Oh.

704
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,012
It's here.

705
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,933
She kept it because it was
the Doctor of the Year award?

706
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,769
Many criminals keep their murder weapons.

707
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,980
They're anxious
no matter where they throw it away.

708
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,069
Let's go.

709
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,562
Hey, Jin.

710
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,606
Yes?

711
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,274
What's up?

712
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,693
Nothing.

713
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,278
Let's go.

714
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,201
You've cleaned it
with alcohol thoroughly,

715
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,452
but unfortunately,

716
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,704
we found Cho's bloodstain.

717
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,915
A warrant of arrest was issued.

718
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,875
Now you'll be sent to the prison.

719
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,462
Ms. Lee.

720
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,508
Do not trust

721
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,551
Jin Isoo.

722
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,970
He's a time bomb.

723
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,652
I've waited for long.

724
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,782
You still have something
to write about me?

725
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,326
I heard something huge came
to Gangha Police Station.

726
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,287
A USB with secret footage
of powerful figures

727
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,997
in politics and business?

728
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,750
You got it wrong.

729
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,460
Your mole isn't that capable.

730
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,755
I'm writing an article about your mom.

731
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:25,425
If you give me another topic to write,
I won't release that article.

732
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,722
Do the citizens have the right

733
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,183
to know about my mom?

734
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,145
It's a juicy gossip in this time.

735
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:39,898
Juicy gossip?

736
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,779
Now I understand
why people despise reporters so much.

737
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,866
What you're doing is absolute trash.

738
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,618
You might regret it later.

739
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,912
Is it a blackmail?

740
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,084
I can also make you regret.

741
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,355
Isoo.

742
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,025
Seungju.

743
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,985
Are you going somewhere?

744
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,737
What's up all of a sudden?

745
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,572
I have something to tell you.

746
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,990
- Let's get in.
- Oh, wait.

747
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,450
I should get going.

748
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,951
What's up?

749
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,037
Well...

750
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,832
I heard Wang Jongtae
was in the police station.

751
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,042
What happened?

752
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,835
Was he involved in a crime?

753
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,047
No, it's not that.

754
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,632
The approval rate is so close.

755
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,759
That could play an important role for us.

756
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,512
- He was there as a witness.
- That's what I'm asking.

757
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,431
Witness for what?

758
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,515
Hey.

759
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,103
I can't tell you that.

760
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,900
It won't be useful for the election.

761
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,568
Sorry. I should go.

762
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,653
I'll call you later.

763
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,204
<i>This is why I'm concerned</i>

764
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,705
<i>that Jin's behaviors as a cop</i>

765
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,459
<i>might be dangerous for citizens.</i>

766
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,546
<i>Please reconsider your decision
to let him work</i>

767
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,881
<i>as a police officer.</i>

768
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,883
<i>Senior Inspector</i>

769
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,259
<i>Lee Ganghyun.</i>

770
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,854
You're still working?

771
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,898
What a workaholic.

772
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,859
Hey, come to the rooftop.

773
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,368
You know,

774
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,913
the information inside it
is too dangerous.

775
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,916
Two people already approached me.

776
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,211
Did I look that easy to them?

777
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,754
So?

778
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,007
We have plenty of evidence
other than this.

779
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,010
How about destroying it forever?

780
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,058
Ta-da.

781
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,237
I'll tell them I lost it.

782
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,158
You could use it

783
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,660
to disgrace Wang Jongtae.

784
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,662
Hey.

785
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,831
I'm a police officer.

786
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,625
I don't do such a bad thing.

787
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,128
Huh?

788
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,546
You could have a crush on me.

789
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,756
Watch out.

790
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,760
Submit a written apology
for the evidence loss.

791
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,011
Yes, ma'am.

792
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,513
Thank you...

793
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,642
for not kicking me out.

794
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,564
You could've done that in many ways.

795
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,322
I couldn't find my position
no matter where I went.

796
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,160
I thought I didn't belong anywhere.

797
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,916
Now I really want to do it well.

798
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,219
"Situation report for damages
and dangers caused by Jin Isoo"

799
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,360
Mr. Wang.

800
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,528
Mr. Wang.

801
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,988
What?

802
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,698
Jin Isoo.

803
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,201
You're here to blackmail me?

804
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,577
Jeez.

805
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,913
Why is a great man like you
being so nervous?

806
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,458
Okay.

807
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,876
So...

808
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,378
What's up?

809
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,464
We found the USB,

810
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,008
but it's damaged.
There was nothing in it.

811
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,680
So, don't worry about it.

812
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,723
Feel at ease and get a good sleep.

813
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,975
Okay?

814
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,309
You got it?

815
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,603
Good night.

816
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,064
Oh.

817
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,109
I respect your taste.

818
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,652
Good luck.

819
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,746
<i>There's something
about Wang Jongtae,</i>

820
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,456
but Isoo won't talk about it.

821
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,876
Seungju.

822
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,169
Yes, Father.

823
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,129
Do you think

824
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,464
I can beat him

825
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,635
only with a dirty trick like that?

826
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,562
You're disappointing me.

827
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,342
"Dr. Seo"

828
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,737
People come to me

829
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,616
and ask me to save them

830
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,703
from their miserable life.

831
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,959
But after I cure them

832
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,920
and give them a new life,

833
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,131
they ignore me.

834
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,720
They think I have something on them,

835
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,684
and I'll explode it like a bomb
at any time.

836
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,561
So they keep avoiding me.

837
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,111
Is it their instinct?

838
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,616
Maybe they're all aware

839
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,496
that I can explode the bomb again

840
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,042
some time in the future.

841
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,973
Hello.

842
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,266
<i>Mr. Jin Isoo.</i>

843
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,935
Who's calling?

844
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,354
<i>I'm Dr. Seo's attorney.</i>

845
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,523
Dr. Seo

846
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,818
wants to talk to you.

847
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,655
<i>Would you meet her?</i>

848
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,493
"Seoul Detention Center"

849
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,504
You look nice in that outfit.

850
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,176
Why are you laughing?

851
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,011
You missed me?

852
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,431
For the last time,

853
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,975
I'd like to offer you hypnotherapy.

854
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,602
I have nothing to be treated.

855
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,276
Your dream...

856
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,280
about an exhibition hall
with the white wall.

857
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,620
In the big hall,

858
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,581
<i>there is only one picture.</i>

859
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,000
The woman in the picture

860
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,877
is sunken in the water.

861
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,509
How do you know that?

862
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,511
I created that dream.

863
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,265
I don't know what your plan is,

864
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,142
but that's enough.

865
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,311
It was too huge and shocking

866
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,523
for a little boy.

867
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,652
So I

868
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,863
switched your memory into that picture.

869
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,118
What are you talking about?

870
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,203
I mean, I could show you

871
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,541
how your mom died.

872
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,838
You want to see it?

873
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,221
Now,

874
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,099
let's go

875
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,810
into the exhibition hall.

876
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,239
<i>I see</i>

877
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,657
a picture.

878
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,286
Now, find the door.

879
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,330
You should get out.

880
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,457
I can't find

881
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,084
<i>any door.</i>

882
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,254
<i>Not on the wall.</i>

883
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,299
Look at the floor.

884
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,392
Open the door.

885
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,329
Now...

886
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,164
<i>walk</i>

887
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,291
<i>down the stairs.</i>

888
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,335
Special thanks to Ha Yoonkyung

889
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,110
 You fooled me?

890
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,945
I'm asking you!

891
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,071
I protected you.

892
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,740
 You made her die.

893
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,033
What's up?

894
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,537
 Three people have died
in our hotel as of yesterday.

895
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,872
 An actor died.

896
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,956
Han Yura.

897
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,333
 This kind of case

898
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,209
 reveals terrible secrets.

899
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,253
 The suspect is the CEO.

900
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,213
 He was found covered
with blood at the site.

901
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,423
 Help me.

902
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,966
Someone will come pick me up.

903
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,134
Namsu and Yura

904
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,552
- had a fight.
-  Hey.

905
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,846
DNA didn't match.

906
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,806
You didn't get the culprit?

907
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,308
Isoo isn't coming.

908
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,684
He might not come forever.

909
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,728
I don't want to do anything.

910
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,313
Stay tuned for bonus clip
