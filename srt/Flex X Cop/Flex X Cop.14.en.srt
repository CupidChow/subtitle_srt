4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,542
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,883
Let's just get in.

7
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,176
Okay.

8
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,510
What about me?

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,512
Where's my gun?

10
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,722
You can't use one yet.

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,224
Two, three,

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
- Freeze!
- Police.

13
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,190
That punk.

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
Damn.

15
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,220
Jeez.

16
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,080
You

17
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,915
may remain silent

18
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,418
and challenge the legality of arrest...

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
Seungju.

20
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,372
Please take him to the station.

21
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,319
I'll go talk to him first.

22
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,491
Okay.

23
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,668
Mr. Choi Hyeonbae.

24
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,005
Did you kill Han Daehoon?

25
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,008
Han...

26
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,012
Who's Han Daehoon?

27
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,727
It was all recorded.

28
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
On the 25th, Han Daehoon

29
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,398
climbed up
the Taegwan Mountain at 1:10 a.m.

30
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,942
And you

31
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,860
went up there at 1:05 a.m.

32
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,780
Han Daehoon was stabbed

33
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,281
and got back to the car

34
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,491
at 1:55 a.m.

35
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,747
You drove away urgently

36
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,791
at 1:56 a.m.

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,752
Then, you chased his car.

38
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,088
Everything was recorded.

39
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,506
Until you chased him

40
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,092
up to Chairman Jin's house.

41
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,890
Yes, I went to the mountain
on the day.

42
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,767
I like hiking in the early morning.

43
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,018
But

44
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,479
I don't know who this man is.

45
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,233
Was this man

46
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,193
dead?

47
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
You used a jackknife, right?

48
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,535
It was not fatal,
so the victim could run away.

49
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,955
But you were so urgent

50
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,041
that you left the clothesline
you had used to strangle the victim.

51
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,210
We're analyzing it to find your DNA on it.

52
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,505
Wow.

53
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,716
You're working so hard.

54
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,719
By the way,

55
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,015
which place is good in this town?

56
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,099
I'm hungry.

57
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,685
Where should I report when I'm locked up

58
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,936
without being given any food?

59
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,230
Human Right Commission?

60
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,232
Okay, let's eat first.

61
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,651
Maybe it'll take long.

62
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,944
I prefer Korean meal.

63
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,117
No weapon was found yet?

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,452
No.

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
Maybe he has already removed

66
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,872
or hidden it somewhere.

67
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,964
What happened?

68
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
Why were you there?

69
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,805
Why did you meet Choi Hyeonbae?
Who's the kidnapped woman?

70
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,600
You sound like a real cop now.

71
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
Hey.

72
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,064
It's not time to joke.

73
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,775
You could be accused as an accomplice.

74
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,526
Are you

75
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,696
interrogating me now?

76
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,407
Are you?

77
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,416
Han Daehoon.

78
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,796
You know who he is, don't you?

79
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,677
I checked the security cam footage
of the publication party day.

80
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,063
You didn't trust me.

81
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,856
It's you who lied to me first.

82
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,318
Why did you do that?

83
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,204
Please excuse us, sir.

84
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,818
Found out anything?

85
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,070
No.

86
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,655
How about Jin Seungju?

87
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,032
His attorneys are here.

88
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,327
Ganghyun.

89
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,206
Let me show you something.

90
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,525
When did you find it?

91
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,653
Yesterday.

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,074
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

93
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,705
Maybe I wanted him
not to be related to this.

94
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,134
Jin.

95
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,345
Can I trust you?

96
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,644
If your brother violated the law,

97
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,480
can you arrest him?

98
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,944
I don't know.

99
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,154
I still hope

100
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,865
that he has nothing to do with it.

101
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,577
If you can't remain objective as a cop,

102
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
I'll have to rule you out of this case.

103
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,624
I want to know the truth
more than anyone else.

104
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,377
If there's any secret in my family,

105
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,963
it's me who can reveal it.

106
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,593
Lee.

107
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,473
You brought Vice Chairman Jin?

108
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,475
Yes.

109
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,228
He was with the suspect
at the scene.

110
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,604
And in the suspect's car,

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,107
we found a kidnapped woman.

112
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,363
First, we have something
to clarify.

113
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,491
We have confirmed

114
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,411
that none of the client's actions

115
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,788
warrant your emergency arrest charges.

116
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,083
My client is willing to cooperate

117
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,586
with the police investigation,

118
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,588
as he thinks there is a causal relation

119
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,633
between the suspect
and the death occurred in his own house.

120
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,554
Therefore, what my client is saying
from now on

121
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,181
is a statement not as a suspect,

122
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,602
but as a witness.

123
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,979
Please clarify this part first.

124
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,108
Okay, I got it.

125
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,739
When did you first meet
Han Daehoon?

126
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,452
I first met him

127
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,204
at the publication party.

128
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,832
I'm Han Daehoon.

129
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,547
I got his business card,
and we greeted each other.

130
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
Then...

131
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,843
You shouldn't do this to me.

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,428
What're you doing?

133
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,015
I have something to talk to your mom.

134
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,643
Mom, are you okay?

135
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,521
Come on,
don't get the wrong idea.

136
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,065
We know each other.

137
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,028
Get lost now.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,905
Okay?

139
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,953
I learned
that he had died in my house

140
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,457
when Detective Jin visited me.

141
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,293
I see.

142
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,296
So, what did you do?

143
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,964
I asked my mother

144
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,633
who Han Daehoon was.

145
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,010
My mother said

146
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,846
that she had been blackmailed by him.

147
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh.

148
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
Why?

149
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,979
Long time ago,

150
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,401
she had an affair.

151
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,365
Was it Han Daehoon
whom she had an affair with?

152
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
No.

153
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,621
Han Daehoon was her senior in college.

154
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,749
She said she met him by accident
a few years ago.

155
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,918
They used to make contact sometimes.

156
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,002
He seemed

157
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,631
to have kept following me.

158
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,051
He found out that I was having an affair

159
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,429
and started to blackmail me.

160
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,307
I gave him everything he wanted.

161
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,684
But

162
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,020
he contacted me again when your father

163
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,022
ran for the election.

164
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,318
I didn't know what to do.

165
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,487
"unknown caller"

166
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,335
Seungju.

167
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,088
What's up?

168
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,757
He kidnapped Miyeon.

169
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,511
What should I do?

170
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,722
What do I do?

171
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,811
"unknown caller"

172
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,775
That's why I went out to meet him.

173
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,361
You could be in danger.

174
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,575
To protect my family...

175
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,042
I could do everything.

176
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,052
How do the kidnapped woman
and your mother know each other?

177
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,430
I heard they met
while playing golf.

178
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,724
They've been close enough

179
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,768
to go on a trip together recently.

180
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,436
Then, what about Han Daehoon?

181
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,646
Why was he killed?

182
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,565
I don't know.

183
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,485
Can we talk to your mother?

184
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,489
She collapsed and is hospitalized now.

185
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,909
I'll call you when she's ready to talk.

186
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,790
Let's wrap it up here.

187
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,835
My client cooperated with you enough.

188
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,421
Come with me, sir.

189
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,360
Sir.

190
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,790
Wrap it up.

191
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,424
Can we trust him?

192
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll look into it.

193
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,895
Hello.

194
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm attorney Kim Daeyoung.

195
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,568
Where's Mr. Choi Hyeonbae?

196
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,376
The kidnapped victim is Oh Miyeon.

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,212
She's the owner
of five adult establishments in Gangnam.

198
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,923
How is she in the hospital?

199
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,049
She's conscious now.

200
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,177
I'll go talk to her.

201
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,778
Police.

202
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,280
Do you have a cigarette?

203
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,032
I don't smoke.

204
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,870
Tell me what happened.

205
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,501
That jerk, Han Daehoon, blackmailed Heeja.

206
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,505
Why did she tell you about that?

207
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,757
Because it was me

208
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,134
who introduced her boyfriend to her.

209
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,761
Who is he?

210
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,471
You don't need to know that.

211
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,139
He's not in Korea now.

212
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,393
I don't know how Han found it out,

213
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,938
but he blackmailed her,
and she gave him money several times.

214
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,858
But this time, he demanded
a large sum of money from her,

215
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,860
so Heeja was panicked.

216
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,572
Heeja.

217
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,199
Let me handle this.

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,994
How will you do that?

219
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,204
I have my own way.

220
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,044
Don't go too far.
Just let him know his place.

221
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,514
"Han Daehoon"

222
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,808
Hello, sir.

223
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,644
I heard about it from Heeja.

224
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,563
I prepared the money.

225
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,274
Should we meet tomorrow?

226
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,237
And then, something went wrong.

227
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,573
He suddenly died

228
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,118
in her front yard.

229
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,081
What happened?

230
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,666
Why did you kill him?

231
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,377
-Hey.
-What the hell did you do?

232
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
I heard from that jerk.

233
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,262
This is huge.

234
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,350
She's the wife of Chairman of Hansu,
but what we get is only five million?

235
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,021
That's way too little.

236
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,607
I also want a big share.

237
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,691
Are you insane?

238
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,777
She's not the one you can use like that.

239
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,861
Right.

240
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,654
I need a new weapon to use her.

241
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,115
That jerk is already dead.

242
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,952
Now, it's your turn to help me.

243
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,344
Do you know

244
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,221
who the accomplice is?

245
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,766
He's Hyeonbae's brother.

246
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,226
Choi Hyeontae.

247
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,937
It's Choi Hyeontae,

248
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,480
Choi Hyeonbae's brother.

249
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,774
Find Choi Hyeontae.

250
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,858
Okay.

251
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,905
"Suspect of Han's murder
Choi Hyeonbae and an accomplice"

252
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,406
Did Seungju's mom

253
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,826
have a boyfriend?

254
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,829
What?

255
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,832
She's been blackmailed because of that.

256
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,042
Oh.

257
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,752
A few years ago,

258
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,213
that happened.

259
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,009
Did Father know that?

260
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,346
Yes.

261
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,644
Who

262
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,437
was the victim?

263
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,398
It's Han Daehoon.

264
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,400
He blackmailed her.

265
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,321
Do you know him?

266
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,407
No.

267
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,700
Not at all.

268
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,802
Where's Hyeontae now?

269
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,820
What's up?

270
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,165
He left for the Philippines today.

271
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,007
Now,

272
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,509
keep your word.

273
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,885
Of course, I will.

274
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,428
Don't worry.

275
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,978
Choi Hyeonbae wants to confess.

276
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,992
Miyeon asked me

277
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,203
to handle an annoying guy.

278
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,123
Security cams were everywhere,

279
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,457
so we met at dawn

280
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,001
in the mountains.

281
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,970
Mr. Han Daehoon?

282
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,683
I was told to meet you here.

283
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,812
Where's the money?

284
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,691
Over there.

285
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,114
It's time for a reflection.

286
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,034
Think about

287
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,410
what you did wrong.

288
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,925
How much did you get?

289
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,763
How much were you paid for doing this?

290
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,639
You need a receipt or something?

291
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,850
I'll give you 100 million.

292
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,268
What?

293
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,646
Let's work together.

294
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,399
Okay?

295
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,573
I have something

296
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,617
on Chairman's wife

297
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,536
of Hansu Group.

298
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,625
Then I realized

299
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,336
that it was really huge.

300
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,505
It could change my whole life.

301
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,883
And I had no reason to share it with him.

302
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
Because we secured the evidence.

303
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,473
What evidence?

304
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,933
Of course,

305
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,102
the picture of her having an affair.

306
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,668
You definitely got something huge.

307
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,130
Now that we have this,

308
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,676
we don't need you anymore.

309
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,666
Damn it.

310
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,173
Why did Han
go to Jin Myeongchul's house?

311
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,509
I don't know.

312
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,220
Maybe he was pissed off

313
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,847
because I tried to kill him.

314
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,640
Who

315
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,059
was the accomplice?

316
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,311
Don't waste your energy.

317
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,896
He's already left the country.

318
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,022
Choi Hyeontae?

319
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,442
He fled to the Philippines last night.

320
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,486
That's why you delayed your confession?

321
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,654
It's me who stabbed him anyway.

322
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,072
Case...

323
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,575
closed.

324
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,161
Where

325
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,787
is the knife?

326
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,000
Get me a paper.

327
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,377
I'll show you by drawing.

328
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,046
Paper and pen.

329
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,761
Here's my house.

330
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,532
Here it is.

331
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,380
Wrap it up and send it to the prosecution.

332
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,970
Why?

333
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,056
It's Choi Hyeonbae
who stabbed Han Daehoon,

334
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,141
but we still don't know

335
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,977
who ordered him to do this.

336
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,311
So?

337
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,105
Jin Seungju's mother

338
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,274
could have ordered him to do it.

339
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,026
You have any evidence?

340
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,445
No.

341
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,239
You know how to prove it?

342
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,283
No.

343
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,076
Not yet.

344
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,167
Wow, thank you.

345
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,424
Great job today as well.

346
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,634
Team 1, we got this!

347
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,363
Why are you so depressed?

348
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,616
We got the culprit,
and the case was closed.

349
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,410
Cheers!

350
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,505
What a relief.

351
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,011
I was so worried

352
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,431
if your family had anything to do

353
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,892
with this case.

354
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,604
If it did, how could I work with you?

355
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,149
How could I keep investigating it?

356
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,693
But it didn't.

357
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,864
Oh.

358
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,324
My girlfriend.

359
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,410
I forgot that we had a date.

360
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,662
But I'm now--

361
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,788
-You can go.
-Can I?

362
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,164
Oh.

363
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
Thank you.

364
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,169
I'm leaving early today.

365
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,837
Salute.

366
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,221
Goodbye, ma'am.

367
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,520
I should get going, too.

368
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,598
"unknown caller"

369
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,778
It's Jin Seungju.

370
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,407
Was the money transferred?

371
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,700
Okay.

372
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,871
Release the woman
and leave the country.

373
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,957
Stay out of my sight, or you'll die.

374
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,542
Seriously?

375
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,170
A rich son

376
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,172
can commit a murder?

377
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,550
You don't know what I'm capable of,

378
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
do you?

379
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,723
I got it.

380
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,518
Then,

381
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,936
this will be...

382
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,072
Good deal.

383
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,119
- Freeze!
- Police.

384
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,511
Jin Myeongchul!
You cheater! Resign!

385
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,471
Resign!

386
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,363
Come in.

387
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,867
The investigation was over.

388
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,586
"50-year-old man's death case
Investigation Report"

389
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,556
"Victim: Han Daehoon
CEO of DH Investment Consulting"

390
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,073
Why are you here?

391
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,783
How dare you come here?

392
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,619
Now, Seungju should know

393
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,329
who I am.

394
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,376
Heeja.

395
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,878
Let me handle it.

396
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,214
Find someone who can finish it clearly.

397
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,817
It's unhealthy.

398
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,445
Eat something while drinking.

399
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,493
Ganghyun.

400
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,954
Let's dig into it more.

401
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,708
You want to close it like this?

402
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,378
Their statements matched.

403
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,423
You know that Choi and Oh
planned what they were going to say.

404
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,427
And someone
is pulling the wire behind them.

405
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,389
It might be Cho Heeja

406
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,975
and Jin Seungju.

407
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,395
But we don't have any proof yet.

408
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,690
Oh Miyeon won't say anything.

409
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,110
There's nothing we can do
only with a suspicion.

410
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,074
Damn it.

411
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,251
I'm home.

412
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,336
Hey.

413
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,550
Why?

414
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,260
You want a drink?

415
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,477
It's tough, right?

416
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,606
Some cases

417
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,733
aren't clear even after being closed.

418
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,946
Did you have any cases like that?

419
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,781
Sure.

420
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,992
I've worked in this field for 30 years.

421
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,621
I still have some cases
in my mind.

422
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,502
When I failed to get the culprit,

423
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,171
I can't forget the victims, either.

424
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,761
What did you do, then?

425
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,056
I just wait.

426
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,183
Yes.

427
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,856
If a detective doesn't forget the case,
it's never closed.

428
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,611
Don't worry too much.

429
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,573
I asked the Philippines Interpol for aid.

430
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,410
He has assault convictions,
so he'll make trouble in the end.

431
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,580
Just wait until then.

432
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,498
Okay.

433
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,555
Seungju.

434
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,019
Can I get some water?

00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,997
"Criminal Investigation Department"

438
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,842
Why?

439
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,638
Didn't it go well?

440
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
It's not like that.

441
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,060
It went well.

442
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,357
Now, it's all over,

443
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,441
right?

444
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,862
Mom.

445
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,081
Here's the evidence
found in the victim's car.

446
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,707
Oh, okay.

447
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,173
That man, Han Daehoon...

448
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,551
I know who he is.

449
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,722
When I was young,

450
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,603
you used to talk about him
when you were drunk.

451
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,419
You ordered his murder, right?

452
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,760
In the first place,

453
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,722
he approached me with the intention
because my family was rich.

454
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,974
He used you to keep blackmailing me.

455
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,603
I couldn't hold it out anymore.

456
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,647
I did it for you.

457
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,441
I was afraid he would hurt you.

458
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,945
You know you're all that I have.

459
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,003
"Jin Seungju"

460
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:56,482
My son's grown a lot.
He kind of resembles me, huh?

461
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,499
Anyway,

462
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,755
- he's my biological father.
- Your father is Jin Myeongchul!

463
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,593
Then, this one will be...

464
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,768
"It is proved that Han Daehoon
is Jin Seungju's biological father"

465
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,270
Seungju.

466
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,523
My dear son.

467
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,986
It's all over.

468
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,698
Just forget it, okay?

469
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,913
You think it's over?

470
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,291
You do?

471
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,171
It's just the beginning.

472
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,009
Now it all begins.

473
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,595
You and I...

474
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,934
have just opened the gate of hell.

475
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,148
You got it?

476
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,625
Did you know

477
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,752
who the victim was?

478
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,671
Yes.

479
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,799
I heard about him.

480
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,344
Does Isoo know who Han Daehoon is, too?

481
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,762
No.

482
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,682
The case will be closed soon.

483
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,230
I want the truth.

484
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,899
It's a murder case.

485
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,985
If anyone in my family is related to it,

486
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,654
I'll take the responsibility.

487
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,837
We can't let anyone in.

488
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,673
Get out of my way.

489
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,101
What the hell?

490
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,937
Get lost. I'm tired.

491
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,481
-I might throw up seeing you.
-Ms. Cho Heeja.

492
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,318
Did you order Han Daehoon's murder?

493
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,532
-What the hell are you doing?
-Answer me.

494
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,992
Are you insane?

495
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,494
Why would I kill that man?

496
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,788
Because he is Seungju's biological father.

497
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,918
You don't need to answer.

498
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,045
I can tell from your face.

499
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,006
The investigation

500
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,632
will be reopened

501
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,718
to arrest you.

502
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,220
No.

503
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,347
It's not me who ordered it.

504
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,432
I just...

505
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,477
told Miyeon that I was suffering.

506
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,314
I know the three of you
planned what to say.

507
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,690
I...

508
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,777
will find out the truth.

509
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,529
You're also part of our family.

510
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
If it's revealed,

511
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,700
our family will be ruined!

512
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,370
Was I part of your family?

513
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,250
Seungju...

514
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,670
What about Seungju?

515
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,132
If everything is revealed,

516
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,219
what will happen to Seungju?

517
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,934
I know you hate me,

518
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,853
but you don't hate Seungju.

519
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,025
You know how much he cares about you.

520
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,240
For Seungju,

521
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,493
please keep it secret.

522
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,621
I...

523
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,289
am begging you.

524
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,417
Please. I'm begging you.

525
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,337
Keep it secret, please.

526
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,610
You could be in danger.

527
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,865
To protect my family...

528
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,207
I could do everything.

529
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,999
What's up?

530
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,876
I'm just...

531
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,004
thinking about our old days.

532
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,423
It's been a while.

533
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,802
I confirmed

534
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,306
that a lot of money was transferred abroad
from Seungju's account.

535
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,894
Han is his biological father.

536
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,189
You don't think he ordered Han's murder,

537
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,982
do you?

538
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,401
Whoever ordered the murder,

539
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,236
Seungju already knew it

540
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,946
but just covered it.

541
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,741
What are you going to do?

542
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,326
I'll make him make up for it.

543
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,955
I can't let that kind of person
be the chairman of Hansu.

544
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,311
Jin.

545
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,607
You know I trust you, right?

546
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,696
Yes.

547
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,202
It's not because you saved my life

548
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,537
or you are helpful

549
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,539
for our investigation.

550
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,877
It's because...

551
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,754
you are a person

552
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,634
who does the right thing.

553
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,847
So,

554
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,809
if you know anything about this case,

555
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,521
tell me.

556
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,490
I have something to tell you.

557
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,287
Here.

558
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,424
"Letter of Resignation"

559
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,593
It's not fun anymore.

560
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,345
So, I want to quit.

561
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,436
You said

562
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,355
here's where you should be,

563
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,652
and you wanted to be a good cop.

564
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,406
You got it wrong.

565
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,910
I'm not the one

566
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,872
who can become a good cop.

567
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,466
Thanks for everything.

568
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,599
Prepare a press conference.

569
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,619
Meanwhile,

570
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,371
I've caused our citizens

571
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,457
so much anxiety.
I'm sorry to worry you.

572
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,086
As of today,

573
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,797
I am resigning from the candidacy

574
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,340
for Seoul mayor.

575
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,596
Does this sudden resignation

576
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,183
have anything to do
with the dead body found in your house?

577
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,730
Do you admit the fact
that you have an illegitimate?

578
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,402
Did you think you
could hide your scandal from the voters?

579
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,612
Why did Ms. Kim commit suicide?

580
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,072
Is it related to Kim's death?

581
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,240
Enough.

582
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,582
Everything

583
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,877
is my fault.

584
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,090
Please...

585
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,845
stop damaging

586
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,808
the honor

587
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,227
of the deceased.

588
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,018
"Kim Seonyoung"

589
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,690
The questions in your mind...

590
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,152
You'll find the answers someday.

591
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,531
It's time for you
to search for candies that you hid away.

592
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,522
Mom, what's that?

593
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,150
Oh, this is my medicine.

594
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,319
Are you sick?

595
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,404
No, I'm not.

596
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,740
This is for people who can't sleep well.

597
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,950
You shouldn't take it.

598
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,203
Why?

599
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,788
If you take it too much, you could die.

600
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,249
So, never touch it.

601
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,257
You must be hungry.

602
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,467
Wait for a minute.

603
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,418
Isoo.

604
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,169
Did you take my medicine bottle?

605
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,008
I told you not to touch it.

606
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,010
Where is it?

607
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,762
I threw it away.

608
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,848
What?

609
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,891
I threw it away.

610
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,146
You said
that you could die if you take it.

611
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,773
Why do you take that?

612
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,198
Take this from today.

613
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,205
Doctor Jin Isoo.

614
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,665
Patient Kim Seonyoung.

615
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,459
Take one pill a day.

616
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,045
If you take it too much,
you'll get a cavity.

617
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,965
Wow, a great doctor gave me
good medicine.

618
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,843
I'll take this from today.

619
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,428
It looks yummy.

620
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,390
Thank you, sweetie.

621
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,488
She had suffered
from depression.

622
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,657
It was a sleeping pill overdose.

623
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,892
"Date of preparation: October 10th, 1998"

624
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,395
"Kim Seonyoung
October 10th, 1998"

625
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,620
Isoo.

626
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,789
You want a drink?

627
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,216
Why did you remove my memory?

628
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,890
What was the reason
you removed my memory?

629
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,567
As I told you before,

630
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,651
you were shocked--

631
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,945
Was there anything
that I shouldn't remember?

632
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,452
Mom didn't have sleeping pills.

633
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,207
She died from a sleeping pill overdose,

634
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,628
but she had no sleeping pill.

635
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,213
What?

636
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,715
What do you mean?

637
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,593
I hid it away from her.

638
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,309
Mom...

639
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,439
didn't killed herself, right?

640
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,862
What did you do...

641
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,201
to my mom?

642
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,424
Special thanks to Hong Seojun

643
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,741
It seems
that he committed suicide.

644
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,908
It's all your fault.

645
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,869
You killed my husband.

646
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,496
Sleeping pills
were found in the bottle.

647
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,749
You met him, right?
What did you talk about?

648
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,916
It's weird.

649
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,169
Someone might have poisoned his liquor.

650
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,254
He wanted to revise his will.

651
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,049
Someone visited us,
but I'm not sure who it was.

652
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,217
Both could be murder cases?

653
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,470
Chairman was preparing to divorce.

654
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,430
His wife found it out.

655
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,099
She could've killed my mom.

656
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,560
I'll be appointed
as Chairman soon.

657
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,062
I'll get the culprit.

658
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,146
I remember.

659
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,814
Whatever happens to me,

660
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,149
I'll have to do it.

661
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,903
Stay tuned for bonus clip

662
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,288
Long time no see.

663
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,835
I have a favor.

664
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,883
I need to restore my memory

665
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,886
of the day of my mom's death.

666
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,181
Why should I do you a favor?

667
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,771
Because the footage
that you care about very much

668
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,023
is still in the evidence room,

669
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,361
and I might leak it by mistake.

670
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,921
Well...

671
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,507
Now,

672
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,511
let's walk

673
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,139
deeper into your memories.

674
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,138
