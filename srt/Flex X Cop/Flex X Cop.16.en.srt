4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,542
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

5
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,049
My mom's death was not suicide.

7
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,800
She had no sleeping pill.

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,677
I hid it away from her.

9
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,555
There was nothing left

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,016
around the chairman's body, either.

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,101
Someone could've put the pills

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,311
into his liquor.

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,855
You mean, both cases

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,232
could be homicide cases?

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,526
Someone visited my house
on that day,

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,987
but I don't remember who it was.

17
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,408
Jin Seungju?

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,247
It was Cho Heeja.

19
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,096
We have no clue

20
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,098
but only suspicion.

21
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,433
Is there no way to catch them?

22
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,726
What do you mean?

23
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,278
There's no way to catch them?

24
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,034
At 1:00 a.m.,

25
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,454
a car left the house,

26
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,040
but we can't identify the driver.

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,794
There's no security cam
around the villa,

28
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,003
and the dashcam

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,214
has no memory card.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,301
So?

31
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,762
Who's the culprit?

32
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,562
You must have a suspect
even if there's no evidence.

33
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,605
We think

34
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,068
it's Jin Seungju.

35
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,865
What?

36
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,408
For the chairman's position--

37
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,201
That's what Cho Heeja wanted!

38
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,289
She was in the house on that day.

39
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,748
It could be her who drove the car.

40
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,125
She had sleeping pills, too.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,003
Cho Heeja has a driver's license,

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,547
but she can't drive.

43
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,848
You don't know about Seungju.

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,976
He was the only one

45
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,565
who has always stayed by my side.

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,033
The culprit is Cho Heeja.
It should be her.

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,162
If we can't find the evidence
for Father's case,

48
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,497
I'll prove it by my mom's case.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,294
That case

50
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,508
was expired.

51
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,143
We can't indict her with it.

52
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,531
I'll prove it anyway.

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,581
Bro.

54
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,237
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

55
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,613
Why did you wake up?

56
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,448
I couldn't sleep.

57
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,622
What's on your mind this time?

58
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,586
Gosh, I could never fool you.

59
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,965
I just...

60
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,969
I'm scared if I made any mistake.

61
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,516
It's been a long time since I heard that.

62
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,393
What do you mean?

63
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,855
When you first worked there,
what you said every day

64
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,315
was that you were scared.

65
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,442
- I did?
- Yes.

66
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,446
You couldn't sleep
worrying if you missed anything.

67
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,865
You even talked in your sleep.

68
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,617
Really?

69
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,912
You've worked that hard for 30 years.

70
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,039
I know that.

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,587
But this time,
I think I truly missed something.

72
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm really scared.

73
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,175
Then,

74
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,676
just get it right.

75
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,556
You'll find the way.

76
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,436
And

77
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,313
you have a daughter

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,441
who is a very capable detective.

79
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,238
That's right.

80
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,492
Now, go get some sleep.

81
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,951
I'll come soon.

82
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,621
Okay. Don't be too late.

83
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,739
"Case report
Victim: Kim Seonyoung"

84
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,161
"Two unidentified fingerprints"

85
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,386
Come in.

86
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,720
You're early today.

87
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,056
Oh, Captain.

88
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,599
Are you busy now?

89
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,893
Not really.

90
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,438
Can you help me with something?

91
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,358
Sure.

92
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
Captain.

93
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
Yes.

94
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,173
Right. It's here.

95
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,594
Oh, well...

96
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,429
What's all this?

97
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,183
Files that were left
when the police system was computerized.

98
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,895
What are you searching for here?

99
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,065
The culprit that I missed.

100
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,402
Let's start.

101
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,872
Is it tough? You're grunting.

102
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,790
No, I feel good.

103
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,626
It reminds me of our old days.

104
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,711
We wasted so much time,

105
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,505
to put it the most mildly.

106
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,589
Jeez.

107
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,466
These days,

108
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,676
security cams are everywhere.

109
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,679
Young cops would never know
how difficult it was.

110
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,389
You sound like a boomer.

111
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,601
I'll just keep living

112
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,770
like a boomer.

113
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,147
Oh, here it is.

114
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,232
"Evidence collected"

115
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,415
You needed these fingerprints?

116
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,459
Yes.

117
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,634
They were from children
who were not registered in the system,

118
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,843
so I couldn't scan them.

119
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,428
Now you can identify them.

120
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,016
Ask them
to check the components, too.

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,018
I'll tell them to make it quick.

122
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,312
Send the results to Ganghyun.

123
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,148
What?

124
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,026
She's in charge of this case now.

125
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,375
She's not talking
or reacting to the stimulation.

126
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,712
Isn't she acting?

127
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,171
I don't think so.

128
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,549
She's not eating at all, either.

129
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,094
It seems that she's rejecting
to be aware of the reality,

130
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,637
as if she's in a dream.

131
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,682
Why is she like that suddenly?

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,394
A few days ago, her son was here.

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,646
Since then, she's been getting worse.

134
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,660
I found the chauffeur

135
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,287
who worked for Ms. Cho.

136
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,670
We're not open yet.

137
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
Excuse me.

138
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,010
Are you Mr. Kim Daehyun?

139
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,179
Yes.

140
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,684
25 years ago, October 10th.

141
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,354
It's way too long ago, right?

142
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,438
No.

143
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,273
I remember the day clearly.

144
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,609
It was the day I was fired.

145
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,988
Ms. Cho was upset so much on that day.

146
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,001
"34/5, Gangha 1-dong"

147
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,961
- Get moving.
- Yes, ma'am.

148
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,805
She went into a house
in Gangha-dong

149
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,723
and came out after a few minutes.

150
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,266
After a few minutes?

151
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,018
Yes, then...

152
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,728
She went home

153
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,772
and didn't come out.

154
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
She didn't come out?

155
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,276
She got dead drunk

156
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,278
and threw everything away, as I heard.

157
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,657
Do you remember what time it was

158
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,492
when you went to Gangha-dong?

159
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,245
It was at dusk.

160
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,914
So, maybe it was around 6 to 7 p.m.

161
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,543
"Estimated time of death:
10:00 - 11:00 p.m."

162
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,005
The one who came out at night
was her son.

163
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,175
I was staying there
in case they needed me,

164
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,469
and I saw her son coming out.

165
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,180
Where are you going?

166
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,516
Well, I'll visit somewhere for a bit.

167
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,851
I'll drive for you.

168
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,894
It's okay. It's close from here.

169
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,022
Where did he go?

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,691
I don't know,

171
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,651
but he went out

172
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,070
and injured from a car accident.

173
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,488
A car accident?

174
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,490
That's why I was fired.

175
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,201
I told him I'd give him a ride,

176
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,412
but he rejected.
So, I let him go alone, and...

177
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,498
Jeez.

178
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,333
They always blame workers like me.

179
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,811
Aren't you going home?

180
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,941
You have any problem?

181
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,527
I looked up everything,

182
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,615
but there's no convincing evidence.

183
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,701
Sometimes, evidence
just pops up all of a sudden.

184
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,664
When Jin's mom died,

185
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
some fingerprints found at the scene

186
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,127
were ruled out.

187
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,761
They were from unidentifiable children.

188
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,722
Children?

189
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,182
Yes.

190
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,850
So, I searched for them,

191
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,894
and they were still there.

192
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,939
I sent them to KCSI.

193
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,775
They'll tell you when the results are out.

194
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,444
Maybe you can start from there again.

195
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,697
Well...

196
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,782
Okay.

197
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
Yes.

198
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,808
On the day of my mom's death,

199
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,019
did Seungju have a car accident?

200
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,438
Yes,

201
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,648
he did.

202
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,316
What happened?

203
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,193
I don't know exactly.

204
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,696
I heard he was hospitalized
in Wonjong Hospital.

205
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,394
We are announcing the schedule

206
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,938
for the inaugural ceremony
of Jin Seungju, the new chairman.

207
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,648
Check the information below,

208
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,860
and please join the moment
of Hansu Group's new start.

209
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
Yesterday,

210
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,337
I met a chauffeur
who worked for Cho at that time.

211
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,130
Cho Heeja

212
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,049
has an alibi.

213
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,677
But that night,

214
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,597
Seungju went out and had a car accident.

215
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,559
I asked the hospital,
but they don't know the detail about it.

216
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,562
Please find out

217
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
where and how he had the accident.

218
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,525
Okay, I'll look into it.

219
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,196
In 1998?

220
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,073
It's October 10th, 1998.

221
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,908
You could find the record

222
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,534
of transferred patients.

223
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,744
Oh.

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,371
Wait here, please.

225
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
Sir.

226
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,138
Detective.

227
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,223
Here it is.

228
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,849
Thank you.

229
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
"Lee Ganghyun"

230
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,910
I found it.

231
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,704
The accident occurred

232
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,707
at 34 Gangha 1-dong...

233
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,803
which

234
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,596
"42/7, Saejung-ro"

235
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,473
is now Saejung-ro.

236
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,910
Hello, everyone.

237
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,662
I'm Jin Seungju

238
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,247
of Hansu Group.

239
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,708
Now, Hansu Group

240
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,002
is in the middle of crisis.

241
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,796
We need to transform

242
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,507
into a company that leads a trend,

243
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,384
not following the current trend.

244
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,179
I know everyone is so devastated

245
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,098
by the chairman's death.

246
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,516
However,

247
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,270
we should forget the past

248
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,356
and keep moving forward.

249
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,276
As my father hoped,

250
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
I will make

251
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,906
Hansu Group

252
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
firm and strong.

253
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,455
Thank you.

254
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
"Inauguration ceremony
of Chairman Jin Seungju"

255
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,646
Seungju.

256
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,772
Hey.

257
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,981
Thank you for coming.

258
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,651
Can I ask you something?

259
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,194
Sure.

260
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,279
25 years ago, on that day...

261
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
did you meet my mom?

262
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,459
Please excuse us.

263
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,669
Okay.

264
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,837
Come this way, please.

265
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,549
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
Did you come to my house

267
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,389
on the day of my mom's death?

268
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Answer me.

269
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,191
No.

270
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,901
I didn't.

271
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,196
I didn't even know where it was.

272
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,953
Isoo.

273
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,913
Forget about the past.

274
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,625
We have lots of things to do
from now on.

275
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,835
The two of us

276
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,796
-are the leaders of Hansu Group--
-I'm not interested.

277
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,091
"Why did my mom have to die?"

278
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,762
"Who is responsible for it?"

279
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,017
That's all I want to know.

280
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,104
You think

281
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm the one

282
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,529
who is responsible for that?

283
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,486
"Fingerprint scan result
for woman's suicide case in 1998"

284
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,745
"Unidentified fingerprints"

285
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,671
"One fingerprint was confirmed
to be Jin Isoo's"

286
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,684
"One fingerprint was confirmed
to be Jin Seungju's"

287
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,545
"Gun storage room"

288
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,881
Bro.

289
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,785
The meeting starts soon, sir.

290
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,247
Have a seat.

291
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,669
The takeover process

292
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,213
for Yeongil Electronics
will be completed by next week.

293
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,090
Yes, I heard about that.

294
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,216
Just go ahead.

295
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,384
Yes, sir.

296
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,636
The factory of Hansu Chemical--

297
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,894
Mr. Choi?

298
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,229
I need to talk to you.

299
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,940
Please excuse us, everyone.

300
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,817
Don't you see

301
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,862
we're having a meeting?

302
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,157
Leave for now.

303
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,939
Was it you...

304
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,776
who killed the chairman?

305
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,780
You cowardly made him
drink the sleeping pill

306
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,490
and deleted the dashcam footage?

307
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,619
Did you kill

308
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
Isoo's mom, Seonyoung, in the same way?

309
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,166
Only to get that position?

310
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,756
Seungju.

311
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,093
You don't deserve that position.

312
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,302
I...

313
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,557
will drag you down from there.

314
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,943
You were a wise man

315
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,863
when working in Hansu Pharmaceuticals.

316
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,491
Now you lost your wisdom.

317
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,705
Now,

318
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,999
resign and leave Hansu Group.

319
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,585
You're fired.

320
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,962
How long do you think you can hide it?

321
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,840
You think

322
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,593
you can stop Isoo?

323
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,184
You should get well quickly.

324
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,270
Your son became the chairman today.

325
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,356
He'd miss you so much.

326
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,404
Oh.

327
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,490
Do you hear me?

328
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,036
Yes, it's your son.

329
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,080
He became the chairman today.

330
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,583
Seungju?

331
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,210
Yes.

332
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,461
Jin Seungju.

333
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,880
Your son.

334
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,009
I'll go get the doctor.

335
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,141
Sweetie. You look great.

336
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,226
Look up.

337
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,562
You are the one who will lead Hansu Group.

338
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,357
Look up.

339
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,609
You are the one who will lead Hansu Group.

340
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,986
This is what you wanted.

341
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,531
You told me

342
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,242
to own Hansu Group at any cost.

343
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,870
That's what you've taught me.

344
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,442
Hello.

345
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,820
Sir, Ms. Cho...

346
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,923
Isoo.

347
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,010
Have I ever...

348
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,639
lied to you?

349
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,642
I was also a child at that time.

350
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,810
I didn't know what happened.

351
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,687
25 years ago, on that day...

352
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,356
did you meet my mom?

353
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,150
No,

354
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,069
I didn't.

355
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,448
She told me not to try
to find out a reason.

356
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,532
But it's hard.

357
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,867
I want to know.

358
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,453
Stop thinking about that.

359
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,580
You might hurt yourself.

360
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,884
If you have anything in your mind,

361
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,968
just tell me.

362
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,137
Isoo.

363
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,056
Forget about the past.

364
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,060
We have lots of things to do from now on.

365
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
We are the leaders of Hansu Group.

366
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,695
You know that I'm on your side, right?

367
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
Cho Heeja

368
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,092
attempted suicide.

369
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,011
She has an alibi.

370
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,473
If, despite that, she attempted suicide,

371
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,477
that means her son is the culprit.

372
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,230
What will you do with him?

373
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,198
Hey.

374
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,616
Seungju.

375
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,494
We need to talk.

376
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,080
Come to my office.

377
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,498
No.

378
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,959
You come to my house.

379
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,960
Who opened this file?

380
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,631
Isoo was here a while ago.

381
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,566
"confirmed to be Jin Seungju's"

382
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,367
"Gun storage room"

383
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,577
Find out

384
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,037
where Jin is now.

385
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,793
"Lee Ganghyun"

386
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,848
Have a seat.

387
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,366
Drink it.

388
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,287
Why?

389
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,956
Are you scared?

390
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,585
-What are you doing?
-At the scene of my mom's death,

391
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,211
your fingerprint was found.

392
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,089
It was on this juice glass.

393
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,842
They thought she committed suicide.

394
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,305
Because it was not registered,

395
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,515
they couldn't identify it.

396
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,192
Did you kill my mom?

397
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,662
Are you going to suspect me forever?

398
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,001
Let's stop
this dumb conversation.

399
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,014
Was it you

400
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,685
who killed my mom?

401
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,399
Damn it.

402
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,905
What if I met your mom

403
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,033
and drank juice here?
Why does that matter so much?

404
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,743
Did you kill my mom? Answer me!

405
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,884
- Mom.
- If you take this,

406
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,261
you can die without pain

407
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,848
as if you're sleeping.

408
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,687
Father is going to kick us out.

409
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,232
His real son appeared.

410
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,442
Mom.

411
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,568
Please stop.

412
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,903
I'll die.

413
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,363
I can't be just kicked out.

414
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,906
Father won't do that to us.

415
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,037
Do you trust your father?

416
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,750
He's a cold-hearted man.

417
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,144
"Law Firm Hansu"

418
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,948

420
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,673
Where are you going?

421
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,009
Well, I'll visit somewhere for a bit.

422
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,093
I'll drive for you.

423
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,845
It's okay. It's close from here.

424
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,805
Please get on.
It's going to rain.

425
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,515
I don't need your help.

426
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,535
Please open the door.

427
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,954
Who's there?

428
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,707
I'm Chairman Jin's son.

429
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,307
You're drenched.

430
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,894
Come on in.

431
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,746
Father

432
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,625
is going to divorce my mom.

433
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,379
Are you

434
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,756
getting married to him?

435
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,718
If you do that,

436
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,930
my mom will die.

437
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,811
No,

438
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,731
that's not going to happen.

439
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,277
I'm not going to marry him.

440
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,155
Don't worry about that.

441
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,705
Have you eaten?

442
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,293
Wait here.

443
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,686
"missed call 1"

444
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,902
I prepared all the documents.

445
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,570
All I need is your decision.

446
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,885
Eat up.

447
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,393
I'm on my way.

448
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,769
I'll be there in an hour.

449
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,498
Fine.

450
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,044
So, what if I killed her?

451
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,131
What are you going to do,
you bastard?

452
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,924
Will you shoot me?

453
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,676
Shoot me.

454
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,763
Shoot me, you punk.

455
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,058
You already believe I'm the culprit,

456
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,143
don't you?

457
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,564
My mom

458
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,112
didn't do anything wrong.

459
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,411
Right.

460
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,084
I should've killed you on that day.

461
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,842
Shit.

462
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,344
Come on, you punk.

463
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,826
If you didn't exist,

464
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,661
I didn't have to do this.

465
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,454
I told you to behave yourself,

466
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,747
didn't I?

467
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,710
What did you do
to keep your position?

468
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,254
You did nothing.

469
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,922
You've been forgiven

470
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,590
for any immaturity or troublemaking

471
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,217
because you're Father's real son.

472
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,386
But...

473
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,680
I had to do anything.

474
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,391
That's why I killed your mom

475
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,685
and Father.

476
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,812
That was the only way for me

477
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,648
to take this position.

478
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,899
Die.

479
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,526
You die, punk!

480
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,861
Stop that bullshit!

481
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,197
Shut up!

482
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,878
Damn it.

483
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
Why

484
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,888
were you kind to me?

485
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,974
Why?

486
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,934
You were sorry?

487
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,562
No way.

488
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,315
Because you were pitiful, punk.

489
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,337
I'll take away everything you have.

490
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,548
Your fortune,

491
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,092
your position, your honor,

492
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,887
and your family.

493
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,098
I'll make you the one who has nothing.

494
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,938
That's where you should be.

495
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,572
Hey.

496
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,243
Hey.

497
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,452
You think

498
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,914
you have the power to do that?

499
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,874
Do you?

500
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,046
Your mom's case has been expired,

501
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,091
and there's no evidence for Father's case.

502
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,385
I can kill you now

503
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,720
right here

504
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,933
and tell them it was a self-defense.

505
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,485
You've been scared

506
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,491
if Father finds out
that you're not his real son, right?

507
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,373
You've tried everything
to make Father like you.

508
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,669
You covered the truth

509
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,879
and committed murders.

510
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,388
Cowardly and cruelly.

511
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,727
Father had known everything.

512
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,814
He knew you were not his real son.

513
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,282
But he accepted your mom.

514
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,957
He accepted you

515
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,169
and trusted you.

516
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,762
You killed that kind of person.

517
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,732
All those terrible things you committed

518
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,115
were for nothing.

519
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,320
It's empty.

520
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,167
Never die.

521
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,509
Live forever, haunted by regret.

522
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,902
Jin!

523
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,953
Last night, Mr. Jin Seungju

524
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,997
confessed everything.

525
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,541
Kim Seonyoung,
who died 25 years ago,

526
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,585
was turned out to have been murdered.

527
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,587
But that case has expired,

528
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,547
so you can't indict him, right?

529
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,719
Right. I'm so sorry for that
as a police officer.

530
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,013
But

531
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,685
it'd be more important

532
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,898
for the bereaved family
to find out the truth.

533
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,653
Then, what will happen
to Mr. Jin Seungju?

534
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,573
What about the investigation
for Chairman Jin's case?

535
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,953
We're not in charge of that.

536
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,081
Seoul Metropolitan Police
will keep investigating.

537
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,975
Mr. Jin Isoo.

538
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,647
We caught the culprit too late.

539
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,608
We're so sorry.

540
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:47,990
No, it's okay.

541
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,326
I still remember

542
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,163
you hugged me

543
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,790
and protected me

544
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,963
warmly and kindly.

545
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,133
And

546
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,469
thank you

547
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,432
for finding the evidence.

548
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,189
Okay.

549
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,858
Thank you.

550
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,296
Jin Myeongchul,
who passed away a few days ago,

551
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,006
turned out to have been murdered.

552
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,633
Shockingly,

553
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,093
the culprit was Jin Seungju,
the eldest son.

554
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,678
Oh Jiyeon is reporting.

555
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,222
Last night, Vice Chairman Jin

556
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,099
made a full confession of his crime.

557
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,937
Jin stated that he committed the crime
alone in the villa.

558
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,065
The police didn't explain
the exact murder motive

559
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,735
but dismissed that it was his desire
for Chairman's position.

560
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,405
Despite knowing
that he was not a real son,

561
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,908
the defendant killed his father,

562
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,910
who raised him for his whole life,
for his own greed.

563
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,829
Although the case was expired,

564
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,625
he also turned out
to have killed his half-brother's mother.

565
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,419
The defendant's murderous deed

566
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,130
claimed valuable human lives.

567
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,968
Hence, a severe punishment
is inevitable for the defendant.

568
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,844
However,

569
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,931
considering that the defendant
has no other criminal records

570
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,600
and all the other sentencing conditions,

571
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,310
the court hereby imposes

572
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,856
a life imprisonment sentence
on the defendant.

573
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
Finally,

574
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,761
we're here together.

575
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,978
Having a drink together

576
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,440
was not such a big deal.

577
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,236
I thought we had a lot of time left.

578
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,784
"Jin Myeongchul's grave"

579
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,298
I'll relay your message

580
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,679
to her.

581
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,666
This is
what Father wanted to give you.

582
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,839
You knew everything, right?

583
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,382
"Kim Seonyoung"

584
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,509
Now,

585
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,262
you two might be together.

586
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,770
The days we spent together

587
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,234
feel like a dream.

588
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,075
I miss you.

589
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,126
You're back.

590
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,630
Oh.

591
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,757
I need to pick up something.

592
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,221
Have you eaten?

593
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,682
Not yet.

594
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,479
Here. Eat up.

595
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,615
You've gone through a hard time.

596
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,911
It must've been tough.

597
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,961
Everything's gonna be fine.

598
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,089
You did great.

599
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,421
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,613
Did you check
the outlook report by Finance Team?

601
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,822
Yes, I did.

602
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,407
The liquidity ratio

603
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,242
is good year-on-year.

604
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,162
I checked the cams
in the elevator and hallway,

605
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,497
but no one looked suspicious.

606
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,041
So, he sneaked in
through this terrace.

607
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,710
Is it possible for a man
to climb up to this height?

608
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,836
Gang Dongsu.

609
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,588
Where

610
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,174
is the accomplice?

611
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,134
I don't know.

612
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,637
You see the cam over there?

613
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,180
I really don't know.

614
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,765
You'd better tell the truth.

615
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,267
We risk our lives
catching the culprit.

616
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,144
Hey, I'm not lying.

617
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,521
I did what I was ordered.

618
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,567
- Checked the security cam?
- Yes, I did.

619
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,694
- The forensic result?
- Not yet.

620
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,114
I'll be there.

621
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,198
Okay, okay.

622
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,616
Okay.

623
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,897
Yes, we need
to look into law firms.

624
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,216
Yes, I'll check Kim Jaehong's law firm...

625
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,575
Why are you not eating?

626
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,868
It's good.

627
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,413
To be honest,

628
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,749
I've already had dinner.

629
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,710
Then, why...

630
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,048
I just...

631
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:32,717
wanted

632
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,344
to stay with you.

633
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,647
You wanted

634
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,819
to stay with me?

635
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,491
Cheers.

636
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,371
Gosh, it's good.

637
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,790
Jin Isoo,
the second son of Hansu,

638
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,917
will be inaugurated as Chairman tomorrow.

639
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,628
He's been the leader
of Management Strategy Team for 5 years,

640
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,089
and he'll be
the youngest chairman ever

641
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,840
at the age of 31.

642
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,217
Board of directors...

643
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,426
It's tomorrow, right?

644
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,804
Right.

645
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,390
He finally got back to his position.

646
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,519
He was not the one
who should be here for long.

647
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,980
Ms. Lee must be sad.

648
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,692
They were good partners.

649
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,795
Good morning.

650
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,426
This desk...

651
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,013
We should remove it now.

652
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:42,735
What's up?

653
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,822
Ms. Lee wants us to remove Isoo's desk.

654
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,533
Yes, we should.

655
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,245
Submit the report by tomorrow.

656
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,329
Okay.

657
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,373
"Letter of Resignation
Jin Isoo"

658
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,599
Gosh, it's cold.

659
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,476
-Jin?
-Bro!

660
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,520
It's snowing outside.

661
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:00,813
Why are you here?

662
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,149
Why?

663
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,401
I'm here to work, Ms. Lee.

664
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,611
Hey, sit down.

665
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,197
What about your company?

666
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,366
Oh.

667
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,368
As my father's wished,

668
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,329
I entrusted it to the right person.

669
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:18,998
First of all,

670
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,835
I'd like to thank the people
who recommended me

671
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,503
for the chairman's position.

672
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,174
My father

673
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,969
wanted someone who is really capable

674
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,556
to be the leader of Hansu Group.

675
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,059
But,

676
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,770
as you know,

677
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,148
I'm not that capable.

678
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,317
Right?

679
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,404
So, I brought a reliable man

680
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,282
whom you can trust.

681
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,404
I knew you'd come back.

682
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,824
You've not submitted

683
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,994
my resignation letter, right?

684
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,203
I'm submitting it now.

685
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,496
- No, hey.
- No.

686
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,790
Why not?
I kept it for too long--

687
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,041
-Come on, Ms. Lee.
-No.

688
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,419
-Ganghyun.
-You've been absent without notice.

689
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,343
A written apology.

690
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,469
I'll submit it.

691
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,554
"A" written apology?

692
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,972
You think that's enough?

693
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,849
You should write 20 pieces.

694
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,058
Let's just submit it.

695
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,184
Oh, should we?

696
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,355
Be quiet, Team 1.

697
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,440
Team 2, be quiet!

698
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,863

699
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,740
What?

700
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:19,994
I got it.

701
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,086
A case occurred.

702
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,965
It's so exciting.

703
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,510
Let's go.

704
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,203
Ms. Lee.

705
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,748
Let me drive.

706
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,175
Here.
