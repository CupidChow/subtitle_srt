THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS

5
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,045
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,091
This place is on sale at a good price.

7
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,177
It's spacious and bright.

8
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,428
Oh.

9
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,015
What's really good is
that it has a garage.

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,813
They left some stuff here.

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,442
The owner will clean them up.

12
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,986
Come see inside.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,154
It's spacious, right?

14
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,657
Jeez, they even left these stuffs.

15
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,744
Hey, ma'am.

16
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,037
Someone collapsed here.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,371
There's a man.

18
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,664
That's a man.

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,677
Hey.

20
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,220
Why are you so nervous?

21
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
What?

22
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,099
Me?

23
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,393
Was it real when you collapsed

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,561
in the autopsy room?

25
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,480
No way. I was just playing a trick.

26
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,440
You can't even look at him directly.

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,026
I can.

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,654
I'm just trying to look at the entire body

29
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,738
and then...

30
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,657
look into it thoroughly.

31
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,644
There's a latching device,

32
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,770
but it was not used.

33
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
Is that so?

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,900
- We need to identify him first.
- Wait.

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,110
You don't know who he is?

36
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,695
Look into him closer like me.

37
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,155
You see as much as you know.

38
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,073
You don't read economics magazines?

39
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,534
No wonder. You don't even watch news.

40
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,911
Who is he?

41
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,539
He was on the cover
of Korea Business Magazine on March.

42
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,251
Choi Seonu, the CEO of SW SOFT.

43
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,836
Right. Choi Seonu.

44
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,756
How can I be so smart?

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,633
I read it just once on the plane
but didn't forget--

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
Shut the mouth, and you'll look smarter.

47
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,802
Oh.

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,387
That's not what I'm pursuing.

49
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,722
Investigate Choi Seonu more.

50
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,973
Okay.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,769
Why is he here?

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,063
Gosh.

53
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,192
What's going on here?

54
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,320
- Do you think you know him?
- No.

55
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,447
- He's a total stranger to me.
- Hey.

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,616
You don't read economics magazines, right?

57
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,700
What?

58
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,205
How long has this office been unoccupied?

59
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,041
For one or two months?

60
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,294
I visited here last week,
but no one was here.

61
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,963
I see.

62
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,506
Okay. Thank you.

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,590
Yes.

64
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,510
Jeez...

65
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,972
No way.

66
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,976
Why did he die
in an empty office?

67
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,311
This place
was Choi Seonu's office.

68
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,980
He started his first business here.

69
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,149
Yes. He started it
with only three staffs at first.

70
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,484
So it was here.

71
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,279
He successfully grew a unicorn group
by his own effort.

72
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,364
How can the IT legend die like this?

73
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,742
Why? You feel life is vain?

74
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,202
Interesting.

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,037
It's gonna be a difficult case.

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,580
Don't say it that way.

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,958
- That's annoying.
- Me?

78
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,418
Or investigation?

79
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,502
Both.

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,296
- Kyungjin.
-  Yes.

81
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,839
Go get a security camera footage

82
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,257
and find Choi Seonu's car.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,134
- Okay.
- Move. Quickly.

84
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,263
It's gonna be a difficult case.

85
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,308
By his own effort,

86
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,434
grew a unicorn...

87
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,649
Police.

88
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,797
Did anything happen

89
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,633
to your husband recently?

90
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,803
All of a sudden,
everything's got messed up.

91
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
The situation got worse in his company.

92
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,100
He couldn't sleep at night,

93
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,728
so he even got psychotherapy.

94
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,147
But he said

95
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,648
he could manage it.

96
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,446
Was he

97
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,656
murdered by someone?

98
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,160
We're still on investigation,

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,120
but no sign of homicide yet.

100
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,663
He called me.

101
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,707
He said someone was trying to kill him.

102
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,960
He said I could also be killed
and told me to run away.

103
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,181
- Yeah?
-  <i>I found Choi's car.</i>

104
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,474
<i>It was left on the road.</i>

105
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,559
- The key's also here.
- <i>Check the dashcam.</i>

106
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,520
I'll check the autopsy.

107
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,024
Hello.

108
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
Hello.

109
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,819
It's finished, right?

110
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,070
Yes.

111
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,280
No sign of a wound, injection,

112
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,490
or drug.

113
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
What?

114
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,036
I've worked here for eight years,

115
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,832
but I've never seen a body like this.

116
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
The cause of death

117
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,253
is dehydration.

118
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,005
Dehydration?

119
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,175
You mean, he didn't drink water?

120
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,470
His stomach is empty.

121
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,639
He hadn't eaten for at least four days.

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,516
And he's been dead

123
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,143
for one day.

124
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,519
How can a human

125
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
die like that?

126
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,771
That's...

127
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,108
what you need to find out.

128
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,409
I really don't understand it.

129
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,370
There was a bundle of water bottles,

130
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,038
and the door was open.

131
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,416
He was holding his cell phone.

132
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,627
What happened to him?

133
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,255
- You've seen any case like this?
- No.

134
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,382
I've seen a lot of weird bodies...

135
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,512
but never seen anything like this.

136
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,223
I really want
to solve this mystery.

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,892
I feel a sense of duty to solve this--

138
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,268
Yeah, that's right.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,230
Just go home and think about it.

140
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,191
-  Hey, we need to talk
- Go home.

141
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,359
- more about this mystery.
- Okay, enough. Go home.

142
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,777
Think about it at home.

143
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,905
Hey, let go of me.

144
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,119
You told me
not to care about him,

145
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,664
but now you're close enough
to share a car?

146
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,541
Is it because of that kimchi?

147
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,377
- No, it's not that.
-  Don't try to hide it.

148
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,632
He's in my team.

149
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
What?

150
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,469
Is he a detective?

151
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,595
Yes.

152
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,721
Gosh, hey.

153
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,432
- That's not bad.
- What's not bad?

154
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,267
Don't even try to imagine anything.

155
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,103
Why don't you invite him over for a meal?

156
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,813
-  No way.
-  Hey.

157
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,945
Let's go by my car.

158
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,239
No, I'll use mine.

159
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,300
"Choi Seonu's death case"

160
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,885
"The CEO of SW SOFT"

161
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,637
"Water bottles, cell phone in hand,
no wound"

162
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,430
"Company in bad situation,
death threats"

163
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,224
"latching device, not used"

164
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,478
"No wound or sign of injection or drug"

165
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,105
"Cause of death: dehydration"

166
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,483
"bottles of water kept intact"

167
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,988
Good morning.

168
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
Hey, hey.

169
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,327
On my way here in the morning,

170
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,538
I saw that your mom was smiling at me.

171
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,627
She couldn't be.

172
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,588
You got it wrong.

173
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,423
No. Her smile was cute

174
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,383
<i>but a little scary.</i>

175
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,552
She was smiling at me.

176
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,012
- For sure?
- Yes.

177
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,931
I doubt that.

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,149
- Got the dashcam?
-  Yes.

179
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,158
That again in this early morning?

180
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,342
Here.

181
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,596
<i>I can't do it anymore.</i>

182
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,847
<i>What did you say?</i>

183
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,807
<i>We'll be in big trouble.</i>

184
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,017
<i>Let's stop it.</i>

185
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,103
And here.

186
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,148
We should find this man first.

187
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,442
Yes.

188
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,653
I found
who talked last with him.

189
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,031
It's Seo Yukyung,

190
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,532
a famous psychiatrist.

191
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
We've got to see her.

192
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
Yeah.

193
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,133
Jin will go with me,

194
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,761
and you go to the company
and check this man.

195
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,845
Okay.

196
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,013
Let's go by my car.

197
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,018
Ganghyun.

198
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,604
Why do you always go around with him?

199
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,815
Wow.

200
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,109
I should watch him.

201
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,111
- Will you do it?
-  It really is gold?

202
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
Of course.
You think I plated it?

203
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,448
-  Arrest me.
- You're under arrest.

204
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,908
How dare...

205
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,326
Or should I let him do it?

206
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,495
Spare me, detective.
The fault is all mine.

207
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,788
I'm the only one, right?

208
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,748
-  Isoo, it hurts.
-  Stay put!

209
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,208
Jin, let's go.

210
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,335
- Release me.
- I'll let you go this time.

211
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
Be good, you punk.

212
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,923
-  I'll not forget your generosity.
-  Good.

213
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,134
"YK Hospital"

214
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,279
What brought you here?

215
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,823
I'm here to see a doctor
and for something else.

216
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,881
This hospital looks like a hotel.

217
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,720
Hello.

218
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,804
Made a reservation?

219
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,889
No.

220
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,766
We're police.

221
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,727
How are you running this place
when I barely see patients?

222
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,437
How much is the fee here?

223
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,649
Our customers never care about the fee.

224
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,485
I'm also rich.

225
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,694
I just wonder.

226
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,491
Please come this way.

227
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,535
Enough of silly talking.

228
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,661
Do you not wonder?

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,830
You lack curiosity as a detective.

230
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,803
Please come in.

231
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,833
What brought you here?

232
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,751
Oh.

233
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,088
We need to ask you about Mr. Choi Seonu.

234
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,423
You know him well, right?

235
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
Yes.

236
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,593
He's one of my patients.

237
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,719
What kind of disease

238
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,805
did he have?

239
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,892
What our customers
are concerned about the most

240
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,936
- is security.
- He passed away.

241
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,778
I still can't tell you.

242
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,281
Come back with a warrant.

243
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,747
How did he die?

244
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,250
It's a kind of...

245
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,128
weird suicide.

246
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,796
In the storage of his office,

247
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,715
he didn't eat anything

248
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,967
and ended up dying
from dehydration.

249
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,887
You think this is possible?

250
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
When some patients feel extreme fear,

251
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,600
they're not able to go out.

252
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,060
Was it possible that he didn't drink water

253
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,521
when water was right next to him?

254
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm not sure about that.

255
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,572
If he collapsed having a fit

256
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,908
when the dehydration started,

257
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,285
he could've fallen into unconsciousness

258
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,912
and died.

259
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,247
He once was hospitalized

260
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,249
due to a sudden seizure last time.

261
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,464
Mr. Choi Seonu

262
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,341
called you every day for four days

263
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,344
before he died, right?

264
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,390
Right.

265
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,934
We talked on the phone.

266
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,644
What did he say?

267
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,103
He was in panic.

268
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,230
He said

269
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,191
someone was trying to kill him.

270
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,240
It's so weird.

271
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,201
I still don't get it.

272
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,161
Dehydration and seizure.

273
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,704
That makes sense.

274
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,789
No.

275
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,291
I feel we're missing a key point
of this mystery.

276
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,671
The first suspect is Dr. Seo.

277
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,466
You suspect everyone you meet.

278
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,842
She's a psychiatrist.

279
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,302
Isn't it suspicious?

280
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,597
In the movies,
most criminals are psychiatrists.

281
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,058
The reason that you suspect her

282
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,434
is the movies?

283
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,603
Movies reflect the reality.

284
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,234
By the way, do you know Dr. Seo?

285
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,860
No.

286
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
Why?

287
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,572
She seemed to know who you are.

288
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,412
Is she my follower?

289
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,663
Why didn't she tell me?

290
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,747
I could follow her back.

291
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,332
Right.

292
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,251
You're the center of the universe.

293
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,377
Hey.

294
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,045
Now you know me.

295
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,213
Get on.

296
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,098
He's Cho Sunggu,

297
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,726
the leader
of our Customer Management Team.

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,561
Can we see him now?

299
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,897
I'm afraid he's not coming here
since Monday.

300
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,443
Is it true that our president...

301
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,779
has passed away?

302
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,575
Yes.

303
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,747
We confirmed the footage

304
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,541
where those two were talking
about something serious.

305
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,835
Was there anything special

306
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,837
between the president and Cho Sunggu?

307
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,632
Our company is currently...

308
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,385
in a bad situation.

309
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,056
So, the president seemed to have used
company funds to invest in coins.

310
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,224
But the prices have plunged.

311
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,020
Cho found it out somehow
and blackmailed the president

312
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,313
to charge him for embezzlement.

313
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,981
I found it out yesterday.

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,692
Can we get Mr. Cho's address?

315
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,403
Just a moment.

316
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,340
Mr. Cho Sunggu.

317
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,134
We're from Gangha Police Station.
Please open the door.

318
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,598
- Ask help to the manager.
- Okay.

319
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,768
Wait.

320
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,524
Damn it.

321
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,510
-  You're here.
- Hello.

322
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,971
- Hello.
- Hello.

323
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,348
The body...

324
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,143
looks pretty horrible.

325
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,896
Are you worrying about me?

326
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,440
How sweet.

327
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,542
This building smells like sewers.

328
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,627
What's this rotten smell?

329
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,962
Well, Isoo.

330
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,135
-  You okay?
- What happened?

331
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,470
We came here
right after getting his address.

332
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,015
Damn it.

333
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,975
Bro, this will help.

334
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,644
- I don't like mint.
- It's not mint.

335
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,188
Mint chocolate.

336
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,606
Mr. Choi.

337
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,316
I have a favor.

338
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,285
Here.

339
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,960
Okay.

340
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,462
Here you are.

341
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,546
Take care.

342
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,631
Yes.

343
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,893
The victim was sitting, right?

344
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,270
These bloodstains here...

345
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,402
Go ahead.

346
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,952
Okay.

347
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,955
There's no empty space
between these bloodstains.

348
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,039
Right.

349
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,375
He was attacked
from the back while sitting.

350
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>With a sharp knife,</i>

351
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,253
his artery

352
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,671
<i>was slashed at a stroke</i>

353
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,507
by someone very skillful.

354
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,177
The culprit could be a professional.

355
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
Right.

356
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,638
How long has he been dead?

357
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,848
I can't figure out the exact time,

358
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,645
but I found this little cutie.

359
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,897
It's a pupa of a green bottle fly.

360
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,566
He's been dead for about a week.

361
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,077
"Cho Sunggu's death case in the officetel"

362
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,752
 Cho Sunggu died a week ago,

363
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,587
and the next day,

364
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,424
Choi Seonu hid in the storage
and died after four days.

365
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,555
What did the doctor say?

366
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,181
Choi was hospitalized recently,

367
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,683
and he got better.

368
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,853
But he sounded panicked on the phone

369
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,063
saying someone was trying to kill him.

370
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,568
She thinks he had a seizure
during the dehydration.

371
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,945
Did Choi Seonu

372
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,323
kill Cho, who was blackmailing him,

373
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,283
and died while hiding in the storage?

374
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,327
That's possible.

375
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,995
But then,

376
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,496
why was the two billion won

377
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
not taken?

378
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,376
Okay, this is the key point here.

379
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,462
Why didn't Choi drink water?

380
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,256
Even if he was scared,

381
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
or he killed Cho,
why didn't he drink water?

382
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,426
"bottles of water kept intact"

383
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,554
Checked the security cams
around the scene?

384
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,722
Yes, I did,

385
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,599
but there's no cam on the 5th floor.

386
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,267
It's only on the first floor,

387
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,186
so it was no help.

388
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,646
We got fingerprints
on the money bags.

389
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
Damn!

390
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,988
The second daughter of MK,

391
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,156
Hong Euna?

392
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,783
Why is her fingerprint here?

393
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,493
I tried to find her,

394
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,952
but I couldn't.

395
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,245
And she's not answering the phone.

396
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,663
I hope she doesn't answer.

397
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,082
Don't.

398
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,959
Hello, I'm--

399
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,086
<i>What the hell?</i>

400
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,129
<i>Who the hell keeps calling?</i>

401
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,589
<i>Wanna end your life?</i>

402
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,549
<i>I'll kill you if you bother me again.</i>

403
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,427
Hello--

404
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
Stop it.

405
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,597
She has anger management issues

406
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,974
as many rich daughters do.

407
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,518
How do you know that?

408
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,645
They were a legendary couple

409
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,688
before the Gangnamdaero case last year.

410
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,981
Gangnamdaero case?

411
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,191
Kyungjin.

412
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,319
"Jin Isoo on Gangnamdaero"

413
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,614
Cool.

414
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,698
Gosh, my trauma.

415
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,450
<i>I'm Hong Euna!</i>

416
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,452
<i>I'm Jin Isoo!</i>

417
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,870
<i>Let's stop it.</i>

418
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,996
<i>Stop what?</i>

419
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,706
<i>It's me who decides to stop.</i>

420
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,750
<i>It's me who can break our relationship.</i>

421
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,627
<i>Okay, then. You decide.</i>

422
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,962
<i>Ditch me. Go ahead.</i>

423
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,922
<i>- What?
- Please say, "Let's break up."</i>

424
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,466
<i>What a crazy bastard.</i>

425
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Hey, let go.</i>

426
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,762
-  <i>Let go of me.</i>
- <i>I knew you'd be like this.</i>

427
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,472


428
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,558
 <i>Hey, stop shooting.</i>

429
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,770
That's still being passed around?

430
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,857
You should go see her anyway.

431
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,608
- Me?
- Yes.

432
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,402
No, I won't.

433
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,950
I decided never to see her in this life.

434
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,411
We need her statement to solve this case.

435
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,205
Yes,
we need your skillful talent.

436
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,585
I know I'm talented, but...

437
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,379
Jeez, she's really...

438
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,714
Gosh.

439
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,925
My heart is pounding now.

440
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,862
<i>We have an interview today.</i>

441
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,946
<i>Come here.</i>

442
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,198
<i>You're our family, too.</i>

443
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,328
Hold here,

444
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,580
- and cut here diagonally.
-  Like this?

445
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,040
Yes.

446
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,334
- Keep practicing.
-  Okay.

447
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,566
Why are you here all of a sudden?

448
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,820
You still can't forget me, right?

449
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,323
How could I?

450
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,407
You're too late.

451
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,117
I'm getting married.

452
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,080
With whom?

453
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,665
Why?

454
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,250
Are you jealous?

455
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,628
Please just tell me who he is.

456
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,381
I'll send him condolence flowers.

457
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,138
You're still good at pissing me off.

458
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,723
But I've changed.

459
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,808
I can tell.

460
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,227
Not throwing me anything,
but arranging flowers.

461
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,728
It's kind of a bridal class.

462
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
Do I look good with it?

463
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,607
You know this man, right?

464
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,444
- What's that?
- It's not an object but a person.

465
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,529
Take a close look.

466
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,573
What the hell are you doing?

467
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,034
You don't know yet?

468
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,619
I'm a detective now.

469
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,292
That's the funniest thing
that I've ever heard this year.

470
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,335
"Jin Isoo
Korean National Police Agency"

471
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,007
So you're here for work?

472
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,925
Not because you missed me?

473
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,803
He's dead.

474
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,724
And the bags with two billion next to him
had your fingerprints on them.

475
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,559
What happened?

476
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,937
I was blackmailed.

477
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,314
You beat someone up again?

478
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,398
It's not that!

479
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,154
You know, I'm getting married.

480
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,032
I was so nervous
that I went to the psychiatrist.

481
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,700
I even got a special treatment.

482
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,535
And he blackmailed me with that,

483
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,579
so I gave him that money. That's all.

484
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,331
Was that

485
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,207
YK Hospital?

486
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,127
How do you know that?

487
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,670
Euna.

488
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,548
You can tell me everything.

489
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,425
I mean,

490
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,260
you can trust me.

491
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,103
Did you kill him?

492
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,106
What the fuck!

493
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,651
Hey.

494
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,027
Congratulations on your wedding!

495
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,820
- Good luck! Be happy.
- Hey!

496
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,039
<i>Don't even think about coming.</i>

497
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,540
<i>Know your place.</i>

498
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,216
Please look at the camera.

499
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,764
Thank you for inviting us over.

500
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,432
It's us who are grateful.

501
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,519
You took nice pictures
of our family, right?

502
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,857
How did you first meet each other?

503
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,942
Tell us the story.

504
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,194
Our story?

505
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,196
I was introduced to him by my father,

506
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,532
but I fell in love with him
at first sight.

507
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,409
It's hard to find

508
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
such a perfect man.

509
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,289
Thanks to him,
I got a decent son like Seungju.

510
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,503
Your second son is not coming?

511
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,296
He's been amazing these days.

512
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,133
He's too busy to be here.

513
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,181
Let's take

514
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,933
a family photo again.

515
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
Please look at the camera.

516
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,331
The National Seal
had been missing for long.

517
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,457
How did you get it?

518
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,793
As an exemplar
of <i>noblesse oblige</i>,

519
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,211
tell us about the new case

520
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,962
you're in charge.

521
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,216
Okay, everyone.

522
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,302
I've got some time for this.

523
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,971
So, raise your hand and ask me one by one.

524
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,307
I'll answer every question kindly.

525
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,810
Okay, there.

526
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,853
Didn't you have difficulties
during the investigation?

527
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,979
A lot.

528
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,064
Anyone else?

529
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,190
Yes?

530
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,275
Please explain
where you found the seal.

531
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,694
That's a secret. And next?

532
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,488
Are you satisfied
with your life as a cop?

533
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,032
That'll be a long story.

534
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,117
I'll explain it later.

535
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,911
Anyone else?

536
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,129
Jeez, I don't like the dish choices.

537
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,923
We didn't set any food for you.

538
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,467
You're not eating with us, right?

539
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,970
You made a good choice.

540
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,264
My stomach hurts if I eat with you.

541
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,558
I need to eat with good people.

542
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,976
Okay, get lost, then.

543
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,978
Sure.

544
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,856
An unwelcome guest is leaving.

545
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,776
By the way,

546
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,571
you need to find another plastic surgeon.

547
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,739
You look ten years older than Father.

548
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,200
That's too bad.

549
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,331
Isoo.

550
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,835
Eat with us before leaving.

551
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,004
I'm not hungry.

552
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,130
And I'm busy.

553
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,298
Okay.

554
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,091
Thanks for coming today.

555
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,093
I'm off.

556
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,920
Talked with Hong Euna?

557
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,004
Yes.

558
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,547
I almost got killed.

559
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,091
She was blackmailed?

560
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,885
She was blackmailed by Cho Sunggu.

561
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,888
She got psychotherapy
before her marriage

562
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,056
at YK Hospital.

563
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,100
The security system of YK Hospital

564
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,769
is from SW SOFT,

565
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,771
and Cho Sunggu was in charge of that.

566
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,314
Really?

567
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,067
He extracted patient information
and blackmailed them.

568
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,195
You mean, one of those patients
murdered Cho Sunggu?

569
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,906
Then, why did Choi Seonu die like that?

570
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,116
We need to investigate Hong Euna first.

571
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,535
I'm sure she's not.

572
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,703
I asked her already.

573
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,873
She's too impetuous to tell a lie.

574
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,627
Is it true that she was your girlfriend?

575
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,382
You waited for me to ask--

576
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,466
No way.

577
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,259
It's okay.

578
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,636
Ask me whatever you want.

579
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,012
I'm not interested.

580
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,890
Why do you rule out your ex
while suspecting everyone?

581
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,058
That's what I wonder.

582
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,643
- No, that's not.
- That's it.

583
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,186
- I don't think so.
- Shut up.

584
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,188
- Why--
-  You're together again.

585
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,441
Mom.

586
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
Hello.

587
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,695
Yes.

588
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,446
Have you eaten?

589
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,782
- No, not yet.
- Great.

590
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,410
I made galbitang. Come in and have some.

591
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,494
No, I'm fine.

592
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,332
Oh, should I?

593
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,834
I'm starving now.

594
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,794
Oh, good. Come in.

595
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,338
- I've had a long, hard day.
-  Gosh, really?

596
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,173
Ganghyun, come in already.

597
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,259
-  Just let her.
-  Jeez.

598
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,927
Ganghyun, come in.

599
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,889
Honey.

600
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,392
- Yes.
-  Honey, our neighbor is here.

601
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,811
He works with Ganghyun.

602
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,355
What a coincidence!

603
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,440
Oh, right.

604
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,316
Thank you for your help last time.

605
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,818
Help?

606
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,319
What do you mean?

607
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,905
I helped him
with gardening pine trees

608
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:53,990
a few days ago.

609
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,658
Oh, right. The pine tree.

610
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,993
Good job.

611
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,203
- Mom, I'm hungry.
-  Oh, right.

612
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,497
- Let's eat quickly. I'm starving.
- Oh, wait.

613
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,665
Okay, okay.

614
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,542
Just a moment.

615
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,544
Okay, I'll set the table.

616
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,255
Have a seat.

617
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,803
Galbitang is here.

618
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,639
Thank you.

619
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,433
- I'll go get octopus.
-  Okay.

620
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,269
Huh?

621
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,395
Huh?

622
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,315
Okay, it's all ready.

623
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,609
-  Let's eat.
-  Have a seat.

624
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,987
It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it.

625
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,530
Thanks.

626
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,076
I haven't had a home-cooked meal
for a long time...

627
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,705
since my mom had passed away
when I was young.

628
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,584
Must've been harsh for you.

629
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,005
Please enjoy, thinking
that your mom cooked it for you.

630
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,841
Okay, thank you.

631
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,518
Oh, gosh.

632
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,650
Slow down.

633
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,026
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

634
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,446
It's hot.

635
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,739
I choked.

636
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,157
Slow down.

637
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,173
Try this octopus.

638
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,676
Oh, octopus.

639
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,769
-  It's good, right?
- Yes, it is.

640
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,980
A moderate amount of salt

641
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,064
keeps you healthy.

642
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,068
Try this, too.

643
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,738
You okay?

644
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,949
No.

645
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,410
My blood pressure is going up.

646
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,995
You're overacting. Jeez.

647
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,499
I told you that you'd better not come.

648
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,251
Why didn't you listen to me?

649
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,920
As my mom gets older,

650
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,755
all of her food is badly seasoned.

651
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,965
It's too spicy

652
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,175
or too salty.

653
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,593
We're scared of her table.

654
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,304
Galbitang tasted like seawater.

655
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,183
It was warm, though.

656
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,945
"Oh, Yummy Chicken
Set menu for 2 servings"

657
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,744
Dr. Yoon?

658
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,081
Dr. Yoon.

659
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,250
Oh.

660
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,376
Detective Park?

661
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,836
Right, you said you live nearby.

662
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,504
What a coincidence.

663
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,548
-  Yes.
- Oh, well...

664
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,300
Have you eaten?

665
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,718
No, not yet.

666
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,844
Good.

667
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,263
I wanted to try this new restaurant,

668
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,558
but they only serve two servings.

669
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,310
You want to eat with me?

670
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,146
Sure.

671
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,399
Let's get in.

672
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,860
Looks yummy.

673
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,154
-  Enjoy.
-  Thanks.

674
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,573
How about...

675
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,035
soju?

676
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,746
Sure.

677
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,164
Why not?

678
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,540
One soju, please.

679
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,833
Thank you.

680
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,088
You shouldn't pour your own drink.

681
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,178
Cheers.

682
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,433
Great.

683
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,854
Hey, come in.

684
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,189
What are you doing there?

685
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,859
They look good.

686
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,569
What's good?

687
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,113
You're going too far.

688
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,698
No, I'm not.

689
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,908
I saw

690
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,576
Ganghyun was so sweet to him.

691
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,370
She was patting him on the back.

692
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,248
He's a rich son.

693
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,417
Rich son?

694
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,710
Yes.

695
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,295
The youngest son of Hansu.

696
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,671
He was on the news.

697
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,049
He's a rich son,

698
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,551
and he works with Ganghyun.

699
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,344
Now he has even moved near our house?

700
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,889
Honey.

701
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,850
This is a perfect romantic comedy.

702
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,812
A rich son-in-law?

703
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,036
Hey, Junyoung.

704
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,954
Track Hong Euna's recent whereabouts.

705
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,248
Okay.

706
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,972
You look so tired.

707
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,891
Do I?

708
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,101
You didn't sleep well?

709
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,269
No, I didn't.

710
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,398
Because you ate
something too salty?

711
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,774
No.

712
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,942
Let's go.

713
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,956
Do you know this man?

714
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,629
No, I don't.

715
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,214
Who's this?

716
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,007
He's Cho Sunggu,

717
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,343
who's in charge
of the security program here.

718
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,845
So?

719
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,680
He blackmailed your patients

720
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,598
after extracting their information.

721
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,518
What?

722
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,811
You didn't know that?

723
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,855
No, not at all.

724
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,731
Was he arrested?

725
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,316
He was found dead.

726
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,152
He was murdered.

727
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,031
What kind of information

728
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,658
did he extract? How?

729
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,285
We're not sure about that.

730
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,078
So, please help us.

731
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,248
We need your patients' information
and security cam footage.

732
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,293
Sorry, but I can't.

733
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,462
If I give you that information,

734
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,213
my life as a doctor will be over.

735
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,175
You need a warrant.

736
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,638
Yes, sir.

737
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,645
Excuse me.

738
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
Can I ask you something?

739
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,483
Sure.

740
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,068
If someone

741
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,070
has the same dream every night,

742
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,572
why does that happen?

743
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,866
Is it about yourself?

744
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,077
What kind of dream is it?

745
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,584
I go to the same place in my dream.

746
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,045
<i>I remember</i>

747
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,838
<i>it's somewhere I've never been to.</i>

748
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>And</i>

749
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,050
<i>I see the same thing every time.</i>

750
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,930
I need a further examination

751
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,556
to figure that out exactly,

752
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,517
but one thing is obvious.

753
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,311
In your mind,

754
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,147
there's something that's suppressed.

755
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,817
A dream is like a letter

756
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,528
from your unconscious.

757
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,406
Maybe your unconscious

758
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,368
has something to tell you.

759
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,586
I got it.

760
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,547
Yes, sir.

761
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,842
I don't think we can get a warrant.

762
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,386
The patients here

763
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,346
seem so powerful.

764
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,140
Right.

765
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,309
Hey, what's that dry reaction?

766
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,936
What?

767
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,480
What did you talk about?

768
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,524
Nothing.

769
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,608
Let's go.

770
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,075
Hey, Sherlock Holmes.

771
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,035
Why are you so quiet today?

772
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,371
Try to guess something.

773
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
Well...

774
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,874
I have no idea.

775
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,768
The public survey result
is out today.

776
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,438
We overtook Wang Jongtae
for the first time.

777
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,524
Especially, the approval rating
among young people has risen.

778
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,735
We shouldn't be relieved yet.

779
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,945
It's obvious
that the overall flow changed.

780
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,114
I think...

781
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,284
Isoo is helping you attract
the youth voters.

782
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,043
<i>Your son is dreaming of it.</i>

783
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,878
<i>His memory</i>

784
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,421
<i>will come back soon.</i>

785
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,884
You have something in mind, Father?

786
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,636
Oh.

787
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,096
It's nothing.

788
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,144
Please check it.

789
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,437
It's about recycling.

790
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,230
Let's protect our planet.

792
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,697
Excuse me.

793
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,824
This is about recycling.

794
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,117
Okay.

795
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,662
Hello.

796
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,954
It's about recycling.

797
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,248
"Expert's Real Estate Agency"

798
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
You shouldn't park here.

799
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,800
I'm a town master here.

800
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,344
You're looking for a house?

801
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,929
Oh, no.

802
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,014
I'm here to find out something.

803
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm a reporter.

804
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,144
Oh.

805
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,979
You're a reporter?

806
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,857
What are you trying to find out?

807
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,986
42/7 Sejong-ro.
Do you know where it is?

808
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,738
Of course, I do.

809
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,573
So, what about that house?

810
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,910
I'm looking into the family
who lived here 25 years ago.

811
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,454
25 years?

812
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,206
That's too long ago.

813
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,709
I've lived here for only ten years.

814
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,627
That's right.

815
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,920
No one knows about them.

816
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:19,800
The whole street here was reconstructed,
so the places here are all new.

817
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,263
What are you investigating?

818
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,664
Who's there? Hold on.

819
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,208
What's up?

820
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,334
Hello.

821
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,044
I'm Lee Giseok, an SBC reporter.

822
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,135
Oh, I don't like reporters.

823
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,261
Go away.

824
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,804
It's not about you, Mr. Lee.

825
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,518
I'm here to ask you about that house.

826
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,979
What about that house?

827
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,856
25 years ago,

828
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,567
you were in charge of the case
that happened there, right?

829
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,195
Is it because of the election?

830
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,405
It's like

831
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,365
a hidden card.

832
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,493
I have nothing to tell you.

833
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,394
Hong Euna has an alibi.

834
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,688
She was in the U.S.
on the day of Cho's death.

835
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,694
What's up with him?

836
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,741
I don't know.

837
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,953
All that we know

838
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,455
is that Cho Sunggu
blackmailed Choi and Hong.

839
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,873
I found it out!

840
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,210
Those two are accomplices.

841
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,962
The forensic result is out.

842
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,129
We found deleted texts

843
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,673
between Choi and Cho.

844
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,558
 <i>Let's stop it here.</i>

845
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,601
 <i>We made it twice.</i>

846
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,145
- <i>Just one more time.</i>
-  <i>It's dangerous.</i>

847
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,064
<i>I'll let you out after this.</i>

848
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,232
<i>Where's the USB?</i>

849
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,109
<i>Somewhere only I can open.</i>

850
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,277
USB?

851
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,029
USB.

852
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,242
Now, it makes sense.

853
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,496
Cho blackmailed Choi
for embezzlement.

854
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,831
But Choi had no money,

855
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,417
so he blackmailed patients
using their information.

856
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,085
And one of them got mad at him

857
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,296
and killed Cho Sunggu.

858
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,672
Choi was scared

859
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,215
and hid in an empty office.

860
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,759
To find out who was mad at him,

861
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,763
we need to find that USB first.

862
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,768
Why?

863
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,106
What?

864
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,025
Let's go.

00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,181
They're in here.

872
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,896
They didn't seal it properly.

873
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,889
The criminal came back to the scene--

874
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,796
Come on.

875
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,548

I was chasing the criminal.

895
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,434
Call me later.

896
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,564
You saw him?

897
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,191
He was hiding in Cho's house.

898
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,692
- I got him.
- Are you insane?

899

What?

900
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,530
You could've died.

901
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,368
- I was holding the life line.
- What if you missed it?

902
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,203
You didn't even ride it properly.

903
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,205
I had no other way

904
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,541
- to catch him.
-  It's not about him.

905
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,461
You're too reckless.

906

You still don't get it?

907
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,882
I just...

908
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,899
Take him to the interview room.
