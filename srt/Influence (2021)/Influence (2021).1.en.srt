00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,340
Ms. Oikawa, have you decided on the theme of your next series?

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm still thinking.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,010
Why not do something dramatic so we can make it into a movie?

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,840
You know that's not my principle.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,630
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,390
Oh, right.

15
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,520
Here are the materials you asked for.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,190
And... I brought your fan letters we received.

17
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,630
One of them wants to meet you, but don't worry about it.

18
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,670
- Someone wants to meet me?
- Yes.

19
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,870

She thinks her life is so interesting that she wants you to novelize it. We get that often.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,680
It's usually not very interesting.

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640

Yes. Nice to meet you.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,120
Certainly.

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,420
I didn't think you would agree to meet me.

34
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,610
There surely are a lot of people who ask me to hear their life story

35
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,350
I usually turn down that kind of request.

36
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,980
But you don't want to talk about your life story.

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,210
It's about you and your friends, right?

38
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,960
Many of your work is about the relationship between women.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,120
So, I thought you would be interested.

40
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,920
You said in the letter that one of your friends has pancreatic cancer.

41
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,620
- Is it true?
- Yes.

42
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,470
That's why I wanted to meet you as soon as possible.

43
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,770
Before she passes away.

44
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,440
Even if you are asking me to write a novel about it, I can't promise anything.

45
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm an entertainment novelist and I only write fiction.

46
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,830

Please.

49
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,160
As I wrote in the letter, what I'd like to talk about

50
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,490
is the relationship I've had with

51
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,570

killed someone.

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,490
It all started when we were 16 years old.

55
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,350
Back then...

56
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,700

I've never seen a person who makes fresh juice at home.

104
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,890
Store-bought juice has additives, so...

I hear you've been hanging out with the girl who moved into Building 2.

106

Mrs. Eguchi next door saw you two together.

Did you visit her place?

108
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,990
I did. Why?

109
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,560
I bet their furniture looked expensive.

110
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,470
How do you know?

111
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,890
Mrs. Yoshikawa in Building 2 told me.

112
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,960
She saw movers were carrying gorgeous furniture when they moved in.

113
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
I told you that, right?

114
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,710
What? They are rich?

115
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,780
Well, it's just the mother and the child.

116
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,340
Her husband was the president of a company in Tokyo,

117
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,490
but she came back to her hometown after the divorce.

118
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,150
I heard she got a large amount of alimony.

119
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,090
I guess the reason for the divorce was the husband's affair.

120
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,790
It's just a rumor, right? Don't say that.

121
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,790
She said so herself.

122
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,810
She was giving out expensive sweets to her neighbors when she moved in.

123
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,220
And told them she was getting a lot of child support payment.

124
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,670
She brought in expensive furniture to show off,

125
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,660
but she lives in this shabby complex after all.

126
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,590
It's good to be the same, Yuri.

127

People look at you with curious eyes when you stand out.

128
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,150

Why did you come to our school?

138
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,770
You could have gone to a better school.

139
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,880
I wanted to go to a school within walking distance.

140
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I was groped on the train before.

141
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,630
I had so many lessons after school before I moved here.

142
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,230
English, piano, and ballet.

143
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,630
I liked ballet, so I didn't want to quit.

- At the park.

147
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,900
You saw me practicing ballet, right?

148
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,070
It was beautiful.

149
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,040
I was happy.

150
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,390
My mom doesn't like to admit defeat.

151
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,730
She has her hands full protecting her pride,

152
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,370
and she can't care about my feelings.

153
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,390
So, I have to fight on my own.

154
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,280
I don't want to change myself because others don't accept me for who I am.

155
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,480
I don't want my fate to get the best of me.

156

I heard your mother got a job.

159
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,300
It must be hard for her since she'd been a stay-at-home mom.

<i>It's good to be the same...</i>

164
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,310
I guess what my mother was trying to say was

165
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,920
you can't be accepted otherwise.

166
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,140
I understand.

167
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,330
It's not limited to housing complexes and schools.

168
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,400
In such closed communities,

169
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,550
people try to eliminate those who are different.

170
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,870
But I think Maho was lucky.

171
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,430
Because you had the courage to talk to her.

172
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,700
That's not it.

173
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,110
I talked to her instead of turning away from her,

174
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,810
because I had regrets.

175
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,410
Regrets?

176
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,160
Once before,

177
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,330
I had abandoned my friend

178
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,820
and left her to die.

179
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,730
That is my other friend.

180
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,640
Satoko.

181
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,300
- I feel sorry for him.
- I know, right?

182
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,800
They're bullying someone again.

183
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,230
Do you know her?

184
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,160
We grew up together in the same complex.

185
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,660
We used to play together when we were in elementary school.

186
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,410
<i> Pineapple.
<i>[October, 1975]</i></i>

187
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,290
<i>Ruby.</i>

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,350
<i>- Can I go to your place today, Yuri?
- Sure.</i>

189
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,920
<i>Oh, my mom said she would get me a cherry stick.</i>

190
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,780
<i>Yuri! Let's play together.</i>

191
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,650
<i>Welcome!</i>

192
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,430
<i>Yuri, Satoko is here.</i>

193
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,490
<i>What's wrong?</i>

194
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,100
<i>That's Yuri's grandpa. He's visiting us.</i>

195
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,150
<i>So, you are Satoko.</i>

196
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,030
<i>Thank you for being friends with</i>

197
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,300
<i>Yuri.</i>

198
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,120
<i>Are you sleeping here tonight?</i>

199
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,910
<i>Ah... Thank you, I will.</i>

200
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,360
<i>You are sleeping with your grandpa, Yuri?</i>

201
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,970
<i>Hm?</i>

202
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,290
<i>She's not sleeping with me.</i>

203
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,910
<i>When grandpa is staying, Yuri sleeps with me.</i>

204
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,490
<i>But girls are supposed to sleep with their grandpa.</i>

205
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,200
<i>Girls are?</i>

206
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,100
<i>Do you sleep with your grandpa, Satoko?</i>

207
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,060
<i>Because Mom said a girl should sleep with her grandpa.</i>

208
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,870
<i>Is that...</i>

209
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,090
<i>By sleeping with, do you mean in the same room?</i>

210
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,510
<i>Or in the same bed?</i>

211
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,200
<i>In the same bed.</i>

212
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,990
<i>Because girls sleep with their grandpas.</i>

213
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,730
<i>That's what I was told.</i>

214
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,900
<i>No way. You are overthinking.</i>

215
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,350
<i>But she repeated it many times.</i>

216
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,720
<i>Girls sleep with their grandpas.</i>

217
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,060
<i>That's weird, right?</i>

218
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,000
<i>The floor plan is the same as ours.</i>

219
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,320
<i>Satoko's parents and her little brother sleep in this room,</i>

220
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,490
<i>and she sleeps with her grandfather in the other room.</i>

221
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,120
<i>Why don't you ask her mother?</i>

222
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,480
<i>How am I supposed to ask her?</i>

223
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,630
<i>"I heard your daughter sleeps with her grandfather,</i>

224
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,360
<i>but is he doing something wrong to her?"</i>

225
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
<i>That's not good.</i>

226
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,250
<i>If I was wrong, it would cause trouble.</i>

227
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,480
<i>And if it was true, I wouldn't want to get involved.</i>

228
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,570
<i>Anyway, we should keep Yuri away from that girl.</i>

229
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,050
<i>It could be a bad influence on Yuri.</i>

230
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,080
<i>Listen.</i>

231
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,080
<i>Don't ever go to Satoko's place.</i>

232
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,180
<i>Even if she invites you, you have to say no.</i>

233
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,730
<i>If you want to play with her, stay here, or somewhere where adults are around.</i>

234
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,340
<i>Understood?</i>

235
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,260
<i>Oh, Yuri. Wait for a moment.</i>

236
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,930
<i>Auntie?</i>

237
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,280
<i>What is it?</i>

238
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,260
<i>Did Satoko cause you any trouble?</i>

239
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,590
<i>She's good for nothing.</i>

240
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,600
<i>Ah, Yu. What's the matter?</i>

241
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,130
<i>Yuri, what's the matter?</i>

242
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,700
I was unable to help her out, then...

243
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,500
I became estranged from Satoko.

244
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,810
But it wasn't your fault.

245
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,720
You were only an elementary student.

246
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,010
The people who forsook Satoko

247
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,970
were your parents and your grandfather.

248
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,610
I can't say I'm completely innocent.

249
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,650
Turning a blind eye is also a sin.

250
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,210
The most regrettable sin I've committed was...

251
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,640
that I left Satoko in the living hell.

252
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,790
And yet, I pretended to be her friend.

253
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,800
You, Maho, and Satoko...

254
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Did you say the three of you have killed someone?

255
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,570
That's right.

256
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,710
Do you mean...

257
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,210
did you actually commit murder?

258
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,150
Or, just like when you didn't help Satoko,

259
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,740
you killed (broke) someone's heart?

260
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:32,070
I came here to tell you the whole story.

261
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,330
After entering high school,

262
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,380
Satoko and I didn't speak at all.

263
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,050
But I was still worried about her.

264
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,220
<i>Back then, my high school was known for being notorious.</i>

265
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,060
That hurts. Get out my way, ugly.

266
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,300
Geez, that was mean.

267
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,160
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,140
- Satoko.
- What is it?

269
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,680
- Do you have any plans after school?
- I'm free.

270
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,160
Then we should go somewhere.

271
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,140
Sure!  As long as you're buying, Yoshie.

272
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,670
- How nice.
- What?

273
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,240
My treat?

274
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,910
You, come with us.

275
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,580
I know you've been watching us.

276
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,560
Just come with us.

277
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,690
Get out my way.

278
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,860
What are you looking at?

279
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,460
Here, have a drink.

280
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,220
- Come on.
- No, thanks.

281
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,580
Why not? Come on.

282
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,190
Are you okay?

283
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,480
Bring me one, too.

284
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Satoko...

285
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,360
Why did you come here?

286
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,970
Satoko, let's go home.

287
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,490
Are you dating that guy?

288
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,750
He comes in handy.

289
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,650
He's familiar with the yakuza and good at fighting.

290
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,720
Nobody can touch me as long as I'm with him.

291
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,610
You haven't told anyone about that, have you?

292
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,330
What?

293
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,800
About my grandpa. Remember?

294
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,150
I haven't.

295
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,990
I'll kill you if you do.

296
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,030
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

297
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,260
Hey, wait!

298
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,660
Just let her go.

299
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,830
Leave the loser alone.

300
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,130
<i>Please ask your student about it.</i>

301
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,820
<i>Understood. I know they haven't been talking much lately.</i>

302
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,780
<i>- But I will ask her.
- Please do.</i>

303
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,310
- I just got the confirmation.
<i> - Oh, good.</i>

304
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,190
Yuri!

305
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,690
What is going on? The teachers seem agitated.

306
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,350
Rinako might die.

307
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,210
- What?
- Ogata and his gang attacked her.

308
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,550
<i>Let me do it.</i>

309
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,390
<i>I will win for sure.</i>

310
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,140
<i>I don't think you would.</i>

311
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,720
<i>- Ouch!
- What have you done?</i>

312
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,060
<i>- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?</i>

313
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,130
<i>Hey, stand up.</i>

314
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,740
<i>- Hey, what are you guys doing?
- Who the heck are you?</i>

315
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,880
<i>- What?
- Are you bullying a girl?</i>

316
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,830
<i>- Shut up!
- Hey.</i>

317
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,090
<i>Stop it.</i>

318
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,690
<i>You really piss me off.</i>

319
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,630
She was there when that happened.

320
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,030
Ogata's girlfriend...

321
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,600
<i>Does it hurt? I know it does.</i>

322
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,250
It's unforgivable.

323
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,770
<i>A group of male students assaulted a girl who goes to the same high school.</i>

324
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,160
<i>She is in a critical condition and still unconscious.</i>

325
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,690
<i>During the police investigation, a 17-year-old main suspect admitted to the crime.</i>

326
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,550
<i>The police arrested the group of male students...</i>

327
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,160
Is it true Satoko was there, too?

328
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,820
Who knows?

329
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,630
Do you mean the Satoko we know of?

330
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,530
It's her.

331
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,590
She has gone to the bad and became a member of a gang.

332
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,450
That's a given considering her family situation.

333
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,790
<i>[Fuji HIkari Complex Map]</i>

334
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,450
Did you hear about yesterday?

335
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,260
Isn't that Satoko?

336
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,520
<i>She was a cutie when she was younger.</i>

337
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,000
Satoko!

338
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,730
Why didn't you stop them?

339
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,520
I didn't hit her.

340
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,330
But you know, she almost died.

341
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,090
Wait, Satoko.

342
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,030
Then, why didn't you stop him?

343
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,370
You knew what that old geezer was doing to me.

344
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,630
But you didn't stop him.

345
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,970
That girl was bullied, but nobody offered to help her out.

346
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,530
<i>Since your pen case is full of germs, I'll disinfect it for you.</i>

347
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,260
<i>So funny. My goodness.</i>

348
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,960
Who is worse, you or me?

349
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,290
Don't you get it?

350
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,090
In this hellish world that we live in,

351
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,960
nobody dares to help us.

352
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,490
That's only an excuse.

353
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,260
You know, what Ogata did was more cruel than bullying.

354
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:42,250
As Satoko said, I didn't stop them either.

355
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,670
I'm Rinako's friend, for goodness’ sake.

356
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,090
You haven't done anything wrong.

357
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,260
You shouldn't listen to that girl.

358
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,430
She's trying to shift the responsibilities by justifying her wrongdoing.

359
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,390
Don't talk bad about Satoko.

360
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,070
Sorry.

361
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,590
I'm sorry, too.

362
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,190
She's your childhood friend, isn't she?

363
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,560
I should go now.

364
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,750
I should be home before my mom does.

365
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,580
Auntie, I'm leaving now. Thank you for having me.

366
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,590
You are? Stay safe, okay?

367
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,730
- I will. Thank you for the dinner.
- Sure.

368
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,460
Maho!

369
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,380
I'll walk you home.

370
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,230
Don't.

371
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,570
I'm sorry about earlier.

372
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,250
I know you meant well.

373
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,790
It's my fault that Satoko turned out like that.

374
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,470
What? What do you mean?

375
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,930
You don't need to tell me.

376
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,750
Whatever the relationship you have with her, I'm still your friend.

377
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,060
Thanks.

378
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,720
You should go back now.

379
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,940
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Yup. Good night.

380
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,520

381
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,220

- Come here.</i>

382
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,710
Are you okay?

383
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,750
You!

384
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,530
Let her go.

385
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,800
Yuri!

386
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,980
Yuri...

387
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,910
Yuri!

388
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,450
Let's leave. It's self-defense.

389
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,700
Yuri, just go home.

390
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,690

391
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,680
Were you too busy chatting?

392
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,810
I told you to come back home right away.

393
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,350
- We had a lot to talk.
- Take a bath.

394
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,900
Wait, Yuri!

395
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,120
You have a tear.

396
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,630
Were you being rough again? Be more gentle since you're a girl.

397
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,560
Yuri, wake up!

398
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Yuri! Yuri!

399
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,220
Listen carefully.

400
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,470
Last night, a man was murdered at the park.

401
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,400
I hear...

402
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,930
Satoko was the murderer.

403
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,950
She turned herself into the police.

404
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:51,570
He tried to attack me with a knife.

405
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,180
Accidentally, I stabbed him.

406
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,810
- Contact the Juvenile Justice Department.
- Yes, Sir.

407
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,500
Miss...

408
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,790
Then I realized,

409
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,840
the window in Satoko's room

410
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,660
faced the park where I stabbed the man.

411
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,040
I assume Satoko was watching us from her room.

412
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,340
She took the rap for me.

Yes?

416
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,710
I'm sorry for talking so long.

417
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,470
Can we meet tomorrow again?

418
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,910
Are you sure?

419
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,820
Let's meet up here at the same time tomorrow.

420
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,570
Sure.

421
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:08,550
Can you tell me Maho and Satoko's surname?

422
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,050
I wrote these down for you.
