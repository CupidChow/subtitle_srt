00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,240
<i>So you're a detective.</i>

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,020
<i>I believe she has an accomplice.</i>

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,960
<i>The police? I told you not to contact me.</i>

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,110
<i>You said you were a victim of domestic violence. You deceived me.</i>

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,380
<i>Killing an abusive man doesn't hurt your conscience as much.</i>

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,690
<i>The man I killed was Satoko's husband.</i>

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,220
<i>I was more devastated by Maho deceiving me.</i>

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,270
<i>You two used me.</i>

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,590
<i>I've been watching over you.</i>

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>That has led to another tragedy.</i>

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,040
<i>Where were you that night?</i>

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,530
<i>We'll be stuck in an endless loop.</i>

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,790

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,770
<i>Yuri Totsuka has passed away.</i>

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,450

<i>[March 2019, Tokyo]</i>

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,340
She was staying at home till she passed away.

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,450
Is this Yuri Totsuka?

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,800
She had pancreatic cancer.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,500
Pancreatic cancer?

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,650
She passed away three years ago.

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,260
<i>You mentioned in your letter</i>

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,630
<i>that one of your friends was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</i>

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,040
<i>That's right. That's why I was urged to meet you.</i>

29

<i>The real Yuri Totsuka had pancreatic cancer.</i>

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,610
<i>And she has passed away.</i>

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,300
<i>After learning that fact, I decided to listen to the rest of her story.</i>

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,460
Good afternoon.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,150
Good afternoon, Ms. Totsuka.

<i>The woman who claims to be Yuri Totsuka...</i>

35

<i>I'm curious to find out her true identity and her motive.</i>

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,880
I've been coming here a lot.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,960
Yes, you have.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,150
I think I can tell you the rest of the story today.

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,470
Maho and Satoko tricked me

40
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,090
into killing Satoko's husband.

41
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,430
This is where we left off last time.

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,300
Right.

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,780
Satoko had suffered from domestic violence.

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,670
She had you kill her husband,

45
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,010
and she was living with her ex-boyfriend, Ogata.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,410
You said that led to a tragedy.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
That's right.

48
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,350
Did someone else die?

49
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,910
On that day,

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,830
<i>I left her apartment without seeing her.</i>

51
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,420
<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>- Go in.
- Thanks.</i>

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,770
<i>Then I went on a date with Mr. Natsume.</i>

54
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,760
A date?

55
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,390
I've never been on a date...

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,130
to simply enjoy tea or take a walk at a park.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,140
An ordinary date as such.

58
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,670

<i>[November 1994]</i>

We've only seen each other at night,

61
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,520

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,110
<i>I called you several times on the night of the murder.</i>

68
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,780
<i>But you never picked up.</i>

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,670
<i>You mentioned before</i>

70
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,720
<i>that you have two friends who are precious to you.</i>

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>Who are your friends?</i>

72
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,490
I'm sorry for showing up drunk.

73
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,760
The case hasn't been solved yet, has it?

74
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,130
Not yet.

75
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,290
Did you investigate the case today, too?

76
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,360
We should go home now.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,040

<i>Nothing is going on. I just called to see how you were doing.</i>

81
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,290
Listen, I have a pain in my lower back.

82
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,250
I went to a chiropractor that Mrs. Yamada recommended.

83
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,310
How was the treatment?

84
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,440
<i>It was really good.</i>

85
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
<i>He adjusted my bones to a proper position.</i>

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,900
<i>Yuri, you should take care of your body now,</i>

87
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,080
<i>so you won't have aches and pains when you're older.</i>

88

Mom, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,930
Huh? What for?

90
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,730
Honey, you should stop drinking beer.

91
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,300
<i>Honey, geez.</i>

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,980
<i>You and Dad, take care of your health. Okay?</i>

93
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,100
Oh, sorry. What was that?

94
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,670
Honey, you're drinking too much.

95
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,370
No, it's nothing.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,800
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

97
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,110
<i>Here. Go ahead.</i>

98
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,960
<i>I've noticed we live in the same complex and go to the same high school.</i>

99
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,290
<i>Yuri, you didn't laugh at me.</i>

100
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,130
<i>And it made me happy.</i>

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,520
<i>We used to play here often when we were younger.</i>

102
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,230
<i>I've been watching over you, Yuri.</i>

103
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,640
<i>Those friends are precious to you, right?</i>

104
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,610
<i>If so, they're still your friends,</i>

105
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,670
<i>even if you can't see them or how they think of you.</i>

106
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,820
<i>Friends have a special place in your heart.</i>

107
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,180

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,490

Hello?

111
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,130
Yuri.

112
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,120
What's the matter? If you call my house,

113
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,940
the police might suspect us.

114
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,330
The police came by and asked about you this morning,

115
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,590
if we had kept in touch or not.

116
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,330
Is that a detective named Natsume?

117
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,970
How do you know?

118
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,370
Did he visit you, too?

119
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,040
Don't worry.

120
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,190
I didn't tell him a thing.

121
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,420
<i>I'm worried.</i>

122
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,500
Listen, Yuri. Just mention my name if the situation worsens.

123
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,510
<i>Tell them I forced you into this.</i>

124
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,390
<i>Yuri, are you listening?</i>

125
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,910
I was about to kill myself earlier.

126
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,940
But if I die,

127
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,740
I won't be able to protect you and Satoko.

128
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,530
I realize that now.

129
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,220
I must protect the two of you,

130
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,480
because you two are my friends.

131
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,360
<i>[INFLUENCE]
[Final Episode]</i>

132
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,400
You still thought of them as friends...

133
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,810
even after they used you and manipulated you.

134
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,440
From an objective point of view, it may sound crazy.

135
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,930
There were a few others with who I was friends.

136
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,860
However, there was a wall around my heart.

137
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,100
I didn't open my heart to anyone

138
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:39,240
except Maho and Satoko.

139
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,770
That's why I thought...

140
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,430
I can't get arrested.

141
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,750
Am I a suspect?

142
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,920
You asked me where I was on the night of the murder.

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,350
Acutally, I was at home.

144
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,700
But I didn't answer your call,

145
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,880
because I was scared to fall further in love with you.

146
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,040
Is Maho Sakazaki a friend you mentioned?

147
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,760
Yes.

148
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,360
So is Satoko Hino.

149
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,350
She's my childhood friend.

150
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,200
I didn't tell you the truth, because I had a feeling

151
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,710
that Satoko might have killed her abusive husband.

152
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,820
I didn't want you to be biased against Satoko.

153
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,920
That's why I didn't mention her name.

154
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,860
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,790
<i>If I keep lying to him, he will suspect us even more.</i>

156
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,080
My role is to play a caring girl who is worried about her friends.

157
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,130
Does the police think Satoko is the murderer?

158
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,780
Don't worry. Satoko has an alibi.

159
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,130
On the day of the murder, Satoko Hino

160
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,260
visited her parents with her daughter.

161
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,490
Is that right?

162
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,360
What a relief.

163
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,230
Mr. Natsume, I want to help you with the investigation.

164
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,500
You must catch the killer.

165
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,360
I want to prove Maho's innocence.

166
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,280
Let me ask you one thing.

167
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,200
Were Maho and Satoko close in high school?

168
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
No.

169
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,230
I believe they've never even talked to each other.

170
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,550
If she was the suspect,

171
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,020
she would have been taken into custody.

172
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,260
So I knew his suspicion was entirely based on his personal opinion.

173
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,980
All I had to do was to not let our secret be exposed.

174
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,390
That's what I thought at the time.

175
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,260
At the time?

176
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,830
But I was wrong.

177
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,560
I was wrong about the whole thing?

178
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,890
Whole thing?

179
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,320
I didn't really know

between the three of us.

182

<i>Ms. Totsuka!</i>

183
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,240
Ms. Totsuka, I heard you know a man named Ayumu Ogata.

184
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,320
Yes, I do.

185
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,090
Was Ogata...

186
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,890
in a romantic relationship with Hino after she got married?

187
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,590
I'm not sure.

188
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,460
I see.

189
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,490
Please excuse me.

190
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,130
Did something happen to Ogata?

191
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,870
We found out that Ogata visits Satoko's apartment often.

192
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,970
Apparently, they seem to be dating.

193
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,630
Don't tell me... the police think Ogata is involved in the case?

194
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,590
Is he the one who killed Satoko's husband?

195
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,630
Ogata has a motive to kill him.

196
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,690
The woman he loves being physically abused by her husband.

197
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,440
Is something wrong?

198
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,560
Not at all.

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,790
How do you know I live here?

201
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,120
The police came by today

202
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,530
and asked me about your relationship with Ogata.

203
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,130
- What?
- They are suspecting Ogata.

204
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,260
Does he have an alibi?

205
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,700
An alibi?

206
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
An alibi on the day of the murder.

207
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,000
If the police falsely accuse him as the murderer,

208
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,510
they might suspect you, too, Satoko.

209
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,160
Hold on. What are you talking about?

210
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,860
Wait! Do you know...

211
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,060
my husband was murdered?

212
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,320
What?

213
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,660
Did Maho tell you that?

214
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,730
I told her not to tell you.

215
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,760
Not to tell me?

216
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,780
But your husband... I...

217
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,300
What is it, Yuri?

218
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,980
Satoko, don't you know?

219
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,430

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,610

221
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,890
Can you take her?  She fell asleep on the way back.

<i>This is Yoriko. She'll turn three next month.</i>

223
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,980
<i>She's shy around people.</i>

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,550
Oh my. Let's put you down to sleep.

225
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,490
Is she your daughter, Satoko?

226
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,730
Yes, she is.

227
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,170
Yuri, come on in.

228
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,150

Coming.

233
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,440
Wait. It could be the police.

234
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,230
Coming.

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,370
What brings you here?

236
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,090
Hey, don't hurt her.

237
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,120

No!

Ayumu!

- Ogata!
- Ayumu.

241
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,280
- Ayumu.
- He was stabbed by the man who just run off.

242

- Please call for a backup.
- I'm on it.

He died.

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,860
His stab wound was fatal.

246
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,260
He got himself in trouble when he left the yakuza group.

247
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,730
The detective said he was killed as a warning to others.

248
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,520
Maho,

249
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,960
Satoko didn't know that I killed her husband.

250
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,420
I never thought you planned the whole thing alone,

251
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,840
in order to protect Satoko and her daughter

252
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,880
from the abusive husband.

253
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,550
So that Satoko...

254
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,880
could be with Ogata again.

255
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,440
But why?

256
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,260
You weren't exactly on good terms with Satoko.

257
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,760
Satoko suddenly came to visit me a year ago.

258
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,420
Her husband beat her up and refused to pay for any living expenses,

259
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,980
so she didn't even have money to feed her daughter.

260
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,860
And she came to threaten me.

261
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,290
Do you remember this, don't you?

262
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,210
It's the evidence of you killing my grandfather.

263
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,830
If the secret is exposed, you won't be able to live such a luxurious life.

264
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,330
You haven't changed at all.

265
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,580
If you need my help, just say so.

266
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,970
I'm not asking for your help.

267
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
What is your name?

268
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,650
I couldn't let her daughter suffer.

269
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,490
Since then, I looked after her while Satoko worked at a hostess bar.

270
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:03,490
I'll always be with you whenever your mom is absent.

271
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,370
- Always?
- That's right. Always.

272
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,750
It's a promise.

273
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,910
What do you think? It's an apartment I inherited from my father.

274
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Are you letting me rent this place?

275
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,920
Your husband doesn't give you any living expenses, right?

276
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,610
Since it's scheduled to be demolished in six months,

277
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,250
you can live here for free till then.

278
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,500

279
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,860

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,510
Shall we play?

281
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,110
I'll leave her in your care.

282
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,090
Wait.

283
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,190
Why not divorce your husband?

284
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,720
Isn't he involved in a risky business?

285
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,100
He could get arrested anytime.

286
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,100
I've tried to leave him, but he refused to get a divorce.

287
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,910
Satoko?

288
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm going to leave the syndicate.

289
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,150
I'll find a way to quit, so you should leave your husband, too.

290
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,460
I'll take care of you and Yoriko.

291
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,780
I'll make you two happy.

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,650
<i>Unless you don't care about what happens to Yoriko.</i>

298
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,690
<i>I said, stop crying!</i>

299
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,800
She was afraid he might hurt Yoriko.

300
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,090
That's why she couldn't just leave him.

301
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:36,560
Is that why you decided to kill her husband

302
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,880
without Satoko knowing?

303
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,560
No matter how worthless he was,

304
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,930
he was the father of Yoriko.

305
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,390
I couldn't let her mother kill her father.

306
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,990
Why didn't you tell me your intention?

307
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,440
You should've been honest about Satoko being abused from the beginning.

308
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,420
Satoko told me to keep it a secret from you.

309
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,890
She didn't come to see you, did she?

310
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,730
I bet she pretended to be happy with her married life.

311
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,620
<i>He's much older than me, but he's loaded and treats me well.</i>

312
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,360
<i>She was totally worn out physically and emotionally.</i>

313
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,830
<i>But she dressed up in the clothes I lent her...</i>

314
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,420
She always said that she didn't want to worry you.

315
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,020
<i>You and I shouldn't meet anymore.</i>

316
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:51,980
We've always helped each other.

317
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,060
We fought and sacrificed ourselves for our friendship.

318
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,000
That's why I did it.

319
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,340
I was sure Satoko was going to be happy after her husband's death.

320
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,360
Everything was going to be great.

321
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,030
But now...

Don't worry. I won't mention your name, Maho.

The incident in the past and this time...

333
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,770
those weren't your fault, Maho.

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,040
I see.

359
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,250
May I speak to her in private?

360
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,890
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,450
I still believe you didn't act single-handedly.

362
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,300
If you don't speak up the truth now,

363
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,520
you'll be held accountable for the crime.

364
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,870
I already told you the truth.

365
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,000
I know I shouldn't be telling you this.

366
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,510
But I was falling in love with you.

367
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,230
I'm sorry.

368
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,080
<i>Stand up.</i>

369
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,760
<i>According to the police report, you told the police,</i>

370
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,370
<i>you haven't kept in contact with the defendant for six years.</i>

371
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,860
That's right.

372
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,650
<i>But the truth is, you've contacted the defendant before the murder,</i>

373
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,400
<i>and told her about the victim's wife suffering from her husband's violence.</i>

374
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,830
<i>Why did you lie to the police?</i>

375
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,260
Because Ms. Totsuka asked me not to say.

376
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,250
Fine.

377
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,130
If you're turing yourself in, then I will, too.

378
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,560
You can't.

379
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,720
You promised Yoriko that you'd always be with her.

380
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,320
If she finds out her favorite auntie was involved

381
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,050
in her father's murder, she may feel hostile toward you.

382
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:20,020
I want to show her the world where she can trust grown-ups.

383
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,720
Were you aware that the defendant murdered the victim?

384
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,700
No.

385
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,050
I assumed she had her reason,

386
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,080
but I'd never thought it was related to the murder case.

387
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,960
No further questions.

388
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,780
What were your thoughts when you heard the defendant killed your husband?

389
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,460
I was shocked, but...

390
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,190
I wasn't surprised at the same time.

391
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,210
Why is that?

392
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,590
Because Yuri is always worried about me.

393
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,500
I have no more questions.

394
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,230
Um... may I say something?

395
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,720
You may.

396
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,450
I...

397
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,820
made many mistakes in my life.

398
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,770
I blamed it on others

399
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,100
and I gave up on myself.

400
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,910
<i>What's so different between you and me?</i>

401
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,130
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

402
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,020
<i>In this damned world we live in,</i>

403
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,890
<i>no one is going to help us.</i>

404
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,910
But I won't make the same mistake again.

405
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,860
<i>Satoko, I remember you said,</i>

406
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:10,590
<i>no one is going to help us in this damned world.</i>

407
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,580
<i>I wanted to free you from a living hell.</i>

408
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,670
<i>I wanted you to know the world has more to offer.</i>

409
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,750
The world I live in...

410
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,120
isn't a living hell.

411
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,000
I'll keep that in mind...

412
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,170
and live a happy life.

413
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,940
<i>The statute of limitations for murder is fifteen years.</i>

414
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,960
<i>After fifteen years,</i>

415
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,320
<i>let's go there.</i>

416
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,100
<i>We'll be nomads and walk around looking for grass to feed our sheep.</i>

417
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,100
<i>Did you kill him? But why?</i>

418
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,640
<i>It doesn't matter who does it.</i>

419
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,760
<i>No one has to know it, as long as we accomplish the task.</i>

420
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,790
<i>I did it because I knew I could finish the task.</i>

421
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,680
<i>Now I can protect you, Yuri.</i>

422
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,920
<i>We've committed a crime we should never have.</i>

423
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>But it ends now.</i>

424
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,290
<i>Let's forget the whole thing, and find our own happiness.</i>

425
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:33,460
<i>We must live a happy life.</i>

426
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,950
<i>If not, everything we've done will be meaningless.</i>

427
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,540
<i>We must live a happy life.</i>

428
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,880
I now deliver the verdict.

429
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,180
Defendant, please approach the stand.

430
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,510
<i>The court sentences the defendant to fifteen years in prison.</i>

431
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,420
<i>100 days in the pre-sentencing detention will be included time served toward the sentence.</i>

432
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,300
<i>The sentence...</i>

433
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,360
<i>[April 2019]</i>

434
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,160
Sorry to have you come all the way here.

435
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,770
It's fine, but why did you want to meet me here?

436
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,340
I wanted to talk to you here for the last time.

437
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:09,120
I was a student of this high school, too.

438
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,250
What?

439
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,450
You didn't know?

440
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,480
I didn't know.

441
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,180
Did we attend the same high school?

442
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,650
We were in the same grade, too.

443
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,680
Just like you and Yuri Totsuka.

444
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,420
Please tell me...

445
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,230
why you pretended to be Yuri Totsuka.

446
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,810
This is the real Yuri Totsuka, isn't it?

447
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,370
She died of pancreatic cancer three years ago.

448
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,610
And this...

449
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,670
When I met up with Yuri's parents, they told me...

450
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,520
The person on the left is Satoko.

451
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,550
The person on the right is you.

452
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:32,030
You must be Maho Sakazaki. Am I right?

453
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,330
Right before her passing,

454
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,260
she gave this to me.

455
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:03,750
It contains her autobiography-like story that she wrote.

456
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:10,950
It's the same story that I told you.

457
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:18,630
It's been three years since Yuri's death.

458
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,350
And I was finally able to sort out my feelings.

459
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:29,210
I want to make something special out of what she left behind.

460
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,900
Is that why you contacted me?

461
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,750
Yuri had many books of yours.

462
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,640
So I thought she was a fan of yours.

463
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,340
Or maybe she knew you attended the same high school

464
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,020
and was rooting for you.

465
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,340
You may be right.

466
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,420
I'm sorry for keeping you in suspense.

467
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,910
My intention was to arouse your curiosity.

468
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:10,960
Pretending to be Yuri was part of your act?

469
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:20,260
I wanted to feel how Yuri felt when she wrote this.

470
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:29,670
I wanted to deliver the message from Yuri's standpoint.

471
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:38,140
The three of us joined our hands and supported each other.

472
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:00,600
I came to give you this.

473
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,950
Thank you.

00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,680
Yuri would be happy.

478
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,360
I have one last question.

479
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,430
Why is this phrase so special to you?

480
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,940
This...

481
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,620
Are you the one who came up with the phrase?

482
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,670
No, someone told me a long ago.

483
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,430
I told a person in high school that my dream was to be a novelist.

484
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,890
In high school?

485
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:51,720
As an aspiring writer, I was distressed over the uncertainty of my further career.

486
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,380
That's when I remembered this phrase.

487
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,820
What a coincidence.

488
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,930
Pardon?

489
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,030
This phrase...

490
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,180
Yuri used to tell me often.

491
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,190
"Maho, you're strong-willed and a hard worker.

492
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:18,220
If you set your mind to it, you can do anything."

493

497
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,750
<i>Don't say that.</i>

498
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,660
<i>I must be crazy for writing a story all the time.</i>
