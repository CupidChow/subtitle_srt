68

and the case was closed as an accidental death.

69
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,260
Did Maho want to return you a favor...

70
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,040
because you saved her from the man's attack?

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,090
I guess that's one of the reasons.

72
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,930

Before I got to your house,

131
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,050
your grandfather accidentally fell from the window.

132
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,510
I'm not sure how it happened.

133
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:49,710
So you don't owe me anything. It was a mere accident.

134

An accident?

135
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,630
He was punished by Heaven.

136
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,740

Maho?

151

Did Satoko call you over here, too?

152
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,760
Yes. She called my parents. She called you too?

153
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,800
Right. I wonder what her ulterior motive is?

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,850
The other day?

157
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,130
Did you two meet up recently?

158
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,050
Did you know Yuri didn't kill my grandfather?

159
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,400
I haven't told Maho yet.

160
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,730
Yuri said it was an accident. But I don't get it.

161
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,640
If it was truly divine punishment,

162
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,090
he should have been dead long ago.

163
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,830
The police determined his death was accidental.

164
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,410
I found this in the room on that day.

165
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,380
I thought it belonged to Yuri, so I concealed it.

166
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,640
Since it wasn't, it must be yours.

167
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,680
Only the three of us knew the plan.

168
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,420
This is so-called divine punishment.

169
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,210
If I take it to the police, they might find your fingerprints.

170
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,700
- Wait, Satoko.
- I just thought...

171
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,590
it was too risky for Yuri since she failed once.

172
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,520
Maho.

173
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,120
Your wish came true. Why are you complaining now?

174
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,160
Are you threatening me?

175
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,650
That would be a good idea.

176
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,940
I know about your rich father.

177
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,660
Yuri was willing to fight for you.

178
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,020
That's why I helped her. Is there something wrong with that?

179
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,360
Maho, stop it.

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,760
You wanted Yuri to save you, didn't you?

181
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,350
It's all because she saved me once.

182
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,590
You were envious of me, right?

183
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,730
Stop that!

184
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,120
Satoko isn't our enemy.

185
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,150
Satoko,

186
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,990
do you know why I'd decided to help you?

187
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,640
It wasn't because you threatened me.

188
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,090
You told me once,

189
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,230
nobody is going to help us in this cruel world.

190
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,610
I wanted to free you from a living hell.

191
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,640
Because I wanted you to know the world had a lot more to offer.

192
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,840
Maho helped because she empathized with my intention.

193
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,110
Maho...

194
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,910
Satoko...

195
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,020
We've committed a crime that we should never have.

196
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,030
But it ends now. Let's forget the whole thing and find our own happiness.

197
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,220
We must live a happy life.

198
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,860
Otherwise, we did all these things for nothing.

199
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,090
Let's be happy, okay?

200
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,960
Don't you ever lie to me again.

201
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,520
I'll keep this with me.

202
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,130
Sorry. I shouldn't have told her that.

203
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,120
You know...

204
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,060
I left home.

205
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,750
I want to make it on my own. Not the life predetermined by my mother.

206
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,570
I see.

207
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,770
I believe in you, Maho.

208
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,390
Yuri, if Satoko threatens me again,

209
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,640
will you kill Satoko for me?

210
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,950
Kill Satoko?

211
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,410
When you said you've killed one more person,

212
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,330
did you mean Satoko?

213
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,920
What does your intuition tell you?

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,890
The next murder occurred six years later.

215
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,580
After I got a job and moved to Tokyo.

216
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,620
<i>[October 1994, Tokyo]</i>

217
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,150
Yes, this is it!

218
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,760
I can't believe it!

219
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,990
<i>Oops, this is your fault.</i>

220
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,550
Excuse me. Where can I find this book?

221
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,610
I'm sorry.

222
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,790
This book is out of stock now.

223
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,100
What?

224
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,340
Do you know that without looking up?

225
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,910
I do.

226
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,820
I see.

227
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,690
<i>Excuse me.</i>

228
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,530
<i>Can you check to see if the book is in stock?</i>

229
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,280
<i>One moment, please.</i>

230
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,530
I've asked another worker to confirm.

231
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,020
She said it is out of stock.

232
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,600
I know.

233
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,690
I'm sorry for doubting you.

234
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,030
It's fine.

235
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,440
I thought you were blowing me off because you were too lazy to confirm it yourself.

236
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
I've never thought you'd be aware of the entire stock.

237
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,290
Not exactly.

238
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,450
I love the novelist's books.

239
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,560
That's how I knew it was out.

240
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,270
- Oh, I get it now.
- I'm sorry

241
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,080
- for causing the misunderstanding.
- Not at all.

242
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,360
May I order the book?

243
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,810
Please fill out a request form there.

244
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,840
We'll contact you as soon as it comes in.

245
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,140
Are you the one who calls me?

246
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,140
I'll try this book.

247
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,850
Do you have any recommendations?

248
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,900
I really enjoyed this book.

249
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,520
Thank you.

250
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,590
<i>[The Knight in the Snow, Written by Reigo Hayashida]</i>

251
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,210
He comes here often, doesn't he?

252
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,590
The man who you've been suggesting a book for.

253
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,670
I bet he has a crush on you, Ms. Totsuka.

254
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,440
When he comes into the store, he immediately looks for you.

255
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,760
I really enjoyed the book you recommended.

256
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,580
Did you? Glad to hear it.

257
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,770
Is something wrong?

258
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,370
Not really. I'm in the middle of work.

259
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,740
Can we have a meal together?

260
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,050
Sorry for the sudden invitation.

261
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,180
Can you accompany me to a meal?

262
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm afraid I can't.

263
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,760
<i>Although I told Maho and Satoko</i>

264
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,230
that we must live a happy life,

265
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,420
but I felt like I didn't deserve it.

266
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,930
Were you afraid to hold a knife?

267
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,090
I can't forget the sensation

268
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,450
of stabbing a person.

269
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,530
Even if I were to date a man,

270
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,040
I won't be able to cook without holding a knife.

271
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,280
Having such a flaw, I wouldn't be able to be happy.

272
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,940
Are you happy now?

273
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,630
Are you working on your books here?

274
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,440
Yes.

275
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,740
Is this your favorite motto?

276
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,160
I guess you can say that.

277
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,510
<i>[Beautiful flowers bloom on trees with strong roots.]</i>

278
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,120
I knew you and I were fated to meet.

279
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,010
What?

280
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,510
Are you willing to novelize my story?

281
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,150
I haven't decided yet.

282
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,700
- Will I be able to receive any reward money?
- What?

283
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,310
The more, the better.

284
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,330
Lately, the publishing business is tanking.

285
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,010
The royalties I receive on one book

286
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,160
are a lot less than you think.

287
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,020
I won't be able to pay you a large sum of money.

288
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,180
I'm in need of money.

289
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,760
So will you write the book?

290
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,360
Is it to pay for the treatment?

291
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,490
I remember you said at the beginning,

292
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,040
one of your friends has pancreatic cancer.

293
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,630
Between Maho and Satoko,

294
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,270
which one has cancer?

295
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,120
Well...

296
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,220
I'll tell you that at the end.

297
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,930
If you need money for the treatment,

298
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,170
I suggest you talk to a writer more popular than me.

299
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,010
No, it has to be you to write the story.

300
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,450
Why does it have to be me?

301
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,380
Because I'm a fan of yours.

302
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,280
A huge fan of yours, Ms. Oikawa

<i>[The Knight in the Snow, Written by Reigo Hayashida]</i>

305
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,190
Hello?

306
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,780
Mom, what's up?

307
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,970
What?

308
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,350
Your mom must be wary of me.

309
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,460
I asked for your phone number, but she refused to tell me.

310
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,300
Sorry about that.

311
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,790
Shall we drink wine? It's my treat.

312
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,480
Satoko, you look pretty.

313
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,940
You think so? Maybe because I got married.

314
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,160
What? With whom?

315
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,470
A customer of mine who visited me at the bar I worked.

316
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,270
I used to work at a hostess bar.

317
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,510
He is much older than me, but...

318
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,370
he's loaded and treats me well.

319
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,880
He also dotes on our daughter.

320
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,230
You have a child?

321
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,320
Congratulations!

322
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,060
Are you happy now, Yuri?

323
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,740
I am.

324
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,510
I work at a book store. I'm having fun every day.

325
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,460
Good to hear.

326
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,630
I've been wondering how you were doing.

327
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,720
I've been wanting to thank you.

328
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,960
Back then, you told us,

329
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,220
"We must live a happy life."

330
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,780
Right.

331
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,690
If you strongly believe that,

332
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,050
then I thought I can be happy, too.

333
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,980
So I was hoping you were living a happy life.

334
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm sorry for being late.

335
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,690
It's fine.

336
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,390
Can we go to a restaurant? Is there any food you don't like?

337
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,990
There isn't.

338
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,730
Then, why don't we walk for a bit?

339
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,330
Thank you for the call.

340
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm terribly sorry for being late.

341
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,650
Don't be.

342
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,120
- Mr. Natsume.
- Ms. Totsuka.

343
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,720
Go ahead.

344
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,590
Mr. Natsume, what type of work do you do?

345
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,690
I'm a government employee.

346
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,950
Have you always loved reading books?

347
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,090
When I was younger, I only read mangas.

348
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,270
I started to enjoy reading novels only after my friend introduced them to me.

349
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,100
Wow. When was that?

350
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,170
When I was in high school.

351
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,590
Friends in high school are awesome.

352
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,740
Without any obligation,

353
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,890
just hanging out with friends I love.

354
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,800
That's right.

355
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,170
Did I say something wrong?

356
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,090
No, you didn't.

357
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,530
Including the friend I just mentioned,

358
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,690
I have two friends who are precious to me.

359
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,560
But I think I'll never see them again.

360
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,190
What?

361
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,230
I ended a friendship with one friend on bad terms.

362
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,760
I don't think she considers me as her friend anymore.

363
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,960
But she is your precious friend, right?

364
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,580
Right.

365
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,300
If she's precious to you, then she is still your friend.

366
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,320
Even if you can't see her, or what she thinks of you,

367
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:16,180
friends have a special place in your heart.

368
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,600
Mr. Natsume,

369
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,030
shall we eat dinner?

370
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,730
Sure.

371
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,330
Let's see. What are you in the mood for?

372
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,660
You seem excited. Are you going on a date?

373
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,830
Yes.

374
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Totsuka, you have a call.

375
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,220
Yuri.

376
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,750
It's been a while.

377
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,230
I didn't expect we both lived in Tokyo.

378
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,140
Your mom told me about it when I called.

379
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,120
Good evening. What is your name?

380
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,260
This is Yoriko. She'll turn three next month.

381
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,560
She is shy around people.

382
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,940
Satoko is married and has a daughter now.

383
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,100
Have you met her lately?

384
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,910
Yes. After she broke up with Ogata,

385
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,660
she married a nice rich man.

386
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,740
She looked happy.

387
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,960
It's completely opposite of me.

388
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
What?

389
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,590
My husband beats me up.

390
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,920
After we got married, he had some troubles at work. He started to vent his anger on me.

391
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,490
He watched my every move and doesn't give me any money.

392
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,210
Have you contacted a protection center?

393
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,630
I have once, but it was no use.

394
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,500
My husband is a smooth talker, so the officials believed him.

395
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,800
Even my mom thinks I'm at fault.

396
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,160
Can you kill my husband?

397
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,830
We haven't met for so long till now.

398
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,430
I even called your house from a payphone. So don't worry.

399
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,830
- Nobody is going to suspect you, Yuri.
- Wait a second.

400
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,220
I thought about this long and hard.

401
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,860
He is the father of my daughter, after all.

402
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,500
I agonized over coming here.

403
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,860
Since our last meeting wasn't exactly a happy event.

404
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,360
<i>If Satoko threatens me again,</i>

405
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,460
<i>kill Satoko for me, Yuri.</i>

406
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,670
Back then, I was jealous of Satoko.

407
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,260
I even killed a man for your sake,

408
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,200
but you didn't hesitate to tell Satoko the truth.

409
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,560
I saw how Satoko was important to you.

410
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,930
The other day, my husband tried to hit her for the first time.

411
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,640
When I stopped him, he kicked me in the stomach.

412
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,930
For me and as well as for my girl,

413
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,930
I want to start my life over.

414
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,570
<i>I thought she was taking advantage of me,</i>

415
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,930
because she killed Satoko's grandfather in my stead.

416
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,030
She asked me to kill her husband

417
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,610
to return the favor.

418
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,340
So you had decided to help her after all?

419
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,660
Maho, Satoko, and I...

420
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,850
we were entangled in a twisted fate.

421
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,210
So I thought...

422
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,250
we must help each other to survive.

423
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,180
<i>We're unable to answer the phone,</i>

424
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,840
<i>please leave your message after the beep.</i>

425
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,520
<i>This is Natsume. I'll call back later.</i>

426
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,990
<i>Your opponent is a grown man.</i>

427
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,630
<i>If you face him straight on, he might kill you.</i>

428
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,170
I'll put him to sleep.

429
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,350
I'll spike his "shochu" liquor with sleeping pills.

430
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,310
Aren't sleeping pills detectable in an autopsy?

431
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,810
You're giving away the reason to suspect you.

432
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,390
I'll be staying with my mom that day.

433
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:18,050
I'll make sure my neighbors see me, to provide a perfect alibi.

434
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,290
Why was Maho there?

435
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,980
According to the plan, she's supposed to be at her mom's for an alibi.

436
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,910
At the moment, I couldn't think straight.

437
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:22,550
I wanted to call, I didn't even know her phone number.

438
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,960
A few days had passed, but I still hadn't heard from her.

439
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,260
I was too terrified to watch the news.

440
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,570
So I had no idea what happened to her husband.

441
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,470
Did the police ever contact you?

442
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,960
No, never.

443
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,640
However, one day...

444
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,340
<i>Sorry for making you wait.</i>

445
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,310
<i>Maho, you're late.</i>

446
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,420
<i>I thought she was freed,</i>

447
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,770
<i>because her abusive husband had died.</i>

448
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,130
But that wasn't the case?

449
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,850
Yuri, don't you have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

450
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,870
I don't.

451
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,520
Your life might be fulfilled now,

452
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,240
but you're getting older sooner than you think.

453
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,270
The other day, I...

454
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,240
bumped into Maho's mom at the mall.

455
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,310
- You know, Maho hasn't married either.
- What?

456
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,230
You always find some similarities between friends.

457
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,510
- She's not married?
- That's what I said.

458
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:28,330
She is a career woman and lives alone in Tokyo.

459
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:32,590
She was always clever since young.

460
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,910
<i>If that wasn't her husband,</i>

461
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,300
<i>then...</i>

462
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,520
<i>who was the man I killed?</i>

463
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,720
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Influence Team @Viki.com</i>

464
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,550
<i>[Next Episode]
Did you two plot this from the begining?</i>

465
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,080
<i>Yuri, if you keep your mouth shut, everything will be all right.</i>

466
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,660
<i>It's not normal to kill someone.</i>

467
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,710
<i>It doesn't matter who does it, as long as it's not too risky.</i>

468
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,230
<i>You lied and tricked me, so you even took advantage of me.</i>

469
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,430
<i>Where were you that night?</i>
