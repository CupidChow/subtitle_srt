There are many writers who write about relationships between women.

What happened to the three of you after that?

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,080
Satoko sacrificed herself for me.

38
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,420
Neither Maho nor I knew why she did.

39

Why did they arrest Satoko?
<i>[December, 1984]</i>

40

She turned herself in saying she killed him.

Why...?

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,550
Satoko can see the park from her window.

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,390
- Then...
- She might have been watching...

44
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,550
when I killed that man.

45
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,860
Then, she is covering for you?

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,340
That's what I don't understand.

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,970
Satoko hates me, so she wouldn't cover for me.

48
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,040
But you two used to be friends, right?

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,180
Yeah, but not anymore.

50

Then... Satoko is telling the truth.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,590
Satoko was alarmed when she saw it from her room and came out to the park.

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,820
But it was after we ran off.

53
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,230
He was still alive and tried to attack Satoko then.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,790
So, Satoko stabbed him to death.

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,690

Since Maho enrolled in high school with a low academic performance,

180
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,460
I'm thinking of sending her to a cram school.

181
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,170
So she won't have much time to hang out with you.

182
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,170
Mom...

183
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,640
<i>What are you saying? Don't be rude.</i>

184
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,850
<i>I told you not to hang out with her.</i>

185
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,830
She grew up with Satoko Hino who murdered a man.

186
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,570
- It has nothing to do with Yuri.
- Of course, it does.

187
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,030
A person's life is determined by upbringing and the environment one was raised.

You should choose your friends wisely.

190
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,530
She is not on the same level as you.

191
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,170
Stop it already.

192
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,340
Right after that, I gave up being friends with her.

193
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,270
Gave up?

194
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,670
I knew how grown-ups can be unreasonable sometimes.

195
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,070
I remember, a long ago...

196
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,370
my parents refused to help Satoko

197
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,690
who was sexually abused.

198
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,440
Just like that, Maho's mother excluded me

199
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,920
from Maho's life.

200
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,690
I bet Maho didn't agree to that.

201
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,770
She doesn't seem to be the type to abandon her friend just because her mom said so.

202
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,520
You're right.

203
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,120
But I was the one who drove her away.

Gradually, the distance between us became greater.

205
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,820
Because of the incident,

206
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,880
our friendship turned completely sour.

- Okay.

I'm out unexpectedly fast, aren't I?

221
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,460
What?

222
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,850
Getting released from juvie.

223
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,400
It is? I don't know much about it.

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,820
The police discovered many items in his car.

225
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,020
Packing tape and handcuffs.

226
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,120
Those items speak of his ill intention itself.

227
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,040
So they reduced my sentence under the circumstance.

228
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,940
Satoko, did you confess to the police the truth?

229
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,830
I did.

230
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,570
But... that man...

231
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,350
I know you stabbed him with a knife.

232
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,540
When I was looking out my window that night,

233
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,070
I saw the man attacking Maho.

234
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,760
Let go of me.

235
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,140

Why...?

241
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,340
Why did you kill him?

242
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,570
I wanted to protect you, Yuri.

243
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,020
If I let him live, he would have exposed you.

244
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,620
I killed him to shut him up.

245
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,840
Did you believe that?

246
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,950
When I saw you stabbing the man,

247
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,840
I was envious of you because you might be getting arrested.

248
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,450

Can you help me this time?

258
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,500
Kill that old geezer for me.

259
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,700
If I were to kill him, the police would suspect me first. So you do it.

260

Don't you get it?

261
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,960
You were free because I took the blame for you.

262
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
Although it was self-defense,

263
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,350
you know how the public condemns a person who has been involved in a crime, don't you?

264

272
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,180
Right. But I bet you wouldn't know.

273
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,790
Since it's happened more than 30 years ago.

274
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,320

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm Naoko Okao. We were in the same grade.

277

We've never been in the same class or anything.

278
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,120
Seriously? I'm sorry, but I didn't know.

279
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,830
- You became a novelist, right?
- Yes.

280
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,720
Are you collecting materials for your book?

281
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,460
Well, sort of.

282
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,840
I remember Yuri, too.

283
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,150
I've been in the same class as her.

284
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,670
Remember the incident?

285
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,190
When Satoko Hino was attacked at a park near her house.

286
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,190
<i>- Bye, Teacher.</i>
- Be safe, girls.

287
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,930
<i>We will.</i>

288
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,830
The incident she ended up stabbing a man to death?

289
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,500
Do you know anything about the case?

290
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,920
For instance, she killed the man

291
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,520
in order to protect someone.

292
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,620
I didn't know there was such a rumor.

293
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,620
It's hypothetically speaking.

294
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,570
Hard to imagine Satoko would have sacrificed herself for someone.

295
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,980
We had no doubt that she killed him.

296
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,330
It's only natural based on her outrageous behaviors.

297
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,930
Do you know the whereabouts of Satoko and Maho?

298
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,860
I'm sorry. I don't.

299
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,750
They all lived in the same apartment complex, right?

300
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,160
An apartment complex?

301
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,560
Right. I remember Satoko moved out.

302
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,950
About half a year after, she was released from juvie.

303
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,910
When Satoko's grandfather passed away.

304
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,820
Her grandfather?

305
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,580
Let's wait another six months to kill the old geezer.

306
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,330
During the summer break?

307
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,500
Until then, we won't speak alone in public.

308
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,660
We can't let others suspect that we're partners in crime.

309
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,790
I agree.

310
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,430
Yuri, did you study?

311
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,700
Sort of.

312
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,870
Naoko, can you guess the questions of the exam?

313
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,250
I'm sure Teacher Sato would include this on the test.

314
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,150
Also... the grammar. What else did he say?

315
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,100
Don't worry.

316
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,560
We were never seen as friends, so nobody will suspect you, Yuri.

317
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,520
You have no motive to kill my grandpa.

318
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,450
I know, but we have to think of an untraceable method.

319
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,840
We should stage an accident.

320
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,740
Falling down the stairs, or getting hit by a car.

321
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,030
Falling down the stairs won't kill him.

322
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,710
Someone might see me when I push him to a car.

323
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,430
How about a robbery?

324
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,180
When he is alone, sneak into the house and stab him with a knife.

325
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,370
Isn't that your forte, Yuri?

326
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,280
It's a joke.

327
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,050
I'll push him out a window.

328
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,290
Your apartment is on the fifth floor.

329
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,220
I'm sure he can't survive when falling from that height.

330
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,770
Prepare a spare key for me.

331
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,240
I'll lock the door when I'm done.

332
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,630
The police will handle the case as an accident.

333
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,510
But if you visit the house out of the blue,

334
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,930
he might suspect something.

335
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,440
When you leave the house,

336
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,060
tell him I'm stopping by

337
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,570
and I'll be waiting for you at your house.

338
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,150
What's the matter? You seem so enthusiastic, suddenly.

339
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,850
You want him dead, do you not?

340
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,610
Or were you bluffing?

This room.

344
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,620
He sleeps in the room with me and my little brother.

345
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,160
It's crazy, right?

My brother and I sleep in a bunk bed, and my grandpa sleeps on the floor.

347
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,450
He crawls into my bed even now, pretending to be half asleep.

348
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,070
Why didn't you tell your mom about him?

349
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,610
My mom pays no attention to me.

350
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,420
She adores my little brother, though.

352
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,820
Thank you.

353
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,910
It's too early to thank me.

354
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,270
I believe in you.

355
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,970
I was stunned

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,320
when you stabbed the man.

357
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,920
I stabbed the old geezer to death repeatedly in my head.

358
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,460
But I could never have translated the thought into action.

359
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,620
You know...

360
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,650
we used to play together here.

361
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,650
Yuri, come here.

362
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,990
Yuri!

363
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,860
Don't.

364
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,580
That was close. Get wet.

365
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,040
Stop it. I'll push you, too.

366
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Don't do that.

367
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,320
<i>Let's go, Satoko.</i>

368
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,520
<i>Closer to the water.</i>

369
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,140
After he's dead, we shouldn't see each other.

370
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,300
Right. I agree.

371
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,170
The statute of limitations for murder is 15 years.

372
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,130
So, we can see each other again after 15 years.

373
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:35,380
Hey, did you watch the show "The Life of Nomads" on TV last night?

374
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,390
Nomads? From where?

375
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,530
I don't know. Somewhere in the Soviet Union.

376
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,620
In 15 years, let's go there together.

377
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,190
We become nomads. We walk around looking for weeds to feed the sheep.

378
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,510
Sure. Sounds good.

379
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,150
Ah...

380
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,970
He's out.

381
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,950
Don't.

382
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,490
You think you need him so no one can mess with you, right?

383
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,430
Forget it.

384
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,860
I'm going to protect you from now on.

385
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,570
That's not all.

386
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,150
He is the same as me.

387
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,270
He was lonely.

388
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:11,420
His parents got divorced when he was little, and he was raised by his mother,

389
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,680
but she was always away flirting with men.

390
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,630
She only came back home once in a while to give him money.

391
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,140
She didn't care about her child at all.

392
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,540
That's why...

393
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,790
we stayed together.

394
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,970
When did you come out?

395
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,960
Yesterday.

396
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,510
I was waiting for your call.

397
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:03,630
Well, I didn't want to bother you when you might be seeing someone else.

398
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,080
Why would I?

399
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,930
I was in juvie, too.

400
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,560
What?

401
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,610
Nothing is going to change between us.

402
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,210
<i>Maybe he was the victim of society.</i>

403
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,800
<i>That boy, Ogata.</i>

404
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,760
His parents abandoned him

405
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,210
and nobody helped him while he was rotting away.

406
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,970
It's just like nobody helped Satoko Hino

407
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,980
when she was molested by her grandfather.

408
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,240
You may be right.

409
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,000
At the time,

410
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,780
I couldn't think that far, though.

411
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,750
Anyway, Satoko and I

412
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,400
put together a plan for summer break.

413
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,560
What about Maho? What was she doing?

414
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,060
I wasn't talking to Maho at all by then.

415
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,640
I think the outfit would suit you, Maho.

416
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,910
- Really?
- You'll definitely look cute

417
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,470
This denim jacket will look good on you, Sayaka.

418
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,960
- Yeah, it's cute. Let's go shopping on Sunday.
- Sounds good.

419
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,540

- Yeah.

432
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,570
Satoko went to the dentist.

433
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,920
Ah, she told me to wait in her room.

434
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,270
In her room?

435
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,790
Yes. Can I come in?

436
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,970
I remember she told me about it.

437
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,710
Geez, how dare she ask an old man to answer the door for her.

No.

Why do you ask?

This is the first time Satoko has invited her friend.

00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,200
You look like a decent girl. What do you want from her?

It's messy, right?

448
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,980
Satoko is really sloppy.

449
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,260

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,810
It's supposed to rain in the evening.

453
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,170
Rain?

454
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,390

- I'll do it right the next time.

He doesn't suspect a thing, so I'm sure I can do it.

Failing to do it the first time

469
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,620
erased my fear, actually.

470
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,980
I could use the same method only once more.

471
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:30,040
So, I was preparing myself

472
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,710
and waiting for the next opportunity.

473
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,980
It was then that Maho called me to her place.

474
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,020
Where is your mom today?

475
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,850
She has a meeting in Tokyo.

476
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,520
She's not coming back anytime soon, so don't worry.

477
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,830
Welcome.

478
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,180
Why?

479
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,430
Yuri, is it true that you are going to kill her grandfather?

480
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,500
I told her because you were getting cold feet.

481
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,790
I asked her to testify to the police if you ran away.

482
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,770
Testify?

483
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,080
That you are the one who stabbed that man first.

484
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,930
I haven't agreed to it.

485
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,980
That's why I called you here.

486
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,450
She took the blame for you on her own, to begin with.

487
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,550
You don't need to feel responsible for it.

488
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,160
Don't make me laugh.

489
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,660
You are the reason all that happened because you were attacked.

490
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,610
You took the blame so you could use Yuri later, didn't you?

491
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,860
That's enough.

492
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,240
I'm not going to run away.

493
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,480
So, you don't need to ask Maho to do that.

494
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,500
Yuri.

495
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,620
So, leave now.

496
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,610
Just pray that Yuri is not going to run away.

497
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,330
It is the fact that she stabbed that man.

498
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,670
I will make you testify.

499
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,060
I'll make sure you won't get involved in this.

500
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,160
I'm going to kill him.

501
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,740
What are you saying? I'm not testifying.

502
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,330
Even if you run away, I will never tell them that you stabbed him.

503
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,520
So, don't listen to her.

504
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,720
Or else, I'm going to tell Satoko's parents about your plan.

505
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,560
Did Satoko tell you

506
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,760

507
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,930
No.

What he attempted to do to you,

511
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,110
her grandfather was doing to her exactly that.

512
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,510

513
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,840

your mother is too occupied with her personal matters,

521
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,050

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,220
What do you mean?

537
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,570
Whether you're the perpetrator and I fake your alibi,

538
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,410
or the other way around.

539
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,270
Nobody needs to know, as long as we accomplish our goal.

540
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:27,410
I knew I was the most suited perpetrator for the murder.

541
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,610
I can protect you, Yuri.

542
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,200
In order to protect a friend, a murder was committed.

543
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,740
That's the hidden story of your friendship

544
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,840
that you wanted to tell me.

545
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,350
Right.

546
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,200
But the story is far from being over.

547
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,420
The three of us...

548
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,210
have killed...

549
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,180
one more person.

Let's forget the whole thing and find our own happiness.</i>

552
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,240
<i>Being with her, wouldn't do her any good.</i>

553
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,430
<i>Can you kill for me?</i>

554
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,510
<i>The police might find your fingerprints.</i>

555
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,230
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

556
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,450
<i>I'm a huge fan of yours, Ms. Oikawa.</i>

557
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,540
<i>Satoko isn't our enemy.</i>

558
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,380
<i>You mean, killing Satoko?</i>
