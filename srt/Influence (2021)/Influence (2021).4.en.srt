How did you find out my number?

128
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,710
The apartment building will be demolished for new condos.

129
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,620
So I had the Legal Affairs Bureau look into the registration of the building.

130
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,960

So I was able to find your number.

133
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,620
You had me kill that man, is it because he was a hindrance to your new condos?

134
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,440
That's right.

135
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,970
When my father passed away in Tokyo last year,

136
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,960
I inherited the apartment building.

137
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,480
<i>There were many vacancies in the run-down apartment.</i>

138
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,210
<i>Just to maintain it, I've been losing money.</i>

139
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,650
<i>I was in a bigger hole because he refused to move out.</i>

140
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,260
<i>But if I'd have killed him, the police would have caught up with me in no time.</i>

141
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,140
<i>Since I have the clear motive.</i>

142
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,960
Is that why you had me kill that man?

143
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,810
How could you...?

144
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,040
I helped you because I thought you were suffering.

145
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,570
You said your husband was beating you.  You tricked me.

146
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,530
Killing abusive men doesn't hurt your conscience as much.

147
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,350
The reason isn't important.

148
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,350
<i>It doesn't matter who does it, as long as we don't get caught.</i>

149

<i>You have no relation with that man whatsoever.</i>

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,720
We haven't seen each other for ages, so don't worry.

151
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,090
Nobody will suspect you for sure.

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,420
Only if you keep your mouth shut, everything goes well.

153
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,730
So what did you do?

154
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,380
You did nothing as Maho suggested?

155
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,820
I didn't expect you to be so impatient.

156
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,120
What did I do after that...

157
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,140
It's more exciting not knowing the ending till the very end.

158
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,790
Then, why don't we talk about your current situation?

159
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,970
What do you do for a living, Ms. Totsuka?

160
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,460
I can't answer that, Ms. Oikawa.

161
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,340
You can easily guess the ending based on my answer.

162
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,570
If I had been arrested for that murder,

163
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,660
I would be struggling with my life because I would be an ex-convict.

164
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,310
If I haven't been caught and the statute of limitations is over,

165
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,300
I could be living as a good citizen like the rest,

166
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,490
even though I'm a murderer.

167
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,190

Let me get you fresh coffee.

Are you afraid of me?

170
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,040
A person in a right mind wouldn't ask you to write a book

171
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,360
about one's own murder.

172
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,810
I must be a little different from others.

173
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,430
What do you mean by that?

174
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,750
Because...

175
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,940
rather than feeling guilty for killing the man,

176
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,820
I was more devastated when I found out

177
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,800
Maho deceived me.

178
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,930
I must be crazy, don't you think?

179
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,460
I suppose.

180
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,220
Are these your new books?

181
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,390
What?

182
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,630
May I take a look?

183
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,060
Sure.

188
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,980
Can I buy this book?

189
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,820
I'll pay for it.

190
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,070
Of course.

191
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,640
I don't have any extras now, so I'll prepare one for you till our next meeting.

192
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
Thank you.

193
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,420
Can you write down my name?

194
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,690
If possible, along with your favorite motto.

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,130
Is her life story so captivating?

198
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,650
For me, indeed, it is.

199
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,420
Hey, take a look at this.

200
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,740

You were cute.

204
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,380
Sorry.

What?

207
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,130
We went to the same high school.

208
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,700
So as Maho Sakazaki and Satoko Hino who appear in her story.

209
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,290
Does she know that?

210
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm not sure.

211
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,100
I don't know if it's a mere coincidence, or she has an ulterior motive.

212
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,470
Ms. Oikawa, you should be more careful.

213
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,270
There are crazy people out there.

214
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,800
Don't meet up with her at your house.

215
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,640
Mr. Muragishi, I have a favor to ask.

216
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,270

<i>Are you inquiring about a person named Yuri Totsuka?</i>

219
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,060
That's correct.

We don't have an employee by that name.

221
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,100
I believe she worked there 25 years ago.

222
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,110
Do you know anybody who worked there around that time?

223
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,580
I see. I'll call you back if I find out anything.

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,560

I had it in my bag, but I forgot to give it to you last time.

Not at all. I know you were doing your job.

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,550
My husband is watching her.

250
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,210
That's so sweet of him.

251
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,920
I guess.

252
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,520
What?

253
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,250
I thought I would never see you again.

254
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,020
You said before, "This is the last time we meet."

255
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,880
You didn't even tell me your number.

256
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,180
That was my intention.

257
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,870
My daughter is three now.

258
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:09,930
Come to think of it, we played together when we were three.

259
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,410
Believe it or not, I've watched over you,

260
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,760
even when we stopped hanging out together...

261
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,820
when we were in elementary, middle, and high school...

262

<i>Do you think we're stupid?</i>

263
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,730
<i>What? Seriously?</i>

264
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,120
<i>- Stop teasing me.
- We can't help it.</i>

265
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,890
I guess I've always thought of you as a friend.

266
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,440
Why are you telling me that now?

267
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:15,160
I want to say a proper farewell in person at our last meeting.

268
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,920
You and I have lived in two different worlds from the start.

269
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,090
Since I'm married to a rich man, I can afford to buy fancy clothes.

270
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,860
But my tainted past can't be erased.

271
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,770
You're not tainted. That's me who is tainted.

272
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,470
You're innocent, Yuri.

273
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,440
You're wrong. Because I...

274
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,040
I think...

275
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,910
we shouldn't meet each other from now on.

276
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,130
To tell you the truth, I'm tormented whenever I see you,

277
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,450
because you remind me of that old geezer.

278
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,020
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, my daughter is waiting for me.

279
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,240
Can you give me your phone number?

280
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,980
I won't call if you don't want me to.

281
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,980
But I want to have it just in case.

282
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,000
I want to feel that we're connected somewhat.

283
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,550
Can I write it on this paper?

284
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,700
Yuri, you should get married.

285
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,350
Don't you have a boyfriend?

286
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm off now.

287
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,860
You don't have to send me off.

288
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,370
<i>Maho deceived me, and now Satoko is out of my life, too.</i>

289
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,510
I thought I was all alone without any friends.

290
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,370
What happened with Mr. Natsume?

291
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,470
You fell in love with him, did you not?

292
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,410
Maybe I had.

293
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:46,120
But I asked him out to a meal for a very different reason.

294
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,240
I only wanted to know the status of the police investigation.

295
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:58,230
How much the police suspected Maho...

296
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,590
<i>On that night,</i>

297
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,380
<i>I'd learned something that I shouldn't.  </i>

298
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,210
<i>Oh? It's you, Mr. Natsume. Hello there.</i>

299
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,660
<i>It's been a while.</i>

300
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,940
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

301
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,460
<i>I'm going to grab a drink with someone.</i>

302
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,060
<i>Oh, I see. You should stop by here sometime later.</i>

303
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,160
<i>- Talk to you later then.
- Okay.</i>

304
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,690
<i>Gentlemen, why don't you come in?</i>

305
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,890
<i>Let's have some fun.</i>

306
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,830
Is the man from earlier an acquaintance of yours?

307
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,820
What?

308
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,060
The tout in a black suit.

309
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,900
Oh, him? Why do you ask?

310
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,080
He resembles an acquaintance of mine named Ogata.

311
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,560
That's him. His name is Ogata.

312
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,960
He has cooperated in my investigation before.

313
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,680
Cooperated?

314
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,730
He left the yakuza syndicate and works diligently now.

315
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,730
How do you know Ogata?

316
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,730
He was an upperclassman in my high school. He's a year older than me.

317
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,160
Is something wrong?

318
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,860
What a small world.

319
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,950
I mean, Maho Sakazaki and you attended the same high school.

320
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,940
Speaking of Maho...

321
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,960
The man who was murdered lived in the apartment that Maho owns.

322
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,780
They had gotten into an argument because he refused to move out.

323
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,620
Please tell me more. I'm worried about Maho.

324
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,470
Does the police suspect Maho of killing the man?

325
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,320
Maho Sakazaki has an alibi.

326
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,840
Moreover, the victim was involved in fraud a few months ago,

327
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,610
and he was a member of an organized crime group.

328
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,280
Fraud?

329
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,350
He and other members disputed about the allocation of money. That's why he was killed.

330
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,150
At least, that's how we surmise the case.

331
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,390
Then, Maho is no longer a suspect?

332
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:03,700
But I, for one, still suspect her.

333
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,870
If she's able to flip that old apartment into condos,

334
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,900
she can earn a lot of profit.

335
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,340
But if the apartment building stays the way it is,

336
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,750
she won't be able to collect rent money and it'll cause a loss.

337
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,700
Didn't you say she has an alibi?

338
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,040
So I believe she has an accomplice in the crime.

339
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,470
Sorry. I talked too much.

340
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,670
I get overly worked up when I talk about the case.

341
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,940
My father used to run a bar in my hometown.

342
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,980
Everything was so cheap in his bar.

343
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,020
He said he wants to serve delicious liquor to hard-working people

344
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,850
who don't have much money.

345
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,440
Sometimes, he lets them drink for free.

346
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,590
Despite all that, he was killed by one of his customers.

347
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,430
That's why I can’t forgive murderers

348
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:29,170
who take someone else's life for whatever reason it is

349
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,820
I can understand that.

350
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,210
Your apartment is around here, is it not?

351
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,580
Can I ask you out again?

352
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,740
See you.

353
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,820
Have a good night.

354
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,200
I should tell you about the victim.

355
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,720
The victim, who was possibly murdered by Maho Sakazaki,

356
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,740
had a wife and a child.

357
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,870
This is his wife.

358
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,180
Satoko Yamashita.

359
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,140
Her maiden name was Satoko Hino.

360
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,420
She also attended your high school.

361
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,440
When she worked at a hostess bar in her hometown,

362
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,070
she met the victim who was her customer and married him.

363
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,600
<i>He is much older than me, but he's loaded and treats me well.</i>

364
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,860
However, her husband...

365
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,630
started a business in Tokyo and failed.

366
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,370
Gradually, he started to drown his sorrow in alcohol.

367
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,720
He even beat up his wife, Satoko.

368
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,520
<i>My husband beats me up.</i>

369
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,580
<i>His business failed after we got married.</i>

370
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,590
<i>He started to vent his anger on me.</i>

371
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,800
<i>We shouldn't meet up from now on.</i>

372
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,130
<i>The number you have dialed is no longer in service.</i>

373
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,910
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

374
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,140
What were you thinking about coming here like this?

375
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,970
Satoko was the victim of domestic violence, not you.

376
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,410
The man I killed was Satoko's husband.

377
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,970
The reason for the murder wasn't because he refused to move out of the apartment.

378
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,970
It was because he was an abusive husband who beat Satoko.

379
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,380
Do you care for a drink?

380
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,240
Maho, did Satoko threaten you?

381
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,520
When you killed Satoko's grandfather for me,

382
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,080
you dropped something in the room, didn't you?

383
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,350
<i>I found this in the room on that day.</i>

384
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,720
<i>If I give it to the police, they might find your fingerprints.</i>

385
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,680
Did she threaten you by taking advantage of your weakness?

386
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,670
She demanded you to kill her husband, if you don't want your secret will be exposed.

387
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,200
But if you kill him, you'll be suspected since you have a motive.

388
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,300
That's why you had me kill him.

389
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,360
Did the two of you plot this from the beginning?

390
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,740
That's why Satoko came to say goodbye.

391
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,590
If our plan succeeds, we won't see each other again.

392
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,600
That was our rule.

393
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,840
That's why you gave me the fake contact info.

394
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,100
Answer me, Maho.

395
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,420
So what if it was?

396
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,620
You should have been honest with me.

397
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,850
Because Satoko threatened me, should I have begged you

398
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,730
for your help, Yuri?

399
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,150
Let's just forget it.

400
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,480
<i>During high school, Satoko killed a man for you, Yuri.</i>

401
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,080
Then, I killed...

402
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,900
<i>Satoko's grandfather for you.</i>

403
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,050
Now, you killed Satoko's husband for me.

404
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,220
Now, we don't owe anything to each other.

405
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,360
It's fair, don't you think?

406
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,040
You're totally wrong.

407
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,810
When we were in high school, we helped each other because we were friends.

408
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,740
But you two used me this time.

409
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,710
You lied to me and manipulated me.

410
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,650
Give me Satoko's phone number.

411
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,780
What are you going to tell her?

412
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,130
If she finds out about this, she might take advantage of you.

413
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,120
Then, we'll be stuck in the endless loop.

414
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,580
Right now, you should just focus on not getting caught.

415
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,510
We can put an end to this.

416
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,300
After this,

417
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,850
we will never see each other again.

418
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,110
<i>I thought I should just let it go.</i>

419
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,960
Just as Maho said that if I don't get caught,

420
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,620
the police would never find out the truth.

421
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,230
I should forget the whole thing

422
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,200
and fall in love with Mr. Natsume.

423
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,090
So that I can find my own happiness, just like everyone.

424
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Good evening.

425
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,100
Why are you here?

426
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,020
I was drinking and I started to miss you suddenly.

427
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,500
It's rare for you to get drunk.

428
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,630
I'll get you water.

429
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,180
I'm sorry.

430
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,220
I don't mind.

431
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,380
I mean...

432
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,800
To be honest, I don't like reading books all that much.

433
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,850
What?

434
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,440
I borrowed that book from you because I needed it for my investigation.

435
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,250
I had no choice but to read it because a copycat of the mystery novel committed a crime.

436
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,660
After that,

437
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,370
I stopped by just to see you.

438
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,940
Where were you that night?

439
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,870
The night of the murder,

440
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,150
I tried calling you several times.

441
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:46,350
But you never picked up.

442
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,030
I remember you said before that

443
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,170
you have two friends who are precious to you.

444
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,020
Who are your friends?

445
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,050
Why do you want to know?

446
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,040
May I have water?

<i>Everything became clear to me when I saw Satoko with Ogata.</i>

Satoko wanted to kill her husband, so she could be with Ogata.

469
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:50,750
That's why she threatened Maho and demanded to kill him.
