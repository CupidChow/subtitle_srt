00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,540
Thank You.

7
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,903
Louder, come on!

8
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,349
Slam a little more, come on, slam!

9
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,930
Great.

10
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,796
How could he do it?

11
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,388
I admit he's great.

12
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:39,681
- Come on one more time.
- Again he said? Wow!

13
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:42,354
- Good!
- Gather your strength again.

14
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:45,697
No, from within,
put it in!

15
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,149
Try to do it
by putting it in.

16
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,809
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Isn't he a cow?

17
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,891
Wow, really strong like a cow.

18
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,948
Its power is beyond doubt.

19
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,557
Geez.

20
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,284
THE QUEEN WHO CROWNS BEFORE SUNRISE

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,162
- Her waist!
- Come on, let's put your strength into it!

22
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:22,567
- Pull the waist!
- Her waist!

23
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:30,277
Yes, that's right!

24
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:34,144
What are you doing?

25
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,025
Ouch...

26
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,277
When tripping an opponent's leg, hook it
to the back of the ankle...

27
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,922
...not by kicking his shins
loudly like that.

28
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,860
Forgive me.

29
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:50,528
Geez.

30
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,175
- My ability...
- Come on...

31
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,795
- ...we go drinking together.
- Good.

32
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,206
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

33
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,757
Why do you fight?
without knowing the reason for your defeat?

34
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,221
Nobody got hurt?

35
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:15,932
Are you alright?

36
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,781
Well, it's only hurt to this extent,
I am alright.

37
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,654
If you feel offended...

38
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,064
...I apologize.

39
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:29,234
Wait.

40
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,321
I'd like to ask
just to make sure.

41
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:34,408
Do you know my name?

42
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,569
Aren't you Lee Bang Won?

43
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:41,469
That's right, Lee Bang Won...

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,862
Wait, where are you going?

45
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:45,050
Hey.

46
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,172
The teacher has arrived.

47
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,775
Come on everyone, come in.

48
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:05,471
King Xian said "Tang expelled Bang Ge,
and King Wu decided to punish."

49
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,292
Then Yu Zhi and Mencius said,

50
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:10,169
Why do you fight?
without knowing the reason for your defeat?

51
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,172
"A wise leader...

52
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,834
...JINSASI
During the previous Jinsasi exam,

53
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,217
the person who beat you
and he got the first rank, right?

54
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:20,694
...must lead in truth and morality.

55
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,088
If only you wrote
correctly the poem...

56
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,989
...surely you are the one who gets it
rank one.

57
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,402
People who do bad things
will get a reply.

58
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:29,094
Hey.

59
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,170
Why are you so unfocused?

60
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,032
What are you doing?

61
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,069
Continue.

62
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,540
"A bad person
will have bad consequences."

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,486
"People who do evil
will get punished."

64
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,302
"People who do bad things
will be rewarded accordingly."

65
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:50,176
"This is a clear teaching.
from the moral ruler."

66
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,593
Okay.
Good.

67
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:57,600
Weren't you too loud earlier?
towards the student?

68
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:58,957
Who?

69
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,876
- The one I hit with the fan?
- Not him.

70
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,797
"Why do you fight?
without knowing the reason for your defeat?â€

71
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:07,332
Oh.

72
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:10,174
His facial expression suddenly changed.

73
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,936
It seemed like his pride was badly hurt.

74
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,341
Every time I see it,
what is it like...

75
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,776
He's too tense.

76
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,211
Rigid.

77
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,882
Like a scholar who would be in danger
if you don't pass the exam quickly.

78
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,051
I heard his father
is General Lee Seong Gye?

79
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,495
He said,

80
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,575
His wish is for it to exist
who passed the literature exam in the family.

81
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,357
Is it true?

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
By the way that person...

83
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:37,184
...if it goes like this.

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,260
Like this, it looks sad.

85
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,668
Sad?

86
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,462
Yeah. It looks like that.

87
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:46,714
Oh, I see?

88
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,672
I who serve as Daesaseong,

89
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,534
DAESASEONG
CHIEF OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

90
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,677
have gathered you in my house...

91
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,311
...is because...

92
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:56,681
...the implementation of the Yebusi exam
which is less than a year away.

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,025
Don't be influenced by the Dano festival...

94
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,234
...focus on reading books
and try hard.

95
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,102
- Good.
- Good.

96
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,332
Set out to make a name,

97
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:06,763
attain glory and honor...

98
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:08,326
...so that...

99
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,191
...become a way to lift
family honor.

100
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,475
Oh, it's finally here.

101
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,999
Isn't that Wang Ik?
The King's cousin.

102
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:28,696
Recently he received a letter
from the Emperor in the Northern Yuan Dynasty.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,320
Come on, sit down everyone. Yes.
Come on, everyone.

104
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,236
Learn about the political situation,

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,960
neighboring countries
that surrounds Goryeo...

106
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,687
...very important ahead
Yebusi exam next year.

107
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:44,028
Therefore,

108
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,680
I called him on purpose today.

109
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:49,574
I am Yeongyeongun, Wang Ik.

110
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:52,774
I came here because I couldn't
reject request...

111
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:53,805
...my future in-laws.

112
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,855
Thank you for the Surichwi cake.

113
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,272
Your mother will like it.

114
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:11,122
He even made
flower socks for me.

115
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:14,292
Oh...

116
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,957
- Mother?
- I beg you.

117
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:17,639
Go.

118
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:20,163
She is the only daughter I have.

119
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,976
Those are the officers from
Royal Matchmaking Agency.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,921
KINGDOM MATCHBUREAU
Tribute Girl?

121
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,012
TRIBUTE GIRL, YOUNG WOMAN
DEDICATED TO

122
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:28,382
NORTHERN YUAN DYNASTY AND MING DYNASTY
Good grief.

123
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,541
He's running away, catch him!

124
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,965
Don't!

125
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:33,518
- Don't!
- Go after him!

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,779
Catch up!

127
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,440
Come on, wake up. Come on.

128
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,755
Don't! Let him go!

129
00:07:58,263 --> 00:07:59,365
Northern Yuan Dynasty and Ming Dynasty,

130
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,156
jockeying for power
in the Zhongyuan area.

131
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:04,416
However, the Northern Yuan Dynasty
request military support from Goryeo.

132
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,310
What do you think?

133
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,697
We must not send troops.

134
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:09,651
Why?

135
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:10,657
The Ming Dynasty was
the rising sun,

136
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,883
while the Northern Yuan Dynasty
is the setting sun.

137
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,886
What's more, people are suffering
due to the Japanese pirate invasion.

138
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,378
Which must be protected by
our army today is...

139
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,956
...our own people.

140
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:20,858
In that case...

141
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,349
...what would you say
in the Northern Yuan Dynasty?

142
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,352
The weather is too hot.

143
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,186
The weather is too cold.

144
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,704
In hot weather, grass
what the horse ate withered.

145
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,680
In cold weather, the grass
eaten by the horse it froze.

146
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:35,704
Geez.

147
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:38,409
Will they believe?

148
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,270
That's why we need
diplomatic skills, right?

149
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,103
From the royal family,

150
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,315
like Yeongyeongun.

151
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,108
Father...

152
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,172
...provide special teaching
to those of us who are chosen for this Jinsasi exam...

153
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,528
...it turns out there's a reason for all of that, huh.

154
00:08:57,926 --> 00:08:59,400
Without a solid foundation,

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,553
even though it managed to get through
difficult test...

156
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,782
...a person will never
to be a good official.

157
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:04,802
Older brother!

158
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,887
This is serious, there's a problem!

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,780
Brother Won Gyeong in
Royal Matchmaking Agency...

160
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:12,862
Royal Matchmaking Agency? What do you mean?

161
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,612
Wait, that Royal Matchmaking Bureau,

162
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,281
- isn't it the tribute girl selection office?
- Therefore!

163
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,662
Why is he there...

164
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,486
Do not tell...

165
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,187
...let's go there quickly.

166
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,393
I'm coming too.

167
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,003
- Good grief.
- Wait!

168
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,789
I can't run anymore.

169
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:29,394
Wait for me.

170
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,473
Even if you only choose a tribute girl...

171
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,331
...there are still times and procedures.

172
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,667
How to do it
carelessly like this?

173
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,235
Here it is,

174
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,052
you just get out of here.

175
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,365
What is the problem?

176
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,285
I said so
because my friend was arrested.

177
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,876
I have to meet
with the head of this office.

178
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:46,785
Do I need to explain further?

179
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,285
This time, the messenger came
from the Northern Yuan Dynasty.

180
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,108
The Northern Yuan Dynasty is currently
war with the Ming Dynasty,

181
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,470
and because of that, they need women
to marry a soldier...

182
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,494
Hey...

183
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:56,587
You want to,

184
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,790
if your sister is married off
with soldiers at war?

185
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:00,558
That's not even war
involving Goryeo.

186
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,896
Gosh, you're pissing me off.

187
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,489
But you're not the one getting married!

188
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:07,765
Who's he?

189
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,894
Daughter of Daesaseong Min Je,
Sungkyunkwan's great official.

190
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,961
Oh, no wonder.

191
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,138
Bro.

192
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,552
Please take him away,
this frustrates me.

193
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:20,768
He has destroyed
four officers of the Royal Matchmaking Bureau.

194
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,756
Please take responsibility and treat them.

195
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,568
Okay, I understand.

196
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,185
Bro.

197
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:28,820
Let's go.

198
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:31,885
I won't go.

199
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:33,611
I can't go!

200
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,080
Do we do it because we like it?

201
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,275
We were forced to do this
because it was ordered from above!

202
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,731
That's right.

203
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:43,768
Nothing can be done
by these people.

204
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,540
What will change?
if we push those people?

205
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,019
I want to meet the person responsible
in charge of the Royal Matchmaking Bureau.

206
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,378
If you have met?

207
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,684
This is a government decision.

208
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:58,286
What will change?

209
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,416
So,

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,319
are we just going to
just let it be and keep quiet?

211
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:05,177
You must know very well
how is the state of the world.

212
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,494
But this way...

213
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:09,385
...looks like a complaint
from the daughter of a powerful family.

214
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,957
- What did you say?
- Goryeo has no power...

215
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,154
...and the people of Goryeo are even weaker.

216
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,116
So, this is the result
from that situation...

217
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:20,076
...it's not just the fault of a few people.

218
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,039
So?

219
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:27,167
I mean, it wasn't you who was taken
as a tribute girl, right?

220
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,695
- Is not it?
- Of course.

221
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,748
What a stroke of luck.

222
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:34,116
Don't care about others,
you absolutely cannot go.

223
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,291
It's true, you shouldn't have gone.

224
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:37,584
That's what I mean.

225
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:38,689
Geez.

226
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:40,939
You're all bastards!

227
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:44,567
You only think about how
to rise in rank and live in luxury.

228
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,077
No wonder Goryeo is like this.

229
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:47,991
What a shameless person.

230
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,001
No, wait...

231
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:56,574
He looked very angry.

232
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,076
Bro!

233
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,993
<i>Why do you fight?</i>
<i>without knowing the reason for your defeat?</i>

234
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:10,855
Oh...

235
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,519
Hit it with a fan.

236
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,296
I have never seen
such a brave woman.

237
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:22,879
So satisfying...

238
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,321
...also feels fresh.

239
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,977
Not only that.

240
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,296
In order to prevent his friend
brought as a tribute girl,

241
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,831
a woman even facing
four officials of the Royal Matchmaking Bureau.

242
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,932
Ouch.

243
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,830
Do not move.

244
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,863
Ouch.

245
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,787
Young Sil.

246
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,091
Are you hooked?

247
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:47,825
All the time, you
talk only about that woman.

248
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:51,209
Ouch.

249
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,800
Slowly.

250
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,298
Okay.

251
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,882
There is one thing I must explain.

252
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:19,657
What?

253
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:22,693
I...

254
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:24,813
...not a fucking bastard.

255
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,597
I mean,

256
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:31,571
I have no intention of getting promoted
just to live a luxurious life.

257
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,479
If so, that's good.

258
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,475
I heard you have a fiancÃ©?

259
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:40,811
Yes

260
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,663
I wonder how you feel.

261
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:48,408
Why do you want to know about that?

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,780
I feel my heart constantly
leading to you.

263
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,379
I try hard to...

264
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,582
...building embankments
to be able to hold back that feeling.

265
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,511
But if the embankment collapses...

266
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,872
...I'm afraid I can't
control myself.

267
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,735
So...

268
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,271
...if this is the feeling
that I have to get rid of,

269
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,473
I have to get rid of everything
before it's too late. So.

270
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:11,670
Please remove it.

271
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,811
Forgive me.

272
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:30,478
I beg you, please.

273
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,464
I ask.

274
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,476
Why don't you take the child?

275
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,614
Why did you only bring
my daughter becomes a tribute girl?

276
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:44,341
Wait a moment.

277
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,743
Now I'm really going to leave.

278
00:14:57,654 --> 00:14:59,087
I'm the one who's going.

279
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,495
What's wrong with you?

280
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,030
I just feel guilty.

281
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,313
What for?

282
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,519
For all.

283
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,476
I didn't go to die.

284
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,343
It's okay. Take it easy.

285
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,999
Nothing will happen.

286
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,592
When women in a family
become a tribute girl...

287
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,982
...parents and relatives must be sad.

288
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,193
Day and night her crying did not stop.

289
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,478
Crying out loud on the day
when chosen as a tribute girl...

290
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,047
...sad and upset...

291
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,971
...some even committed suicide.

292
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,293
Because I'm a girl...

293
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,980
...there is no way to report this.

294
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:08,514
But you are Sungkyunkwan students.

295
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,962
Please fill out this petition...

296
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,674
...then give it to <i>Munhabu Nangsa</i> .

297
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,690
THE MUNHABU OF THE NANGSA
SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE BODY OF GORYEO

298
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,165
DUTY TO CARRY OUT INSPECTION

299
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,422
I'm not joining.

300
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,446
Me too.

301
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:25,991
Excuse me.

302
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,680
How about you?

303
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:35,686
Me too.

304
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,487
This doesn't seem right.

305
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,739
So naive.

306
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:45,631
This may sound cold,
but listen carefully.

307
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,274
Those gathered here...

308
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,806
...is a person with a purpose
to be successful and famous.

309
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,070
Why do they...

310
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:56,320
...doing something risky
before facing the Jebusi test?

311
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,018
Everyone is a coward.

312
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,867
Sometimes, people need courage...

313
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,888
...to be a coward.

314
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,443
My friend and I laughed together,

315
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,534
cry together
and share everything together.

316
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:12,181
My close friend was taken away
unfair as a tribute girl.

317
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,903
People just say,
"It wasn't you who left."

318
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:16,000
"Thank goodness it wasn't you."

319
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:21,116
Don't feel guilty.

320
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:27,370
Your friend was taken alone
it's not your fault.

321
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,316
I'm glad it wasn't you.

322
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,366
I'm serious.

323
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,622
How can you talk like that?

324
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,669
Go ahead if you think I'm selfish.

325
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,415
Because that's how I feel.

326
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,469
It's not that I don't have any
something else to say.

327
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:46,557
It feels rude in front of
people who have lost friends.

328
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,425
I'll stop here.

329
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,594
Geez.

331

Wait, <i>Daesaseong</i> .

332
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:09,027
Is Lee Bang Won a student of Sungkyunkwan?

333
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:10,696
Yes, right.

334
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,159
He is still a student
but how dare...

335
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:15,630
...put this in the office.

336
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:16,654

It's about the tribute girl.

339
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,788
Luckily I knew beforehand,

340
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,687
otherwise, there will definitely be a problem.

341
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:34,078
Are you laughing?

342
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:37,876
Get that student out of Sungkyunkwan.

343
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:39,353
What?

344
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,529
Although it's not been like that lately,

345
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,074
but the complaint is disturbing
keep popping up makes me dizzy.

346
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,702
I will use him as an example.

347
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,790
Are you trying to silence them?

348
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,455
Can't.

349
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:52,656
In that case...

350
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,168
...I will judge him.

351
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,827
Please go ahead.

352
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,386
Unlucky.

353
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:26,125
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

354
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:27,965
Let's go.

355
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,015
Older brother.

356
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,435
What are you doing here?

357
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:39,699
What is it?

358
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:40,838
There is a problem.

359
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:49,132
Are you really leaving?

360
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:52,063
If I don't go...

361
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,506
...won't I be judged?

362
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,842
Your father will be very disappointed.

363
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,360
Older brother.

364
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,594
Still here apparently.

365
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:14,493
You guys go out for a moment.

366
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,512
I want to talk.

367
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:18,609
Good.

368
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:21,011
See you again.

369
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:30,721
What are you doing?

370
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,741
PETITION

371
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,601
I wrote it myself.

372
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,031
This will not harm you.

373
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,935
Why are you doing it alone?

374
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,121
Young master.

375
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,014
At first I was curious about women
who cannot see injustice.

376
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:57,556
Then want to protect that naivety
who is willing to do anything for his friends.

377
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:01,882
However...

378
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:07,029
...I will find a way
so that you don't suffer alone.

379
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,967
I will find a way out.

380
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,519
There won't be any.

381
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,917
A student studying
to create a new world...

382
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,860
...but told to close my eyes
will be the injustice of the tribute girl.

383
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,903
You made me realize that.

384
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,001
So it's not something
who needs to be held accountable...

385
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:33,117
...or feared.

386
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,056
So what are you going to do now?

387
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,694
What will I do?

388
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,053
"Why do you fight?
without knowing the reason for your defeat?â€

389
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,814
It turns out I'm not alone in that.

390
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:53,904
Possible...

391
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,298
...Goryeo will be like that too.

392
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,901
I'll try to think about it...

393
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,146
...with a feeling of being in the wilderness.

394
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:07,013
Oh...

395
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:07,721
RESIDENCE...

396
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,816
Please put it there carefully.

397
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,198
After marriage, I want to
decorate your own home.

398
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,332
This is a quality product from Bukwon.

399
00:22:23,702 --> 00:22:26,436
I will go to Bukwon
for a month or two.

400
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:27,871
After that...

401
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,274
...let's have a wedding ceremony.

402
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:33,009
If not, I would like to ask.

403
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:34,878
Why...

404
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,521
...suddenly going to Bukwon?

405
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,655
Ah, that...

406
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,235
You handed over the Goryeo women?

407
00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:49,060
At the Royal Matchmaking Bureau,
I see you.

408
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:53,949
Do you have to do that job?

409
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,580
It's none of a woman's business.

410
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,361
My close friend was brought as a tribute girl.

411
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:02,621
Just pretend not to know.

412
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:03,684
Sir.

413
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,467
If I hand it over this time,

414
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,525
I will be rewarded with wealth.

415
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:11,365
My position in Goryeo will be
become wider and stronger.

416
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:15,584
We will have more
power and wealth,

417
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,047
we will be happy.

418
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,703
<i>"Why do you fight?</i>
<i>without knowing the reason for your defeat?â€</i>

419
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:33,390
<i>It turns out I'm not alone in that.</i>

420
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:34,768
<i>Possible...</i>

421
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,946
<i>...Goryeo will be like that too.</i>

422
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:40,503
<i>I'll try to think about it...</i>

423
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:56,560
...I will not leave you
in the wilderness.

424
00:23:58,555 --> 00:23:59,954
I will be with you.

425
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,198
If so, you should
cancel your wedding.

426
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:05,269
Marriage with
Goryeo royal family...

427
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:07,462
...Are you sure?

428
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:11,505
- That...
- If you want to be together in the wilderness...

429
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,187
...please finish that first.

430
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:37,317
I...

431
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,067
...will not marry Yeongyeongun.

432
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,233
- What?
- What do you mean?

433
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:45,637
Sorry for not letting you know earlier.

434
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,071
But I can't do it.

435
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,414
My child.

436
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,208
How can that be?

437
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:56,619
Is it because your friend became a tribute girl?
If yes, I will change into someone else.

438
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:58,469
Change to someone else and then what?

439
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,797
How could you embarrass me like this?

440
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:08,947
Forgive me.

441
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,715
If you cancel
This marriage is unilateral...

442
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,795
...I will not remain silent.

443
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,981
What should I do?

444
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:19,628
What should I do?

445
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,890
I will make sure that your father
and all your younger siblings,

446
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:24,936
can't set foot
in government.

447
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,098
But...

448
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:28,797
Then, Dad...

449
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:31,045
...please throw me away.

450
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,347
Please let me out...

451
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,594
...from the Min family.

452
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,030
- Wait...
- Won Gyeong!

453
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,040
<i>When you read this letter...</i>

454
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:22,187
<i>...I will cancel my wedding</i>
<i>with Yeongyeongun Wang Ik.</i>

455
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,959
<i>Due to cancel</i>
<i>royal family wedding...</i>

456
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:28,186
<i>...there will definitely be losses afterwards.</i>

457
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:29,513
<i>However,</i>

458
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,756
<i>I won't avoid it.</i>

459
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,539
<i>I want to see you.</i>

460
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,910
