THE QUEEN WHO CROWNS

4
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,369
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND MAY BE DIFFERENT
FROM ACTUAL HISTORICAL RECORDS

00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,053
CHILD ACTORS FILMING SAFELY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH BROADCAST PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:43,911
15 YEARS LATER

7
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:45,231
Take him down!

8
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,531
Drop it!

9
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,444
- Throw it on the ground!
- Come on, drop it!

10
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:50,380
Push back!

11
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:52,708
Drop it!

12
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,935
Drop it!

13
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,771
- Good work.
- Once again!

14
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,270
Once again.

15
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,414
Once again!

16
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,173
Can I fight you one more time?

17
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:05,307
Yes, you can.

18
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,664
Use all your strength this time.

19
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:10,713
Good.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,949
- Come on!
- Come on!

21
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:17,556
Drop it!

22
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:19,842
Use your feet.

23
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,060
Your feet.

24
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,389
Drop it!

25
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:25,494
- Come on!
- Come on!

26
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,771
He deliberately gave in, right?

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,304
He's not the type of person who gives in.

28
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:37,406
He is less strong.

29
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,547
I knew your power was extraordinary.

30
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,050
- Want to try again?
- Okay.

31
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,231
- Drop it!
- Drop it!

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,650
- Good.
- Drop it!

33
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,595
Come on, drop it!

34
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,765
THE QUEEN WHO CROWNS: BEFORE SUNRISE

35
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:09,151
Ouch, it hurts.

36
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:14,743
How many times do I have to tell you?
if you are not strong enough?

37
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,580
There's no way you can beat him
a man that big.

38
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,624
It's been a long time since we were alone like this.

39
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:38,200
I love being in the sun.

40
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,407
My father...

41
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,477
...want to give us grain.

42
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,780
- My wife.
- King...

43
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,683
...freeze all available treasures.

44
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,588
So, we can't give barley seeds.
to the soldiers in the new year.

45
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,192
We have to give
they are something when Dano.

46
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,156
We give according to our ability.

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,773
My soldiers serve me loyally.

48
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,834
Loyalty in words has no power.

49
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:16,255
Loyalty without reward
won't last long.

50
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,476
Add a little more.

51
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:22,945
Furthermore.

52
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,413
- Come here.
- Good grief.

53
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,248
Give it to me.

54
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,684
Hold this.

55
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:34,523
Enough, right?

56
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:36,258
Here.

57
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:38,193
That's too much.

58
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,200
Furthermore.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,172
Chae Ryeong is very agile.

60
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:55,177
But, I'm worried
our grains are not enough.

61
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,181
You have so many soldiers.

62
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:09,291
Convey my thanks to Dad.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,035
You are.

64
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,505
We help him,
but have to be careful around him?

65
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:26,924
I've said it many times
if his ego is high.

66
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,310
You think I don't have an ego?

67
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:33,682
Isn't that Mr. Ha Ryun?

68
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,339
This is <i>surichwi</i> cake.

69
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,731
Please try it.

70
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:52,568
So?

71
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:58,040
Gather more soldiers stealthily.

72
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,375
I think we better get ready.

73
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,258
Is there any movement?

74
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,349
Jeong Do Jeon meets
with the Queen every day.

75
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,518
This is suspicious.

76
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,554
What are they really planning?

77
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,459
Are there any palace people?
who can help us?

78
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,596
We have to know their plans
so that we can be on guard.

79
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:25,817
Young Sil.

80
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,240
A girl named Young Sil
is the Queen's main lady-in-waiting.

81
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,848
I can do anything
if it is for your own good.

82
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:46,882
You just need to find out...

83
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,785
...what Jeong Do Jeon and the Queen
talk about when we meet.

84
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,826
Good.

85
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,061
I will do it.

86
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,653
Take this.

87
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,339
You don't regret marrying me?

88
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,920
What do you mean?

89
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:22,467
If at that time you were married
with Yeongyeongun...

90
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,559
My husband.

91
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:28,497
...you can move to the Ming Dynasty
and become part of their empire.

92
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,001
He was just a man from a ruined dynasty.

93
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,366
If you marry him...

94
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,343
...Goryeo will not be destroyed.

95
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,612
What do you mean?

96
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,983
Everyone says I
the greatest man in Joseon.

97
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:52,821
But, wasn't it you who made me?
become like this?

98
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,394
After killing Jeong Mong Ju...

99
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,066
...I think of you when
swinging the sword like a madman.

100
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,781
I think about what
that I can achieve with you.

101
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:10,372
However...

102
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,158
Now I'm scared
thinking about when I die.

103
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,081
I become a man
the weak and pathetic.

104
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,923
We must not waste
this beautiful season.

105
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,837
What if we go
take a few days off...

106
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:33,662
...to get some fresh air?

107
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,371
Q&amp;A WITH KING JESEON AND MENCIUS

108
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:19,308
This book...

109
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:23,011
...contains a summary of the conversation
between Mencius and King Jeseon.

110
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:27,325
Q&amp;A WITH KING JESEON AND MENCIUS

111
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,462
Why did you give me this book?

112
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:35,959
So that you don't forget our dreams.

113
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:42,071
How to be a king.

114
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,666
A book about royal politics.

115
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:48,270
But this is a forbidden book for me.

116
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,873
There's no one to see here.

117
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,867
Why still call it forbidden?

118
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:17,452
I'll buy some food around here.

119
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:18,834
Okay.

120
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,344
Buy food at the soup kitchen.

121
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:34,049
Good.

122
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:00,570
Mrs.

123
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,477
Aren't you Lady Seo from Daejeon?

124
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:04,179
What? Dayang?

125
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,015
Palace maid?

126
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,518
Are you sure she's a palace maid?

127
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,888
If the palace lady gave birth here...

128
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,120
No. That would cause problems.

129
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:16,424
Get out of this temple right now.

130
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,557
Please help me.

131
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:23,899
I prayed and asked Buddha
so that me and my baby are safe.

132
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,968
- So please...
- Then, his father...

133
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,648
Oh my gosh. I might get kicked out too.

134
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,433
Hurry up and go! Get out of here!

135
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,708
Wait.

136
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,133
I know this woman.

137
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,805
But still...

138
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:39,748
...if this problem spreads...

139
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,557
You can keep this a secret.

140
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:47,789
You're right but...

141
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,154
What if the Chief Monk finds out?

142
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,169
I will explain to him.

143
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,931
Okay, if you insist.

144
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:57,999
- Thank You.
- Yes.

145
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:02,448
Good grief.

146
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,211
I won't ask your reasons.

147
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,815
Give birth to a healthy baby.

148
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:16,418
Mrs.

149
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,487
Thank You.

150
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,696
Please take good care of him.

151
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:31,398
Isn't that one of the teachings of Buddha?

152
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:32,734
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,561
Mr. Ha Ryun suggested
to collect...

154
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,197
...more soldiers
and train them secretly.

155
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,765
It seems the King appointed Jeong Do Jeon...

156
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,321
...in the highest military forces.

157
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:13,649
That means they want
control all the soldiers.

158
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,525
After forming the troops,

159
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,413
we will be attacked
without being able to put up any resistance.

160
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,248
Because of that...

161
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,918
...I want to sell our house.

162
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,345
- Older brother.
- Older brother.

163
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,021
My wife.

164
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:29,033
We need money
to manage the soldiers.

165
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:29,791
Older brother.

166
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,760
To be honest,
the house is not yours.

167
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,296
- It belongs to Dad.
- Do not interfere.

168
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,130
Don't sell the house.

169
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,870
Wouldn't Dad
give me the house?

170
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,738
Excuse me.

171
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,107
We won't sell it.

172
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,577
Promise me that...

173
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,612
...you won't sell the house.

174
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:51,947
I promise, Dad.

175
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:56,017
In that case, I will lend you
the wealth I have.

176
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,555
I'm sorry, Dad.

177
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:01,756
Father.

178
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:03,874
From Gaegyeong to now,

179
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:06,226
...we have to sell
many houses because of him.

180
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,329
That...

181
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,764
I will pay for it.

182
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,207
You know me.

183
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,571
We've gone too far.

184
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,406
Your future sister-in-law...

185
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,909
...is the future of our family.

186
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:35,190
You must be hurt
because of what my younger siblings said.

187
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:40,366
They were also exiled
from an important position in the king's palace.

188
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,754
- So they...
- I understand their feelings.

189
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,935
But why...

190
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,271
...you said you wanted to sell the house
without discussing it with me?

191
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,409
- Even though it was Dad who gave it...
- If we discuss it...

192
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,645
...would you agree?

193
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,615
You must have forbidden me.

194
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,852
"Trust my soldiers."

195
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,954
"They will serve me."

196
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,229
It seems that I am very
sad in your eyes.

197
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:18,054
- What?
- They say I'm the greatest man in Joseon,

198
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,035
but my life is like this.

199
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,844
Life is filled with fear because
Queen and Jeong Do Jeon...

200
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,373
...might come to kill me.

201
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:26,710
So, without the help of my wife...

202
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,210
Why are you talking like we're not family?

203
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:41,890
Forgive me.

204
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:51,332
I know you are stressed and
suffering from various problems.

205
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,469
- But...
- I want you to promise me one thing.

206
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,371
Even if it's just a small problem...

207
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,974
...talk everything to me.

208
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:02,911
Good.

209
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,879
I promise.

210
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,370
Please log in first.

211
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,441
Have you given birth?

212
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,859
Yes, thanks to your help.

213
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,031
They are willing to raise
my son at the temple.

214
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,614
So, I went back to the palace.

215
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,159
I'm pleased to hear it.

216
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,453
What's going on at this time of night?

217
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,368
Young Sil is taken to the queen's palace.

218
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,231
I think it has something to do with it.
with the Madam's family.

219
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,899
What?

220
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:20,822
Her Majesty the Queen.

221
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:30,338
This girl is spying on me
on Jeong An Gun's orders.

222
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:33,068
JEONG AN GUN: LEE BANG WON'S TITLE
WHEN STILL A PRINCE

223
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,804
Weren't you the one who gave him this?

224
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,574
I did give it to him...

225
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,577
...but we didn't tell him to
spying on you.

226
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:44,412
What a rude person.

227
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:48,716
He already admitted it.

228
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,175
It must be because he couldn't stand being whipped.

229
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,524
What did you say?

230
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,227
If he said that...

231
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,197
...he gave a false confession
because he couldn't stand being whipped.

232
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,933
Hard to believe.

233
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:09,559
What are you afraid of?
to do this?

234
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:11,039
Do you...

235
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,309
...want to die?

236
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,757
Before I die at the hands of the Queen...

237
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,546
...let me ask you one thing.

238
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:22,953
Father hates Jeong An Gun,
who is his biological child.

239
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:23,952
So therefore,

240
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,888
he tried to take all the power
owned by Jeong An Gun.

241
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,823
I thought about this for a while.

242
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,992
Since when did he think...

243
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,962
...to kill Jeong Mong Ju.

244
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,173
Kill Jeong Mong Ju...

245
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,542
...with your own hands.

246
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,045
After that...

247
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,414
...I will support you...

248
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,150
...as king after your father.

249
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:58,396
EMPRESS SHINDEOK
LEE SEONG GYE'S SECOND WIFE,

250
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,227
LEE BANG WON'S STEPMOTHER

251
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,558
I want to tell you the fact
to Father.

252
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,831
This woman!

253
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,563
The person who ordered the killing
Jeong Mong Ju is you.

254
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:10,348
Because of that,

255
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,400
stop your hatred for Jeong An Gun.

256
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:16,604
What would you do?

257
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,451
Oh.

258
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:32,987
- Have you arrived?
- Yes.

259
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:35,790
Mrs.

260
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:43,131
I...

261
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:46,875
I didn't say anything
to the Queen.

262
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,070
I mean it.

263
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:51,873
Yes.

264
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,608
Okay.

265
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,176
Come on in.

266
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,181
My wife.

267
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,921
My wife, what happened?

268
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:09,891
Your Honour.

269
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:12,026
Chae Ryeong.

270
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,845
Bring him in.

271
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,896
Good.

272
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,016
So,

273
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,410
The queen who ordered to
kill Jeong Mong Ju...

274
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,817
...and who killed him
is Jeong An Gun.

275
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,114
Is that what you want to say?

276
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,917
- Yes.
- My wife.

277
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:39,187
You think people don't say that
because they don't know?

278
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,822
There is a reason for everything.

279
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,857
When those words came out...

280
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,526
...there will be one person who must die...

281
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,329
...between the Queen and
the person who said that.

282
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,568
The Queen will not let you
just like that.

283
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:57,053
He will shut your mouth
no matter how.

284
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:59,861
- If he sends an assassin...
- If not so...

285
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,409
...Young Sil...

286
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,026
...will not be able to leave the palace.

287
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,626
If not so...

288
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:08,449
...I won't be able to save you.

289
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:27,301
Even if I rule the world,
everything is meaningless...

290
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:30,805
...if I lose you.

291
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,679
I will definitely find a solution
for this problem.

292
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:39,280
So never again,

293
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:41,783
act recklessly alone.

294
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,085
Promise me.

295
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:48,890
Good.

296
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,074
The Queen's son-in-law has acted
impolitely.

297
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:08,843
Please forgive him.

298
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,513
She hates her mother-in-law...

299
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,716
...what can I say?

300
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,024
Her Majesty the Queen.

301
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:17,985
Go.

302
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:22,110
Before I heard
You forgive him...

303
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:23,758
...I won't go.

304
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:27,595
At least your family should be safe.

305
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,638
There is still a way to live.

306
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:35,136
Want me to tell you?

307
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:37,718
Crown Prince,

308
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,840
come here.

309
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,451
Position of Crown Prince,

310
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,483
stolen by my son, Bang Seok.

311
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,985
I know you think so.

312
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:52,636
No.

313
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,554
No, yeah.

314
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,822
In that case...

315
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:58,459
...will you swear allegiance?
to the Crown Prince?

316
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,403
Me, Jeong An Gun, Lee Bang Won...

317
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,106
...swearing loyalty...

318
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:14,909
...to the Crown Prince.

319
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:26,053
There is a saying that words are
the easiest thing in the world.

320
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,089
Swear by prostrating yourself.

321
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,745
Her Majesty the Queen.

322
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,491
Why?

323
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:31,926
Can't you do it?

324
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,965
Promise me you won't hurt...

325
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:40,234
...people around me.

326
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,311
Did something happen?

327
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:28,516
Your face doesn't look good.

328
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,873
There isn't anything.

329
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:32,587
But...

330
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,856
...what makes you
in a hurry to send a message?

331
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:39,227
He said...

332
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:43,240
...His Majesty the King will confiscate
all Jeoljesa weapons.

333
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,324
What?

334
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:48,695
The soldiers already have confidence
what they want to get from Jeoljesa.

335
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,725
So there is a limit to mastering them.

336
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:54,242
But, if weapons are confiscated...

337
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,511
...they can't use
any power.

338
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:03,050
Eventually,
everything they had was taken away...

339
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,387
...and he will stop
and kill me slowly.

340
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:09,997
What happens if
not surrendering weapons?

341
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,292
There is no other way...

342
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,637
...because this is His Majesty's order.

343
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,626
But if I insist
not handing it over?

344
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,999
You will break the order
and must die.

345
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,335
The soldiers will definitely catch you.

346
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,603
Isn't that the same as
ask me to die?

347
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:24,839
Jeong An Gun.

348
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:36,918
They were both away.

349
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:43,691
Your Honour.

350
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:48,896
Brother-in-law.

351
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:50,765
Are you letting go of this house?

352
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:52,442
What do you mean?

353
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,934
I heard the author came too.

354
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,770
But why do you pretend not to know?

355
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,472
Your sister-in-law doesn't know about that.

356
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,408
That was my doing.

357
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:04,065
I promised Dad
that I will not sell it.

358
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,713
This has been approved by Father.

359
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,482
After all, it's the house that was passed down to me.

360
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,580
This is not something that should be
you worry about.

361
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:11,285
My wife.

362
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,390
You must be tired.

363
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:18,197
Come in first.

364
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:18,993
My wife.

365
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,629
This is a problem I need to talk about
with my younger siblings.

366
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:23,664
Young Sil.

367
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:26,013
Your Honour.

368
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,047
Now...

369
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,049
...brother destroyed our family.

370
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,536
- What did you say?
- You throw away wealth,

371
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,920
and also blocking our way.

372
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,489
Plus what's happening in the world
lately.

373
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,890
This marriage,

374
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,614
it shouldn't have happened in the first place.

375
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:53,194
It's better for you two to get a divorce.

376
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,097
Do it now so that we
can get out of this problem.

377
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,440
Brother in law is nothing
compared to you.

378
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:00,476
Your Honour.

379
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,937
Even now I can find you
another husband.

380
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:06,674
Older brother.

381
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,456
Once again you insult Jeong An Gun...

382
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:11,746
...when that happened...

383
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,648
...I will break off the relationship
with you guys.

384
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:18,886
Older brother.

385
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,749
Don't be too surprised after
hear my words now.

386
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,752
Let's end it...

387
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:53,954
...our relationship ends here.

388
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:59,360
Did you hear what my brothers said?

389
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:00,861
Yes.

390
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:02,797
But not because of that.

391
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:04,265
In that case?

392
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,296
I know you better
from anyone in this world.

393
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,136
You are...

394
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,505
...a person who would die for me.

395
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,341
I'm afraid of that.

396
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,410
I'm scared...

397
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,956
...my love kills you.

398
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,167
My husband.

399
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,549
It seems...

400
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,618
...Queen and Sambong did the driving
Father's heart.

401
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:26,761
Not only soldiers...

402
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,923
...they also seized weapons.

403
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,326
I can't take it.

404
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:35,159
I will fight until the end of my life.

405
00:27:35,746 --> 00:27:37,198
But if I die like that,

406
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:38,365
You...

407
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:40,301
...your family...

408
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,484
...and most importantly, our children,
will die too.

409
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:45,172
So...

410
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,476
...if we end our relationship...

411
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,709
You are being selfish.

412
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:52,780
How can you think of dying?
leave your family?

413
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:55,382
My wife.

414
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:57,518
If asked to surrender weapons...

415
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,753
...then hand it over.

416
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,155
What do you mean?

417
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,478
Come here.

418
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:14,328
What is all this?

419
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:21,235
I heard they're going to collect
soldiers and weapons of the princes.

420
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,739
So, this is it?

421
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:28,075
The weapons I prepared secretly.

422
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:30,141
When the time comes,

423
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,513
this is the power you must use.

424
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,724
"I am truly grateful
you prepared this...

425
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,020
...secretly."

426
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,122
"Thank You."

427
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,971
Should I thank you?
like this?

428
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:45,959
My husband.

429
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,821
I always wanted,

430
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:50,097
walking in the same steps with you.

431
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:53,033
But you...

432
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,803
...always walk one step at a time
in front of leaving me.

433
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:00,374
This is...

434
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:04,011
...the way I love you.

435
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,553
<i>This is...</i>

436
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:49,657
<i>...the way I love you.</i>

437
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:43,068
