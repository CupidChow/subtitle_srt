1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:10,777
You're okay?

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,678
Yeah.

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,613
It's become a hassle.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,949
It's a hassle.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,090
RESTAURANT WORKER

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,026
Please work with me.

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,030
Ikuo is cute. He has a big smile.

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,264
I'll do my best.

9
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,241
When I looked to the side,

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,510
one of them didn't have their hand raised.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,079
I almost raised my fist.

12
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,848
Will you talk to him when you get back?

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,951
I think he'll come talk to me.

14
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,455
He feels secure in your relationship.

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,456
Yeah, he does.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,959
But it's not my style
to make him feel insecure.

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,396
-You want him to feel secure.
-Exactly, feeling secure is…

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,198
But you aren't a couple yet.

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,099
No, we aren't.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,468
Then is it even necessary?

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,103
Well,

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,810
if I feel he's taking
my feelings too lightly,

23
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,345
or if he starts acting spoiled,

24
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,817
then I'll be like,
"Don't take this for granted."

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,156
What should I do?

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,293
What's done is done.

27
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,697
-Are you worried?
-I'm worried.

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,599
Why didn't you raise your hand?

29
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,735
Well, I thought it was already decided--

30
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,471
-Were you overwhelmed?
-Yeah.

31
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,373
Well, I can understand that.

32
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,478
I didn't feel like working the truck.

33
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,583
Well, I think…

34
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:03,089
it's going to keep happening.
Me getting in a bad mood.

35
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,091
Even if one issue is resolved,

36
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,162
others will pop up,
and I'll be in a bad mood again.

37
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,266
I'm troublesome.

38
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,437
I think I'm a troublesome person.

39
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,073
So he knows himself.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,108
He needs attention.

41
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,847
What I like most about Shun

42
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:39,352
is that he doesn't try
to just smooth things over,

43
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:44,224
and he's too honest
and says what he thinks.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,328
In some ways, that makes him trustworthy.

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,464
What about how he didn't raise his hand?

46
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,934
I don't know why he didn't,

47
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,104
but I want him to explain it to me
in his own words.

48
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,274
He did message me, at least.

49
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,342
What did he say?

50
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:03,876
Well…

51
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,747
"I was tired after that debate
and didn't feel like going to work."

52
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,682
"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings."

53
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,418
"I wanted to go with you,
but I just couldn't."

54
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,854
I wouldn't forgive him
if it was just this,

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,392
but one hour later, he sent me
a random picture of a frog.

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,863
When he does things like that,
I can't help but find him adorable.

57
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,901
-He found them.
-Cute.

58
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,205
I need to really think about things too.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,708
It'd be better if he just said,
"Sorry, I can't see you like that."

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,776
You mean Kazuto?

61
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,544
I want him to just spit it out.

62
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,315
-Why don't you make him say it?
-Maybe I will.

63
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,418
Like, "What do you really think about me?"
Then I can let it go.

64
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,253
What are you gonna do after?

65
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,257
I'll try to think things through.

66
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,894
-You'll take the photo?
-Yeah.

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,929
-Ready?
-Okay.

68
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:57,864
Here we go.

69
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,833
How is it?

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,734
It's crazy!

71
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,803
Let me see!

72
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,638
Please.

73
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,407
Super cute!

74
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,543
Incredible.

75
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,712
-I'll think about it.
-About what?

76
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,281
Other ways to take cute photos.

77
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,850
Oh yeah. I'll think of ideas too.

78
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,952
-We can think about it together.
-Right.

79
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,022
They're having fun.

80
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,624
They're good friends.

81
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,726
-We're back.
-We've come back.

82
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,994
Oh, welcome back!

83
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,629
We're back.

84
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,697
How was your day?

85
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,532
-It was fun.
-Yes, it was fun.

86
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,967
-You guys are cute.
-Thanks.

87
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,575
And so…

88
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,476
Hey, Dai.

89
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,346
Can you come to the first floor?

90
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,413
-Right now?
-Yeah.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,348
Sure.

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,118
-I'm here.
-Thanks, I appreciate it.

93
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,054
Are you upset about today?

94
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,123
Not upset.

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,325
But I was just shocked.

96
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,531
It may sound like an excuse,
but can I explain?

97
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,432
Sure.

98
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,770
Before the shift was announced,

99
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,606
some stuff happened.

100
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,509
It felt like a hassle,

101
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,947
and I was mentally exhausted.

102
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,619
I messaged you the reason already, but…

103
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,291
You said something like, "I wanted
to work with you, but I just couldn't."

104
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,595
Your choice of words felt like
you were pushing me away.

105
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:41,134
There might've been a better way
for you to deal with this.

106
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,102
That's how I feel.

107
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,982
Do you have more to say?

108
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:56,916
No.

109
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,794
-Once again.
-That's not good.

110
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,228
Come on, Shun.

111
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,298
-Things don't always go the way you want.
-They don't.

112
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, that's it.

113
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,036
What Dai said in the end wasn't wrong.

114
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,472
He's feeling down.

115
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,382
What's up?

116
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,587
Something happened?

117
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,825
You look quite sad.

118
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,229
FROM KOREA, DESIGNER

119
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,697
I talked with him.

120
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,238
Things got even worse.

121
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,273
Really?

122
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,276
It's because

123
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,681
I haven't apologized.

124
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,518
I don't think I have…

125
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,356
any reason to apologize.

126
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:16,262
Well, I hurt his feelings.

127
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,599
I feel bad about that.

128
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,837
But I'm not obligated to volunteer.

129
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,905
That's true.

130
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,906
Yeah.

131
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,576
I'm getting confused.

132
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
What you're saying is true.

133
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,682
Raising your hand or not is up to you.

134
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,317
We're not officially dating yet.

135
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,853
I like him, but I'm not head over heels.

136
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,625
Even if you were,
you still don't have to raise your hand.

137
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,326
But, you know,

138
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,596
you said you felt bad, right?

139
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,864
I did, yeah.

140
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,966
In that case…

141
00:08:55,167 --> 00:09:01,240
it's true you have a choice,
but you knew you hurt his feelings.

142
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,112
You can think about what's fair later.

143
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,148
That's not what you should focus on now.

144
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,019
"I made you sad."

145
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,321
"I'm sorry."

146
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,222
Yeah.

147
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,026
-Taeheon!
-That was wonderful advice, Taeheon.

148
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,328
His advice is kind and right.

149
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,031
You can say,
"Let's work together next time."

150
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,802
You're right.

151
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,939
Thank you.

152
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,024
Will he be like, "Again"?
Do you think it's okay?

153
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,454
Is that in your dialect?

154
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,656
Yeah. It means "finish your plate."

155
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,958
Hey, Dai, about earlier…

156
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,961
-Sorry to interrupt.
-No problem.

157
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,529
You know,

158
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,899
there's one thing I couldn't say to you.

159
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:36,902
Well…

160
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:38,938
Today,

161
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,674
by not raising my hand,

162
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,811
I made you feel shocked and sad.

163
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,347
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,722
Thank you.

165
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,324
I wanted to hear that.

166
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,630
Thank you.

167
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,531
Yeah.

168
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,739
You came to see me for that.

169
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,442
I'm happy.

170
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,679
Thank you.

171
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,749
Dinner is ready.
Is everyone in the dining room?

172
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,650
They are?

173
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,153
Thank you, Shun.

174
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,088
We'll be in the dining room soon.

175
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:29,989
I got it.

176
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,923
Yeah.

177
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,170
That's what you had to do!

178
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,240
Shun is trying to change himself
little by little, step by step.

179
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,909
-Good job!
-He said he was sorry.

180
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,312
He couldn't do that before.

181
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,780
But Taeheon…

182
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,983
-I was impressed with his advice.
-That was great!

183
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,719
Without hurting Shun's feelings,

184
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,622
he opened Shun's eyes
and encouraged him to take action.

185
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:09,428
With repeated experience, they can learn
to say "thanks" and "sorry" to each other.

186
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,098
Some things you can only discover
through arguments.

187
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,101
Each other's dislikes, for example.

188
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,504
And Dai's expression
after Shun said, "I'm sorry."

189
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,005
What a great expression.

190
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,110
That's an expression
an actor would struggle to recreate.

191
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,178
-No, they couldn't.
-Right?

192
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,181
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

193
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,783
Cheers.

194
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,825
Hey, can I ask you something?

195
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,195
We're all gay guys, right?

196
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,364
Some of us might be bisexual.

197
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,934
Do you tell your parents
about your relationships?

198
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,337
-I can tell them everything.
-You can?

199
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,838
What was their reaction?

200
00:12:53,939 --> 00:13:00,780
I think my mother had more
motherly concerns than I was expecting.

201
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,984
Everyone else too? Do your parents know?

202
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,453
Yeah, they know.

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,289
I told them
once I knew I was on this show.

204
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,190
Really?

205
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,358
That's wonderful.

206
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,729
I didn't want them hearing about it
from someone else.

207
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,999
Did your mom take it well?

208
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,868
She said, "If you find someone nice,
bring them by."

209
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,870
From now on.

210
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,544
Truthfully, I tried to tell my parents
before joining this show,

211
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,081
but I haven't been able to tell them yet.

212
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,318
Well, in fact,

213
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,188
my parents divorced when I was ten,

214
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:46,192
and I was raised by my grandma.

215
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:52,164
Then I went to a boarding school in Korea
and studied abroad after that.

216
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,734
I'm still a ten-year-old boy
in my parents' minds.

217
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,436
Oh, I see.

218
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,005
We've been apart for so long,

219
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,375
it's awkward both for me and for them.

220
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,946
Since we don't know each other very well,

221
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,815
I have to be careful of how I tell them.

222
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,917
So I'm curious to know

223
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,253
how you all came out to your parents.

224
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,821
What made you come out?

225
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,057
How did they react?

226
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,559
I'd love to know.

227
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,297
I told my parents during the last Obon.

228
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,333
What made you do that?

229
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,504
I had a dilemma about my ex
and wanted their advice.

230
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:37,643
So it wasn't really about coming out,

231
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,080
but more that I wanted their advice.

232
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,353
I didn't think coming out
to my parents would be an issue,

233
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,155
but they seemed sadder than I expected.

234
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,960
I thought they would be
totally fine about it,

235
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,530
but they seemed sadder than I expected,

236
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,999
which made me sad too.

237
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,768
Whether it's Korea or Japan,

238
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,906
I don't think the country or culture
matters so much.

239
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:11,143
You said your mom seemed sad, right?

240
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,044
Yeah.

241
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,148
My mom will likely have
the same type of reaction.

242
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,052
That's what I'm expecting.

243
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm afraid to come out.

244
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,756
It can be scary.

245
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,693
I'm a bit worried,
but hearing your experiences,

246
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,364
I thought it may give me the boost I need.

247
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,599
That's why I asked.

248
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:41,173
Even if your dad and mom
don't accept your sexuality,

249
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,844
there's meaning and value
to the fact you're here.

250
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:53,419
Your existence
doesn't need to be influenced by that.

251
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,455
Listening to you made me feel that way.

252
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,923
I agree with Dai.

253
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,795
There's a lot that children learn
from their parents,

254
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,566
but there's also a lot
that parents learn from their kids too.

255
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,936
When you choose your own happiness,

256
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,039
it may mean a totally new experience
for your parents,

257
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,977
and they may be surprised
because they know so little about it.

258
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,080
But even if their reactions
are not what you expect,

259
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:27,386
I believe your choice
is a precious message for them.

260
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,790
Thanks for sharing
and for listening to me.

261
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,158
Same goes for us.

262
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,901
Coming out is not a requirement.

263
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,505
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Do what's right for you.

264
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:51,677
In my case, my mother passed away
before I came out.

265
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,381
I came out to my father after that.

266
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,584
But my father,
who I thought was rather conservative,

267
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,519
accepted it surprisingly well.

268
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:05,124
Our sexuality isn't necessarily about sex
but about our identities.

269
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,025
Of course.

270
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,460
You tell someone
what kind of person you are,

271
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,696
and if they accept you for it,

272
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,065
that can feel very self-affirming.

273
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,136
Kazuto said his mother looked sad,
but we don't know why she was sad.

274
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,872
Is she sad about the fact he's gay?

275
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,942
Or is she saddened
by the thought that her gay son

276
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,579
must navigate a society
that may be more challenging to live in?

277
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,514
That's right.

278
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,083
You won't know until you talk about it.

279
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,920
"Sad" doesn't necessarily mean
she's sad he's gay.

280
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,823
-It's not a rejection.
-Right, it may not be.

281
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,730
As long as they continue
on a path that makes them happy,

282
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,299
I think the parents will be happy.

283
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,667
I hope so.

284
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,907
There's one person
I want to properly get to know.

285
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,577
I just need a little time with him.

286
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,678
Oh, great.

287
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,947
-You mean just the two of you?
-Sure, why not?

288
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,415
Sure you can.

289
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,616
Then turn it over.

290
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,385
-Turn it over?
-That's a good idea!

291
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,253
Okay, let's use the name cards.

292
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,056
Ikuo said it's okay.

293
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,325
Give us a sign, Ikuo.

294
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,259
Okay.

295
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,564
Let's go.

296
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,767
Good luck.

297
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,935
See you.

298
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,770
I also wanna talk to Kazuto later.

299
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,073
-Let's talk.
-Yeah.

300
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,676
I'm wondering something.

301
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,313
-Ryota's going for it too.
-Oh, that's great.

302
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:42,154
I'm still very interested in you.

303
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,823
Even now.

304
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,228
When you said you didn't know me yet,

305
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,566
I thought you were willing
to get to know me.

306
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,034
Just my selfish expectation.

307
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,772
I don't plan on giving up right now.

308
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,616
How do you see me right now?

309
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,185
That's what I'd like to know.

310
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,158
The Ikuo around everybody else

311
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,161
and the Ikuo who was with me at the truck

312
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,831
are two totally different people.

313
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:32,271
The Ikuo when we're alone
is someone I'd like to get to know,

314
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,808
but not so much the person you are
when you're with everyone else.

315
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:46,485
Someone who can't live without me…

316
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,722
It's just my own preference,

317
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,394
but that's the sort of person
I tend to be attracted to.

318
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:02,734
I can't help but feel that, for you,
it doesn't have to be me.

319
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,779
He felt he had to be clear with him.

320
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,081
Yes, since Ikuo pressed him for an answer.

321
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,216
Right.

322
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,319
Are you cold? Are you okay?

323
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,853
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

324
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,867
I feel like I haven't talked
with you much recently.

325
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:41,773
So when Ikuo asked you to come here,
it made me want to talk to you too.

326
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,674
Yeah.

327
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,612
The other day…

328
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,016
you said you had feelings for me.

329
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,485
After that,

330
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:00,125
I thought a lot about
what kind of person you are to me.

331
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,398
I think that the "like" you feel for me
and the "like" I feel for you

332
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,600
may be different.

333
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,172
Since pretty much the beginning,

334
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,176
you've been easy to talk to,
maybe since we're the same age.

335
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,114
I feel comfortable with you.

336
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:28,387
So the feelings aren't romantic for me,

337
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,788
but rather,

338
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,959
they are feelings of friendship.

339
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,728
I don't want to ruin that.

340
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,232
I got this strange idea in my head,

341
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,235
which is why I might have been
pushing you away.

342
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,139
I was a little afraid, I guess.

343
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:54,513
Afraid of ruining this connection I had
with you in my mind.

344
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:02,154
I think it was good
that you told me your honest feelings.

345
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,855
I guess.

346
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,162
When you're with Shun,

347
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:16,301
I like seeing you guys
mess around with each other.

348
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,839
Yeah, you laugh a lot.

349
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,875
I really like that feeling

350
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,978
when you laugh at us teasing each other.

351
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,314
It's like, "Oh, Kazuto laughed."

352
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,950
That's something that was really

353
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,188
very important for me.

354
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,158
I really like when you laugh,

355
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,263
so even without the romance,
I've wanted to see you smile.

356
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,802
But I haven't seen it recently,

357
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,573
and I've missed that.

358
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,376
So, yeah,

359
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,980
I was sad, like,
"Oh, Kazuto hasn't smiled much."

360
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:03,915
So,

361
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,754
now that we know how we each feel,

362
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,156
I think that

363
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,760
we can enjoy our time together.

364
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,195
Yeah.

365
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,770
Let's enjoy our time.

366
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:25,704
Yeah.

367
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:28,874
Thank you.

368
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,841
Yeah.

369
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,788
Oh, of course it was still a shock.

370
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,689
-He gave his best.
-He loved him so much.

371
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,591
Ryota had strong feelings for Kazuto.

372
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,827
He's been devoted to him.

373
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,702
-It dinged. "This is a notice for you."
-Yes.

374
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,605
"The coffee truck will be closed today."

375
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,507
It's closed.

376
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,412
"You are going on your last private date."

377
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,580
-The last?
-The last.

378
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,881
This is the last date.

379
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,083
The last private date.

380
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,287
"Write down the name of the person
you want to go with."

381
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:20,292
"You can only go on the date
if your feelings are mutual."

382
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,297
Dai and Shun will go on a date.

383
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,499
I want to know Kazuto's feelings.

384
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:32,304
Only one couple has been able to go
to this event each time.

385
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,841
"Now we will announce the pairs
going on the private date."

386
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,142
The first pair is…

387
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,651
Shun.

388
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,359
Dai.

389
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,763
FIRST PAIR
SHUN AND DAI

390
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,897
I'm relieved.

391
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,436
The second pair is…

392
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,804
The second pair?

393
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,307
Is that what it means?

394
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,948
Kazuto.

395
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,592
Alan.

396
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:37,028
SECOND PAIR
KAZUTO AND ALAN

397
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,029
I'm glad.

398
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,504
The third pair is…

399
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,273
-What?
-What?

400
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,909
The third pair.

401
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,277
-What?
-No way.

402
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,945
-Who?
-Who on earth?

403
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,789
Ryota.

404
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,430
He looks so happy.

405
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,265
He looks happy.

406
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,241
Gensei.

407
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,342
-Really?
-Okay!

408
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,177
THIRD PAIR
RYOTA AND GENSEI

409
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,679
Let's have fun.

410
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,447
It's making me blush.

411
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,218
-Amazing.
-We're happy too.

412
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,291
-They look happy.
-I'm glad.

413
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,128
-Yay!
-What? This is wonderful.

414
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,596
Three pairs is a first!

415
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,998
I'm an adult.
Why am I so happy for someone's date?

416
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,934
-We're like, "I'm happy."
-We're happy!

417
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,971
We've seen how Gensei has changed.

418
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,142
He's only had sad experiences
with romance so far,

419
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,243
so I'm glad.

420
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,512
Ryota has changed gears.

421
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,982
We don't know if this is friendship
or love for him,

422
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,451
but isn't it wonderful how he's moving on?

423
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,520
-That's important.
-It's wonderful.

424
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,588
It's because he conveyed his feelings…

425
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:11,923
He did all he could.

426
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,325
…that he was able to move on in love.

427
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,860
That's what it means.

428
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:20,031
-And Kazuto, unexpectedly…
-Alan!

429
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,200
Alan took a step back for a while, right?

430
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,102
-Maybe that's what worked?
-Maybe.

431
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,005
His stance was,
"If you aren't ready, I'll wait."

432
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,440
That may have worked.

433
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,574
That's true.

434
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,376
I'm glad. I wish them luck.

435
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,411
I hope their dates will go well.

436
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,047
But I kind of wanna see
Dai and Shun argue one more time.

437
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,482
Just a little.

438
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,718
-Don't worry, they will.
-You're right.

439
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,685
They will.

440
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,855
I'm already having fun.

441
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,890
Where's our room?

442
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,759
Where is it?

443
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,963
Go inside.

444
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,203
That's lit!

445
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,104
Incredible!

446
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,372
Insane!

447
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,307
It's sleek.

448
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,241
Yeah.

449
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,512
Did you know I'd write your name today?

450
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,446
Yeah.

451
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,251
Was it hard to decide?

452
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,252
Of course not.

453
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,622
There's no way.

454
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,394
But the last time, I said,
"All right!" Do you remember?

455
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,998
I was way too expressive then.

456
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,901
I felt embarrassed about it later on.

457
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,337
Not this time, right?

458
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,438
This time.

459
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,749
Were you like that?

460
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,650
Yeah.

461
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,951
You held back?

462
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,319
-I did.
-Why?

463
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,657
Of course it's gonna be exciting
for those who can go on a date.

464
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,259
But for those who can't,

465
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,961
it's awkward.

466
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,398
I calmed myself down.

467
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,234
But I was so happy.

468
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:08,540
At the end of the day, I have fun
and feel at home with you.

469
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,541
I'm glad.

470
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,411
I'm so happy to hear that.

471
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,948
What is this place?

472
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,383
What will their date be like?

473
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,818
Amazing!

474
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,520
Hello.

475
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,822
-Hello.
-Hello.

476
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,391
-Thanks for having us.
-Nice to meet you.

477
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,059
Glasswork!

478
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,460
That's perfect.

479
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,629
It's perfect for these two!

480
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,266
Slowly. Relax your shoulders.

481
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,008
Let's open this.

482
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,310
Let me see.

483
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,112
Pretty.

484
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,848
Beautiful.

485
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,617
Take a look in the mirror.

486
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,289
-I'm so happy with this.
-Me too.

487
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,124
I think it's cute.

488
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,062
KAMOGAWA BAUM BAKERY

489
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,700
I often go to cafés for dates.

490
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,201
-I like cafés too.
-Yeah.

491
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,972
I want to have a relaxing,
stylish dinner at the house.

492
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,940
We can't usually do that.

493
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,508
This is an ideal date.

494
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,778
What do you wanna eat?

495
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,080
Stew.

496
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,015
Sounds good. Perfect for this weather.

497
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,783
Yeah, it's a bit cold today.

498
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,087
-We made a necklace and went to a café.
-Yes, the café.

499
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,489
-And going back home for dinner.
-To cook dinner.

500
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,523
It's perfect.

501
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,763
This place…

502
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,065
I like this place.

503
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,368
-Yeah.
-The breeze feels nice.

504
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,070
It's gonna be great at night for sure.

505
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,574
Amazing.

506
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,043
It's so nice.

507
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,545
-It is.
-It's spacious.

508
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,316
Were you worried?

509
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,217
Me?

510
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,818
Today?

511
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,353
Until my name was called,

512
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,757
I couldn't really smile.

513
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,697
Since we couldn't… go before,

514
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,935
I think this time with you
will be even more special.

515
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,404
I'm excited.

516
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,315
What were your relationships like?

517
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,417
My relationships were lame.

518
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,519
Most of them?

519
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,420
Yeah.

520
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,357
First of all,
I didn't date anyone until I was 18.

521
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,860
I had never had sex or even a kiss.

522
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,832
Except for the last one from New York,

523
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,469
I want to erase my memories.

524
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,507
Besides that one, they were all toxic.

525
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,609
They were just good-looking.

526
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,812
I'm ashamed of my past self.

527
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:05,016
Like, "Why did I fall for this guy?"

528
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,920
I've never been hung up on
anyone in my life.

529
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,521
I see.

530
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,225
The only time in my life

531
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,296
my feelings have been tossed around

532
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,764
is with you.

533
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,335
And

534
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,138
the fact I met a person like you,

535
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,241
through whatever brought us together,

536
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,645
has been a learning experience for me.

537
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,048
So

538
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,217
I'm enjoying it very much.

539
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,651
Yeah.

540
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,262
The steak is ready.

541
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,531
-This has to be good.
-No way it's not.

542
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,467
-Let's just eat it with salt.
-Yeah.

543
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,538
Delish!

544
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,880
Delicious!

545
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,133
What was that?

546
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,568
Wait! No way!

547
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,072
That was great. It's funny
when you don't expect it from them.

548
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,910
Today, we're gonna
stay together overnight.

549
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:44,849
I want to know… where your feelings are.

550
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,187
When I thought it over,

551
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,389
I realized I'm someone

552
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,960
who observes the person
I'm interested in from afar.

553
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,365
Like how they are with everyone.

554
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,137
I realized
I like getting to know someone slowly.

555
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:11,109
Then that overnight date suddenly

556
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,946
gave us all this time alone together.

557
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,182
It just felt too overwhelming for me.

558
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,189
I think that's why I was feeling that way
after we went home.

559
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,258
But this time

560
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,695
is different from the last date.

561
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,064
We got back to being friends…

562
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,768
Well, that may not be
the right way to put it.

563
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,374
But it alleviated my worries
and let me be myself, like I said before.

564
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,476
I was able to do that.

565
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,179
Thanks to that,

566
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,184
the past few days
have been really enjoyable.

567
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,452
We had fun, right?

568
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,487
Yeah, I felt comfortable with you.

569
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,789
The reason I wrote your name today

570
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,393
is because I want
to slowly get to know you more.

571
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:09,500
The process of writing down names
and getting paired up

572
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,969
gets everyone strangely worked up,

573
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,672
but for me, well,

574
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:20,411
it's an opportunity to see various sides
of someone I'm interested in.

575
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,581
I don't know, but I would rather

576
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,084
not have to worry too much about it,
you know?

577
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,622
When Kazuto is speaking with Alan,

578
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,425
he talks more naturally
than anyone else does.

579
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,860
You're right.

580
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,595
He's not overly friendly

581
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,764
and just more natural.

582
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,465
He's not trying too hard.

583
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:46,370
Alan is adjusting to Kazuto's pace
little by little right now, right?

584
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,674
Cut the garlic, please.

585
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,575
Okay.

586
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,311
You're always polite with me, Ryota.

587
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,245
Yes.

588
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,814
-Should I not be?
-No.

589
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,584
-Then I'll stop.
-Yes, stop.

590
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,554
How big should I cut them?

591
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,089
Thin slices?

592
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,357
Thin slices.

593
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,826
Try one. I think it's good.

594
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,861
So hot.

595
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,264
You ate the whole bite?

596
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,900
-It's delicious.
-No wonder it's hot.

597
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,103
Cheers.

598
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,638
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

599
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,412
It has bacon in it.

600
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,349
I think it gave the soup great flavor.

601
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,552
Mmm, it's delicious.

602
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,024
I've always wanted a date like this.

603
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,527
This is kind of my ideal date.

604
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,298
It's like everything came true in a day.

605
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,503
Why did you write my name today?

606
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,508
Well, before…

607
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,945
I wrote your name for the first date.

608
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:05,983
The person I wanted to go on a date with
has always been the same.

609
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,219
Thank you.

610
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,488
But I didn't think I'd be able to.

611
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:11,889
Today.

612
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,227
Did it take time to decide who to write?

613
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,161
No.

614
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,031
It didn't take much time.

615
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,632
-It didn't take long?
-No.

616
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:28,105
My feelings were sorted out
when I woke up this morning.

617
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,775
So I didn't hesitate.

618
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,179
So this is what it feels like
to get to go on a date.

619
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,882
To have our names called.

620
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,784
I just felt happy about it.

621
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,354
That we both wanted to go
and were able to do so.

622
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,022
It's a new feeling.

623
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:52,863
I thought I knew you,
but I didn't really yet.

624
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,432
Has your impression changed?

625
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,801
It's the same in a good way.

626
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,438
I got to see more of your good qualities.

627
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,810
We have a similar vibe when we talk.

628
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,845
That makes me comfortable.

629
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,080
-That's true.
-Right?

630
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,215
I feel we're similar in many ways.

631
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,519
I'm glad I could get to see
more of your good side.

632
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,856
I'm flattered.

633
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,496
Those two are a perfect match.
Like a married couple.

634
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,998
Their voice volume is the same.

635
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,333
But voice volume is…

636
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,135
-Important.
-Yeah.

637
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,899
-Good night, Kazuto.
-Good night.

638
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,409
We see each other every day now.

639
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,309
Yeah.

640
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,280
I wonder how we'd feel
if we didn't see each other for a while.

641
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,048
Yeah, same.

642
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,018
Would we message each other every minute?

643
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,855
Most people aren't that crazy.

644
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,090
-Every minute?
-You never know.

645
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,592
Do you tend to message a lot?

646
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,629
I did in those toxic relationships.

647
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,997
What about the last one?

648
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,700
We didn't need to do that
in our relationship.

649
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,636
You guys were together every day?

650
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,472
What did you like about him?

651
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,408
The biggest part was

652
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,113
when we went
to his family's place in Atlanta.

653
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,752
And there was a family gathering.

654
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:03,227
I witnessed a perfect family
with no flaws.

655
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,362
I see.

656
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,398
There was his father, mother,

657
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,235
cousins, and older siblings.

658
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,339
And everyone got along very well.

659
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,374
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

660
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,243
I was shocked.

661
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,147
-Like, "Such a thing actually exists?"
-Yeah.

662
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:30,421
It made me want to have
a family gathering like that too.

663
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,658
Are you

664
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,597
someone who believes
that male couples can have children,

665
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:45,970
raise them, and be able
to build a happy family?

666
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,505
Do you believe in that?

667
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,474
Yeah, as long as I can afford to.

668
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,211
Financially and mentally.

669
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,180
-Why?
-That's good.

670
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,784
That's something I strongly believe.

671
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:06,123
Nothing would be better than
sharing that with a like-minded partner.

672
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,394
I'm getting sleepy.

673
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,133
Okay, you wanna go to bed?

674
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,570
-You just wanna lie around a bit, right?
-Yeah.

675
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,776
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

676
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,578
Today?

677
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,214
I'll hold this and talk next to you.

678
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,115
Okay.

679
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,449
Ouch!

680
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,752
That looked painful.

681
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,559
Be careful.

682
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:54,171
They both have strong feelings
about what a family is.

683
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,206
Yes, Dai too.

684
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,809
They both agree on that.

685
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,478
They're a good match.

686
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,646
But in Japan,

687
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:07,051
it's still very difficult
for a male couple to adopt children.

688
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,888
I think "family" can take many forms.

689
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:11,822
I agree.

690
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,724
We have so many choices nowadays.

691
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,428
And people are pretty accepting
of however others want to live.

692
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,064
But the social system hasn't caught up.

693
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,001
If only our society
could have systems in place

694
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,271
that would allow us to make
the choices we want.

695
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,973
I sincerely hope for this.

696
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,342
I agree. Next is the weather forecast.

697
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,512
Wait a minute.

698
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,815
Stop talking like a news presenter.

699
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,086
But, you know…

700
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:43,954
What?

701
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,422
Nothing.

702
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,292
-What?
-It's nothing.

703
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,099
Are you getting sleepy, sir?

704
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,535
I'll sleep there.

705
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,882
Hey.

706
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,052
Use my arm as a pillow.

707
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:16,987
Why?

708
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,924
We can be closer that way.

709
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,167
You should've brought your pillow.

710
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,083
-Is this not a good idea?
-No.

711
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,985
It's good.

712
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,589
-Huh?
-It's totally good.

713
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,178
Shun.

714
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,848
Were you waiting?

715
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,584
You kept me waiting too long.

716
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,921
We finally did it.

717
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,429
-Oh my gosh!
