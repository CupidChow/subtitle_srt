1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:10,610
Let's do this.

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,644
Water the plants?

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,612
Yeah.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,552
MODEL AND CAFÉ MANAGER

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,490
FROM TAIWAN, HAIR & MAKEUP ARTIST

6
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,693
It doesn't matter
if you're here for love or friendship.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,098
I think there are things
you can only say because you're here.

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,070
I hope that all of you will cherish
this opportunity, share your feelings,

9
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,640
and finish your stay here…

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,710
at the Green Room.

11
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:50,850
Watching Usak speak…

12
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:56,489
He expressed what he wanted to
and did what he set out to do. No regrets.

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,526
It really left an impression.

14
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,863
I believe seeing it through to the end
is important.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,167
There are a few days left,

16
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,871
but I want to do everything I can.

17
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,609
Do we have any syrup?

18
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,011
There's chocolate syrup.

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,312
-Chocolate.
-Café mocha.

20
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,847
That sounds good!

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,315
-I want some.
-We can make it.

22
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,983
I can make café mocha.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,552
-Can you make it?
-Yeah.

24
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,088
-Will you make me one?
-Sure.

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,024
Ryota is going to make one for me.

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,158
What? I'm jealous.

27
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,394
Ryota is going to make one for me.

28
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,963
Ryota is going to make one for me.

29
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,431
"For me."

30
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,533
"For me." Are you guys listening?

31
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,405
That's amazing!

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,075
Here.

33
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,579
Thank you.

34
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,114
Should I make one?

35
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,615
I see.

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,694
Oh, with Ryota's back.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,063
Oh my!

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,431
Implying, "That's my guy."

39
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,166
Will he see it later?

40
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,772
PLEASE DISCUSS AND DECIDE
WHO WILL TAKE TODAY'S SHIFT

41
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,807
Who wants to work the truck today?

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,244
I wanna work with Ryota.

43
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,845
Let's go, then.

44
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,813
Yeah.

45
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,116
No objections?

46
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,586
Why do you want to go?

47
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,421
I want to go with Ryota…

48
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,322
Cute.

49
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,489
You're so cute.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,258
We welcome that kind of opinion.

51
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,159
Why?

52
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,660
That's so cute.

53
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,029
I want to work with you.

54
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:50,930
Let's go.

55
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,534
Let's have fun.

56
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:03,109
At first, I misunderstood
that Ryota had feelings for me.

57
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,445
I'm still very attracted to him.

58
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,514
I enjoy talking with him.

59
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,483
It feels comfortable.

60
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,458
Hello. Would you like some coffee?

61
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,525
Hello.

62
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,061
Coffee is available.

63
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,730
Do you have an iced drip coffee?

64
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,897
We do.

65
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,966
Please give us a few minutes.

66
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,169
Were you taking a walk nearby?

67
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,738
Yes, we were.

68
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,672
The two of you?

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes.

70
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,775
How nice. He's smiling a lot.

71
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,145
Here. Thank you for waiting.

72
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,613
-Can you hold it?
-Thank you.

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,948
Thank you.

74
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,116
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

75
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,117
He's cute.

76
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,119
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,689
-Hello.
-Hello. Would you like some coffee?

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,091
How do you like it?

79
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,960
It's refreshing. The aroma is great.

80
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,395
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

81
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,263
It has some Ethiopian beans, so…

82
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,399
-I like the acidity.
-Yes, it's acidic.

83
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,437
Colombian beans tend to be acidic,
so you may be tasting that.

84
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,039
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

85
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,407
Thank you for your time.

86
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,943
You're cute when you're serious.

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,280
I usually work like this at my café.

88
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,589
You know what?

89
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,125
From the beginning,

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,730
I've wanted to talk with you.

91
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,599
Almost since day one.

92
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,401
-Really?
-Yeah.

93
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,706
The first time you asked me
to work the coffee truck with you,

94
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,842
I was happy and kind of surprised.

95
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,778
And remember the first date event?

96
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,313
I wrote your name.

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,214
What?

98
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,485
I'm surprised. Are you serious?

99
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,689
Well, we didn't go,
but here at this coffee truck,

100
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,292
this could be considered a date, right?

101
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,094
Yes, you're right.

102
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,432
That being said, I have a gift for you.

103
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,367
What?

104
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,536
I have a gift for you. This.

105
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,441
-Please open it.
-Thank you.

106
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,413
Hey, wait.

107
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,715
I bought it for you.

108
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,850
What?

109
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,784
Thank you.

110
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,087
Oh, it's cute on you.

111
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,422
Is the length okay?

112
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,524
I'd like to see it as a choker.

113
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,826
It's cute as a choker.

114
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,028
Nice. It looks good as a choker.

115
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,497
Is it good?

116
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,465
-It suits you.
-Seriously? Thank you.

117
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,768
Please use it.

118
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,171
-Usak's words made an impact.
-It's so true!

119
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,773
This is a nice change.

120
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,176
So I gave you the necklace,

121
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,978
but can I ask for a favor?

122
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,279
What is it?

123
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,416
-I want to do your makeup.
-Oh, please go ahead.

124
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,019
Looking at your face
makes me want to do your makeup.

125
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,821
I want to polish you up.

126
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,956
-Let's do it.
-I'd like you to.

127
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,625
-May I?
-Please do.

128
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,260
-Then…
-Please make me beautiful.

129
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,194
I will.

130
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,800
I feel like I was clear with him today.

131
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,438
I conveyed my feelings properly. I did.

132
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,175
How I wanted to talk to him
and all that's led up to it.

133
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,643
I think I expressed myself.

134
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,447
Yes. So the rest is up to him.

135
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,282
Well,

136
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:35,021
if I get a chance to talk to him again,
I would love it.

137
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,992
This is a gift from Gensei.

138
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,561
It's so cute.

139
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,962
Yeah, it's very cute.

140
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,033
There was an accessory shop
near our selling spot.

141
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,370
I went to the shop before we opened
and gave it to him after we finished.

142
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,307
What? That's so sweet!

143
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,908
That's too lovely.

144
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,711
I like giving gifts on ordinary days.

145
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,848
If it suits the person…

146
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,517
That feeling of wanting
to give someone a gift…

147
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,686
It doesn't come every day.

148
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,188
That feeling is special.

149
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,223
Yeah, I agree.

150
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:16,095
I thought maybe it was meaningful
that he gave this to me,

151
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,466
but then he asked,
"Will you do me a favor?"

152
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,703
So maybe it was meant to be
more light-hearted.

153
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,839
To tell you the truth, I wasn't quite sure

154
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,576
how serious his feelings were for me.

155
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,848
I couldn't tell if he liked me or not.

156
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,218
-What? I see.
-His feelings didn't get across?

157
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,553
What?

158
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,190
It seemed pretty clear,
but people perceive things differently.

159
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,626
Maybe it wasn't clear enough for Ryota?

160
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,629
So he needed to clearly say, "I like you"?

161
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,763
-Maybe.
-I see.

162
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,633
But Gensei's change… evolution.

163
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,835
-He really evolved.
-Thanks to Usak.

164
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,802
A parting gift.

165
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,038
A parting gift for everyone's heart.

166
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,842
It was planted and started sprouting.
I'm impressed.

167
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,143
Amazing.

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,146
When people change,
their faces change too.

169
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,948
Yeah, that's so true.

170
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,617
-They gain resolve.
-That's really true.

171
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,720
We're talking normally,
but someone has transformed.

172
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,123
I didn't notice myself.

173
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,625
-You're beautiful.
-Thank you very much.

174
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,094
-So stylish. Gorgeous.
-This is my business look.

175
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,763
Finally, I'm back in normal mode.

176
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,935
That's amazing
how you made these so quickly.

177
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,404
Hey, Dai, come.

178
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,806
Huh?

179
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,708
He says you should come here.

180
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:45,985
Please go ahead.

181
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,086
Please go ahead.

182
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,288
Oh, hey, now…

183
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,724
-This is exactly why!
-Stop it.

184
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,327
-He's confusing Dai.
-Yeah!

185
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,463
But he can't put his hand on him.

186
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,397
What?

187
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,536
There's one thing that bothers me.

188
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,438
We're better off as friends.

189
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,308
I think that might be a better fit for us.

190
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,643
And yet,

191
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,011
despite that,

192
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,848
he keeps trying to provoke me.

193
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:25,758
I really don't get that man!

194
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,164
I'm kind of

195
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,103
getting comfortable with him.

196
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,839
Right now,

197
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,873
he's not as…

198
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,678
Since we said we'd be friends again,

199
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,615
he's no longer as clingy.

200
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,887
If things continue like this,
things might work out.

201
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,994
I feel more comfortable
when they don't come on too strong.

202
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,531
At least until we begin to date.

203
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,369
Now that there's space between them,
he's more comfortable with Dai.

204
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,673
But it doesn't necessarily mean
Dai also feels comfortable.

205
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,408
It must be hard for Dai.

206
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,411
He wants to be lovey-dovey.

207
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,779
-Like that.
-Yeah!

208
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,048
That's a bit…

209
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,783
That is not good.

210
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,117
No, not good.

211
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,652
They really suck you in.

212
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,721
-And he pushed his hand away.
-Exactly.

213
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,057
-He's so bad.
-And look at his face!

214
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,626
-No wonder his face was like this.
-Of course.

215
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,727
It's natural.

216
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,297
So it's okay for Shun to make a move,

217
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,568
but when Dai puts his hand down,
he pushes it away.

218
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,572
It's like he made the move
just so he could push him away.

219
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,709
He's clarifying his stance.

220
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,312
To clearly define his boundaries?

221
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,015
That's very confusing.

222
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,516
He's difficult.

223
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,687
PLEASE DISCUSS AND DECIDE
WHO WILL TAKE TODAY'S SHIFT

224
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,855
Raise your hand.

225
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,156
I'll do it.

226
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,326
-That was quick.
-So quick.

227
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,694
I'll go.

228
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,962
You wanna go?

229
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,263
Cool.

230
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,298
Taeheon, then.

231
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,666
Who will you choose?

232
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,167
I choose

233
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,903
Kazuto.

234
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,574
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

235
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:23,776
Then…

236
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,645
you should go.

237
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,720
-Good luck.
-Please work with me.

238
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,855
My pleasure.

239
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,491
Kazuto again. Isn't this great?

240
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,493
He's unrivaled.

241
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,862
Shunko!

242
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,568
I couldn't object.

243
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,538
-Why not?
-Well, I wanted to ask him out.

244
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,506
I understand.

245
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,842
I never imagined
Taeheon would beat me to it.

246
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,180
I wonder what his intention is.
Not that I think he has one.

247
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,020
Did you think you'd work today?

248
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,756
No, I didn't.

249
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,592
But I wanted to work with you.

250
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,761
-Really?
-I haven't yet with you.

251
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,497
I thought the same.

252
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,167
Welcome to our shop. Oh, hello.

253
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,035
Welcome.

254
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,770
-Here.
-Thank you.

255
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,006
-Thank you very much. Take care.
-Thank you.

256
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,475
Hello. Welcome to our shop.

257
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,878
We have coffee, lattes, and cookies.

258
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,851
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

259
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,291
-Hi, sorry for the wait.
-Here it comes. Thank you.

260
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,193
Thank you.

261
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,295
-Thank you.
-I can take it. Thank you.

262
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,797
-Here, thank you.
-Have a good day.

263
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,402
Do we just let these Hamburg patties stew?

264
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,171
How do you change
after you start dating someone?

265
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,573
When I date someone,

266
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,542
my life centers around them.

267
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,111
-I see.
-I always adjust to them.

268
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,314
Unconditional love, you could say.

269
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,415
Unconditional love.

270
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,820
How do you change?

271
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,589
I can go either way.

272
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,491
I want to be with someone
who gives me butterflies.

273
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,293
I totally agree.

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,229
-That's important, right?
-It's important.

275
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,099
It's important to find them attractive,

276
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,635
but also important to find them endearing.

277
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,905
Then I feel like I can forgive them.

278
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,512
Have you talked with your crush lately?

279
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,450
I've been able to talk with him a little.

280
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:50,990
It's kind of important to spend time
with everyone, but also with my crush.

281
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,192
I'm finding the balance.

282
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,929
I'm trying not to call on him too much.

283
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,901
Did you tell him how you feel?

284
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,303
Yes, I did.

285
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,708
I told him I was attracted to him.

286
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,012
Were you straightforward?

287
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,347
Yeah, I told him quite clearly.

288
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,287
-That's tough.
-What?

289
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,055
-That's tough to do.
-Me?

290
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,723
I don't know, but…

291
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,260
I must be clear in situations like this,
or they won't get it.

292
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,634
Ryota is interested in someone,

293
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,305
and I could tell he was really into them.

294
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,907
That hurt my feelings.

295
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,344
Yeah… I think so.

296
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,247
But he was wearing the necklace.

297
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,884
I'm not sure what it means for him.

298
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,455
Gensei realized that Ryota likes someone.

299
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,525
But Ryota is wearing his necklace.

300
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,896
-But these things happen, don't they?
-They do.

301
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,898
Sorry for the wait.

302
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

303
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,467
-Come again.
-Take care.

304
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,478
-There they are.
-Here they come.

305
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,512
-Yes!
-A new person?

306
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,717
So this is where they join?

307
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,505
Welcome.

308
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,539
Hello.

309
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,078
-One iced latte, please.
-An iced latte. Sure.

310
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,947
Cookies are on sale now.

311
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,048
I'll buy one, then.

312
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,517
-Really? Thank you. It's 600 yen.
-Okay.

313
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,388
Thank you.

314
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,028
Here's your change.

315
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,897
Should I wait here for the coffee?

316
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,099
-We'll bring it to you.
-Thank you.

317
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,067
Thank you.

318
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,610
Maybe he's a new cast member?

319
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,112
-Is that what's happening?
-I don't know.

320
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,647
Is that why he has a suitcase?

321
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,315
Should we go together?

322
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,520
-Thank you.
-Excuse us.

323
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,155
Thank you for waiting.

324
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,723
Your iced latte.

325
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,324
Actually…

326
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,763
I'm Ikuo. I'll be living
with you guys starting today.

327
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,831
Wow.

328
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,933
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

329
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,968
My hunch was right.

330
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,272
-I'm glad to meet you.
-Wow, glad to meet you too.

331
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,644
I wonder how their day went.

332
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,711
I'm curious.

333
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,118
-Look, they're back.
-We're back.

334
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,821
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

335
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,222
-Welcome back.
-Home we are.

336
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,990
-That was your outfit, Taeheon?
-Cute.

337
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,293
You look different. So cute.

338
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,395
-Great. You look wonderful.
-So sleek.

339
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,000
We have an important announcement.

340
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,068
-No, don't.
-What?

341
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,570
-Don't.
-What?

342
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,205
What?

343
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,612
Good evening. I'm Ikuo.
I'll be joining you as of today.

344
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,780
Nice to meet you.

345
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,648
That's hilarious.

346
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,549
What a surprise.

347
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,285
-A refreshing type.
-Ikuo.

348
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,754
He's different from the others.

349
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,990
-Do you know him?
-No, I don't.

350
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,160
You were talking as if you knew him.

351
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,762
I just thought the timing was hilarious.

352
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,030
Glad to meet you.

353
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,632
We're happy to have you.

354
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,567
I'm Ikuo.

355
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
I'm 22.

356
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,871
I work at a burger shop.

357
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,440
I love getting butterflies.

358
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,409
I want to sleep together,
take baths together…

359
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,946
I like to enjoy the simple things.

360
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,316
I'm the kind of person
who wants to take care of them.

361
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,018
I'd even wash their hair.

362
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,355
I'd like to play
with the bubbles in their hair.

363
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,458
I don't want to be passive in love.

364
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,727
Do you mind if I fall in love?

365
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm sorry I poked my nose into this.

366
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,966
I'll show you such loving care,
no matter what.

367
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,568
Did you see the previews?

368
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,569
He's assertive.

369
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,373
You know this has got to be good.

370
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,842
Why did you decide to participate?

371
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,111
I wanted a boyfriend.

372
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,114
Quite simply.

373
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,183
I haven't had one for a year and a half.

374
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,253
I'm hoping this will give me
the opportunity to find someone nice.

375
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,625
What kind of person is your type?

376
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,528
Someone on the same wavelength.

377
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,263
I know what you mean.

378
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,832
Shun says, "I know what you mean."

379
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,935
In a soft whisper.

380
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,002
And…

381
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,371
Well,

382
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,310
I like to be spoiled.

383
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,379
I like feeling cherished.

384
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,583
What?

385
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,552
No one's reacting!

386
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,788
-I wanted something.
-We needed more of a response.

387
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,526
I'm happy to have another cast member.

388
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,761
He's good-looking, isn't he?

389
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,498
He smiles a lot. Seems friendly.

390
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,467
He's a positive person.

391
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,436
He seems mentally strong.

392
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,211
-Yeah, this shirt might be good.
-Huh?

393
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,479
This shirt might work.

394
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,447
Looks good.

395
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,753
It's cute.

396
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,721
Do you like it?

397
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,989
Hey, Ryota.

398
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,056
Yes?

399
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,925
If I ask for the usual…

400
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,994
Oh, a café mocha? I'll make one for you.

401
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,528
Would you?

402
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,197
Yes, of course.

403
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,434
-Here.
-That's the most beautiful one yet.

404
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,435
Thank you.

405
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,742
The café mocha is an important factor
that connects them.

406
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,909
That's true.

407
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,978
I'll be there soon.

408
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,849
What about Ikuo?

409
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,450
What if he likes you, Gensei?

410
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,819
That won't happen.

411
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,689
It's unlikely.

412
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,590
Why?

413
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,924
They're 12 years apart.

414
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,360
Does that even matter?

415
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,098
What if he likes Kazuto?

416
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,833
Well…

417
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,638
But I feel like those two
aren't compatible.

418
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,840
Kazuto and Ikuo.

419
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,275
I agree.

420
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,610
Different personalities.

421
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,246
I don't know.

422
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
I can't picture them together.

423
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,116
-That's important.
-Yeah.

424
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,152
Yeah, that's very important.

425
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,623
Shall we ask him who he likes best
based on first impressions?

426
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,858
-I think he'd tell us.
-Yeah, he would.

427
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,994
He'd say it with confidence.

428
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,629
"I like Shun."

429
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,334
What if he says it's Dai?

430
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,270
You're saying it'll be a battle
between me and him?

431
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,105
-Right.
-Yeah.

432
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,740
You're right.

433
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,277
It could be anyone.

434
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,645
It could be any one of us.

435
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,083
It could be a battle.

436
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,786
-"A battle."
-"A battle."

437
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,023
-Ikuo has arrived.
-Yes, he has.

438
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,859
-Yes, welcome.
-A new cast member.

439
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,894
He likes to be pampered, but he's bold.

440
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,264
He's a new type. We have the young guy,

441
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,301
but no one who'd boldly say,
"I like to be spoiled."

442
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,469
You're right.

443
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,871
Who do you think he likes?
Well, we don't know yet.

444
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,872
Ikuo? Who…

445
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,341
-He said someone in tune with him.
-Yeah.

446
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,442
-Alan?
-Alan?

447
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,578
I thought it might be Alan too.

448
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,313
-Someone mature.
-Right.

449
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,115
I think Ikuo will go for Dai.

450
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,850
What? You think so?

451
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,951
Why?

452
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,421
They're on the same wavelength.
They're both excitable.

453
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,323
-They're both extroverted.
-I see.

454
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,925
Dai is the young guy,

455
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,394
but he loves being clingy.

456
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,030
I feel like he'd totally welcome
someone being needy.

457
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,333
Upcoming turmoil?

458
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,002
It smells good.

459
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,437
Oh wow!

460
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,039
It's my favorite dish!

461
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,775
It looks delicious!

462
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,942
So good!

463
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,744
Is the potato hard?

464
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,448
It's good.

465
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,349
It's okay?

466
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,251
The picnic will be special today.

467
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,886
It's gonna be so special.

468
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,521
Making rice balls?

469
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,855
-Let's do it together.
-Sure.

470
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,224
We're leaving.

471
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,760
-Shun is worried.
-Yeah, he looks a bit concerned.

472
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,498
-We're the same age, right?
-Yeah.

473
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,967
You've been single a year and a half?

474
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,235
Yes, I have.

475
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,370
How about you?

476
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,471
Two years. Exactly two.

477
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,539
We're about the same.

478
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,740
Exactly two years.

479
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,408
It makes you want one.

480
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,643
Yeah.

481
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,347
Hey, have you ever made this
for a boyfriend?

482
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,149
No, I don't think I have.

483
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,053
But it'd be so nice.

484
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,456
Please put rice on top.

485
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,125
Wait.

486
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:21,993
Go!

487
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,929
I'm not a dog.

488
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,863
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,531
Plastic wrap, please--

490
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,999
No need to get so mad!

491
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,167
-I know.
-That's right.

492
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,571
I've already had fun today.

493
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,240
-The picnic hasn't even started.
-You're not going?

494
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,445
When was the last time
you went on a picnic?

495
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,481
Three or four years ago.

496
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,648
For real?

497
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,684
Whoa, that's a lighthouse, right?

498
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,219
Yeah, I wanna go up there.

499
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,320
It's beautiful.

500
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,888
Can you go inside it?

501
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:50,956
I'm sure you can.

502
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,625
Here we go.

503
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,193
Thank you for the food.

504
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,896
I'm gonna eat the fruit first.

505
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,132
Delicious.

506
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,502
This is delicious.

507
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,904
Kazuto, this is really good.

508
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,639
-Yeah. You're a genius.
-Good?

509
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,640
Yes, genius.

510
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,375
-Thanks for the food.
-So good.

511
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,544
-Do you like the potato salad?
-It's delicious.

512
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,579
It has crab meat in it. It's so posh.

513
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,515
It's so good. Everyone should try it.

514
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,116
-I'm gonna try some.
-Yeah.

515
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,420
-Has anyone caught your interest?
-Yes.

516
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:28,193
I'd like to get to know him more
and talk to him more.

517
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,166
Oh, great.

518
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,101
Hit it back.

519
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,504
It's peaceful.

520
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,772
-Nice.
-Too peaceful.

521
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,508
It's hot.

522
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,744
-Let's find shade.
-Break time.

523
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,746
-Let's take a break.
-Volleyball time!

524
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,147
You're a tough coach.

525
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,248
Let's play, then.

526
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,922
-He's good.
-Yeah, he is.

527
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,323
Did he used to play?

528
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,158
He's the type who can do anything.

529
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,494
He's athletic.

530
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,362
-I find that…
-Yeah.

531
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,931
…endearing.

532
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,570
You know what?

533
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,904
Yeah, what do you think?

534
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,807
I like this Mr. Ikuo.

535
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,747
But it could just be that he's new,
so it's refreshing.

536
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,085
Remember when you were making
sandwiches and rice balls today?

537
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,721
Ikuo was mostly next to you.

538
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,656
I think he likes you.

539
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,658
I can't say I disagree.

540
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,295
I like his vibe.

541
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,464
Well…

542
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,633
He's straightforward.

543
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,801
-What?
-Dai?

544
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,969
-Dai, dear?
-Oh, Dai.

545
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,937
Are you moving on to the next guy?

546
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,007
-Ikuo is totally different from Shun.
-That's right.

547
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,142
Wanna go take a pic up there?

548
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,310
-Huh?
-The rock.

549
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,545
I want to.

550
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,080
-Let's go take photos.
-Sure.

551
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,749
Over by the rock? Or this way?

552
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,151
-Which one?
-Maybe this way first.

553
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,453
Yeah, sounds good.

554
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,288
Hey, I'm back.

555
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,362
Did you have fun watching us?

556
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,864
Thank you.

557
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,999
Here you go, Ryota.

558
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,100
Thank you.

559
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,536
-It's cute.
-Nice, right?

560
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,205
Did I gain "cute" points?

561
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,706
-One?
-One.

562
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,642
Is this the birth of a new couple?

563
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,517
Should we go to the lighthouse?

564
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,086
Tell us what you wanna do.

565
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,055
I want to talk with Kazuto.

566
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,625
Ever since our date at the inn,

567
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,228
I have been unsure about how Kazuto felt.

568
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,464
I've been moving forward
without knowing how he feels.

569
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,402
That's been unsettling for me.

570
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,771
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

571
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,339
Where are we going?

572
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,507
To the lighthouse.

573
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,054
Their feelings are intertwined.

574
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,930
I don't think Dai likes
what's happening over there.

575
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,699
It must be worrisome for you.

576
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,234
I'm not worried or anything.

577
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,337
I'm not worried at all.

578
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,274
I don't think Dai would choose him.

579
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,544
I think he'll choose me,

580
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,746
but you know…

581
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,283
that's…

582
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,287
If I were you, I wouldn't like it.

583
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,254
Yeah, right?

584
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,830
How was the coffee truck
with Taeheon yesterday?

585
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,032
It was fun.

586
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,300
Did you enjoy it?

587
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,403
I see. I was really worried about it,
to tell you the truth,

588
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,674
when Taeheon raised his hand
and said he wanted to work with you.

589
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,013
I realized I want to know how you feel.

590
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,083
So I really wanted this time with you.

591
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:13,852
I see.

592
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,492
Compared to how I felt
before the overnight date,

593
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,694
after the date,

594
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,931
I was genuinely interested in you
before the date.

595
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,167
That's why

596
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,404
I wanted to go with you then,
so I wrote your name.

597
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,614
Now you're more like a friend to me.

598
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,784
That's how I feel now.

599
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,987
What a shock…

600
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,156
But he told him clearly.

601
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,357
-That's important.
-Yeah.

602
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,925
That makes you wanna cry.

603
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,899
Don't you wanna catch crabs?

604
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,600
Wow, I want crabs!

605
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,635
Can you come here?

606
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,271
-Seriously? I'm really gonna come.
-Yeah, come here.

607
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,306
All right.

608
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,076
-Will the crabs pinch?
-See? Look.

609
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,013
Can crabs live underwater?

610
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,681
-There are so many!
-It's crazy.

611
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,287
Hey, be careful. You'll get wet.

612
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,289
Without a doubt.

613
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,058
Come to think of it,

614
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,595
I'm not very assertive.

615
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,564
So it's likely…

616
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,269
that a person like Ikuo
is a better match for Dai.

617
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,506
I don't know.

618
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,210
What was your ex like?

619
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,645
Out of all of us here,

620
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,248
you're the most similar.

621
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,584
I'm similar?

622
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,818
Your vibe.

623
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,354
He was tall too.

624
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,057
Your face is similar too.

625
00:30:59,123 --> 00:30:59,958
For real?

626
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,628
What was your last relationship like?

627
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,430
I was with someone way older.

628
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,365
That one spoiled me a lot.

629
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,870
-Your ex was sweet on you?
-Super sweet.

630
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,171
Ask me how sweet.

631
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,606
How sweet?

632
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,442
-Like frosting on a strawberry shortcake--
-Annoying!

633
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,277
Hey, let me finish my joke!

634
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,914
-I felt like it was gonna be long.
-Don't say that.

635
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,582
-So I stopped you.
-Yeah?

636
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,618
We're so in sync, aren't we?

637
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,053
-Yeah, I think so.
-Isn't it insane? We're so alike.

638
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,323
-It's insane.
-I love being in tune with someone.

639
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,094
No matter how much I entertain someone,

640
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,796
if I get lackluster responses,

641
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,431
it's a turnoff.

642
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,533
Yeah.

643
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,239
I wonder what Dai thinks.

644
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,876
Just because they hit it off
doesn't mean it's love.

645
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,045
Yes, it's a tough one.

646
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,447
-They could be BFFs.
-Right.

647
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,683
-Having fun is not enough.
-Right.

648
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,053
Actually, Dai has already fallen for Shun
with his darker personality.

649
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,788
Though they're totally different.

650
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,356
Watch the gravel.

651
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,257
Yeah.

652
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,763
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

653
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,965
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

654
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,500
-That must've hurt.
-It did.

655
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,468
Let's head to the grass.

656
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,503
It must hurt.

657
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,570
It really hurts.

658
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,974
-Is it really painful?
-It's really painful.

659
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,643
Did you hurt your ankle?
Hey, wait. Take it easy.

660
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,544
It hurts.

661
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:28,746
Are you okay?

662
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,481
Yeah, I'm fine. It isn't bleeding.

663
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,083
Are you okay? Does it still hurt?

664
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,885
It's probably fine.

665
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,786
Are you sure?

666
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,021
-Okay.
-Can you walk?

667
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,756
It must hurt.

668
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,192
Oh, it hurts.

669
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,761
Can I give you a piggyback ride?
Should be easy.

670
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,929
Hold my bottle.

671
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,700
Yeah, I got this.

672
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,002
Wait a minute.

673
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,304
You're going that way?

674
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,039
Wait, which way, then?

675
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:55,974
That way.

676
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,744
Aw, Dad!

677
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,678
Knock it off.

678
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm not your dad.

679
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,483
This part is steep.

680
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,617
I'm fine.

681
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,386
-To the observatory?
-Is it too hard?

682
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,388
No problem. Let's go.

683
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,257
Wow. It's so beautiful.

684
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,627
Thank you for today.

685
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,463
That's my line.

686
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,935
You clearly told me, "No, we're friends."

687
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,604
That was important for me.

688
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,975
I didn't know how you felt about me,

689
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:36,347
but my feelings
took on a life of their own.

690
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:44,122
Now I feel like I'll be able
to enjoy my time with you more naturally.

691
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,994
So I feel grateful that you chose
to be honest and say how you feel.

692
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,699
Wow, he's so positive. It's impressive.

693
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,067
He's quite mature.

694
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,536
He articulates his feelings
with consideration.

695
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,772
-What about you, Ryo?
-Huh?

696
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,940
Don't you want to talk to someone?

697
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,108
I do, but

698
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,943
I can't go.

699
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,879
Three of us there would be awkward.

700
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,013
I see.

701
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,582
I won't be able to say what I want to say.

702
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,885
I'll find another opportunity.

703
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,120
I want to talk to Kazuto.

704
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm interested in Kazuto.

705
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,729
Oh, poor Gensei…

706
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,763
Gensei.

707
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,698
-That must be hard.
-Painful.

708
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,668
Maybe tomorrow or the day after.

709
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,969
Or today, right?

710
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:32,870
Yeah.

711
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,006
Welcome back.

712
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,675
I'm back. I'm having a banana.

713
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,643
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

714
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,578
Do you guys want a drink?

715
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,281
-We had some water.
-Did you?

716
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,882
-He looked.
-He glanced at him.

717
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,917
He wanted to check.

718
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,686
Things are complicated.

719
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,123
I'm gonna drink some water.

720
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,808
Are you okay, Shun?

721
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,577
I'm annoyed by him.

722
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,012
-Annoyed?
-Yeah.

723
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,014
I don't even want to hear his voice.

724
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,784
I'm having an adverse reaction to him.

725
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,896
Wait. Run around once more.

726
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,505
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't be able to handle this.

727
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,007
That's what Gensei's thinking.

728
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,075
Right.

729
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,411
I wonder what the heck this is.

730
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,181
It's not jealousy or anything.

731
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,590
What kind of picnic is this?
This is a first.

732
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,374
What a turbulent picnic.

733
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,009
Truly!

734
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,343
Only Ikuo enjoyed it.

735
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,412
Ikuo knows nothing!

736
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,181
Ikuo is innocent!
