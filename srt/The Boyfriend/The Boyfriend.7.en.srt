1
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,544
That looks so delicious.

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,013
-Did you make it?
-Yup.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,180
-Looks good!
-Cool.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,548
Thank you!

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,551
-You should blow on it.
-Thanks.

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:19,953
Kazuto, look this way for one sec.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,688
Kazuto, look this way.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,157
Wow.

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,693
-You made this by yourself?
-Yes.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,062
No one helped with the seasoning?

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,630
-I seasoned it myself.
-Amazing.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,865
Hey, the chopsticks…

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,766
So delicious.

14
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,970
The chopstick rests?

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,938
Nikujaga.

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,574
Hey, this soup. What is it for?

17
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,842
That's tonjiru pork soup.

18
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,079
But today's main dishes are
meat and potato stew and sashimi.

19
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,048
The tonjiru is…

20
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,051
Did Ikuo make this nikujaga?

21
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,419
-Yep.
-It's so tasty.

22
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,059
ARTIST

23
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,495
Did you guys have a fun picnic?

24
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,897
-I had a good time.
-Yeah?

25
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,031
Did you have fun?

26
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,703
How about you?

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,638
Yep.

28
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:25,885
Thank you.

29
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,120
That's called "lazy."

30
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,688
-This is called "lazy"?
-Yeah.

31
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,723
Thank you. This is called "being kind."

32
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,092
Thank you.

33
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,361
-How awkward.
-So many emotions.

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,363
-It's awkward.
-It was like being in hell.

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,565
This is bad.

36
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,502
Let's put the bento lunch leftovers
in the fridge.

37
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,870
I'll wash the bento box.

38
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,373
You get soaked doing this.

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,845
JAPANESE FOOD CHEF

40
00:02:58,912 --> 00:02:59,913
Oh, this is…

41
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,753
Yum.

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,991
Can we talk?

43
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,026
Why?

44
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,993
I want to talk.

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,894
Okay.

46
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,763
What is it?

47
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,872
I really feel like I left you alone today.

48
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,615
-I don't think you really do.
-I do.

49
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,651
In the end, you're just talk.

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,553
What do you mean?

51
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,023
You said you left me alone there…

52
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,964
but your words and actions don't match.

53
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,866
It made me think

54
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,203
that you were a person

55
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,406
who doesn't walk the walk.

56
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,774
Yeah.

57
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,878
So I feel like I'm done.

58
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,252
There's something I want to say.

59
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,186
No.

60
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,858
You can say…

61
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,595
whatever you want.

62
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,165
So make me understand

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,535
some other way.

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,004
That's it.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,383
It was good to talk to him.

66
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,419
Well,

67
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:53,693
I think Shun finally started to want me.

68
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,829
It's no time to be celebrating,

69
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:02,001
and there were definitely
many things I liked about Ikuo.

70
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,836
But in the end,

71
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,973
after everything that happened,

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,476
seeing Shun feeling a little lonely,

73
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:15,648
or seeing him out of sorts,
unable to express his feelings…

74
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,552
I can't help but think, "Aw, cute."

75
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,087
I mean, I'm attracted to him.

76
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,956
I think he's good-looking and cute,
and I like him.

77
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,226
I like--
I think I've fallen for him already.

78
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,798
He finds him endearing.

79
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:36,969
Dai now seems so mature.
His views of Shun are so understanding.

80
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,372
In fact, he's happy
he has Shun's attention.

81
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,607
He can't leave him alone anymore, can he?

82
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,845
You're going to drink one now?

83
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,747
I'm making this for Kazuto.

84
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,415
What?

85
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,887
A café mocha?

86
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,788
Yeah.

87
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,560
I thought that was a Gensei exclusive.

88
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,829
Oh, that's painful!

89
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,763
That hurts.

90
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,770
I don't know what to say…

91
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:15,375
Well, it was the first time
I fully understood Ryota's feelings.

92
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,945
I felt that he cared for Kazuto very much.

93
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,314
I can't really see a future.

94
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,319
I think maybe my role here is done.

95
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,354
I feel like I've done all I can.

96
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,658
The special café mocha…

97
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,194
It was exclusive to Gensei…

98
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,696
How heartbreaking.

99
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,765
What will Gensei do?

100
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,800
I want him to do Ryota's makeup.

101
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,769
Yeah, he hasn't done that yet, right?

102
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,004
I really want him to do that.

103
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,775
As he does his makeup
and stands behind him to do his hair,

104
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,077
a tear falls,

105
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,212
but Ryota doesn't notice
since Gensei is behind him.

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,515
You already see it happening?

107
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,920
-It dinged.
-There it is.

108
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,490
-"The coffee truck will be closed today."
-Okay.

109
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,359
Now what?

110
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,729
"You will now head to a racetrack

111
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,697
for a go-kart contest."

112
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,832
Craziness!

113
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,103
-Sounds fun.
-Awesome!

114
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,907
"The winner will be able
to ask one person…"

115
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,642
What?

116
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,578
"…to fulfill their wish."

117
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:26,946
A wish?

118
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,081
That's interesting.

119
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,786
-Did you hear that?
-What?

120
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,421
The wish is important.

121
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,292
I'm not looking for a date
with anyone else besides Shun.

122
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,028
So, Shun.

123
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,731
I want to talk to Ryota.

124
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:53,206
I'll tell Kazuto
I want to go on a date with him.

125
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,045
Well, the person I thought of was Kazuto.

126
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,181
Rather than doing something with him,

127
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,517
I just want to know why I thought of him.

128
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,857
I want to try again with Kazuto,
just the two of us.

129
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,291
The coffee truck is fine too.

130
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,428
I want to do something
with just the two of us.

131
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,098
What's Kazuto thinking?

132
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
I don't know what to wish.

133
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:31,310
Maybe make breakfast with Ryota.

134
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,545
But I don't know.

135
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,085
I want more alone time with him,

136
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,686
and I want to go on a date.

137
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,857
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:47,960
I don't know.

139
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,368
-This is insane.
-Wow! That looks fun!

140
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,669
I want to do it too!

141
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,604
-It's a proper circuit.
-I want to go.

142
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,306
Look at our names on that screen.

143
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,608
The top two will be in the finals, right?

144
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,611
Kazuto, third place means nothing.

145
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,780
Go for it!

146
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,428
-Did it start?
-It did.

147
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,430
It started! Taeheon!

148
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,366
Taeheon is so fast!

149
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,135
-Good start.
-Good start, Taeheon!

150
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,469
Looks so fun!

151
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,740
THIRD: KAZUTO

152
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:35,641
This is crazy!

153
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,978
-Isn't Ikuo good?
-Ikuo is good.

154
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,146
So fast!

155
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,414
He's kind of cool.

156
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,715
FIRST: IKUO

157
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,883
What the heck?

158
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,985
-So fast.
-Incredible.

159
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,120
-Shun is second.
-Here he comes!

160
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,822
It's Shun.

161
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,624
-Let's go, Shun!
-Go!

162
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,959
Pass Ikuo.

163
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,527
FIRST: IKUO

164
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,599
He's good at everything.

165
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,633
It's fun to watch.

166
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,567
SECOND: SHUN

167
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,768
Here comes Shun!

168
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,237
-Yeah, Shun!
-Yeah!

169
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,176
You guys were cool!

170
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,712
Who do you think will win?

171
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,213
My bet is on Mr. Alan.

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
No, I think Dai.

173
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,116
I bet Gensei.

174
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,158
My legs don't reach.

175
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,493
His legs won't reach.

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,662
How cute!

177
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,064
Good luck.

178
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,433
-Alan.
-Alan is slow.

179
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,468
Hang in there!

180
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,206
He fell way behind.

181
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,641
Is the brake on?

182
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,110
Wait, he passed him!

183
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,211
It's Dai.

184
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,946
FIRST: DAI

185
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,915
THIRD: GENSEI

186
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,117
It's Ryota.

187
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,053
Ryota!

188
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,723
-A tight race!
-Hey!

189
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,691
Great.

190
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,593
Dai's angry. He got angry.

191
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,028
Be careful.

192
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,663
This is a great race.

193
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,237
He's going for it.

194
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,705
He's not giving up.

195
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,540
Ryota's unusually aggressive.

196
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,208
-Yeah.
-Incredible.

197
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,143
FIRST: RYOTA

198
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,177
He came from behind.

199
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,246
SECOND: DAI

200
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,016
Why did you pass me?

201
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,918
-Who's first?
-I wanted to win.

202
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,720
-What's your wish?
-I want to know.

203
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,522
-Me too.
-I want to go on a date.

204
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,657
I want to go on a date too.

205
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,492
Of course I wanna go on a date.

206
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,295
-Shun.
-Why won't he take off the helmet?

207
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,997
-Good luck!
-Why?

208
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,865
He's so comical.

209
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,102
Let's go, Ikuo!

210
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,946
Wow, here we go!

211
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,983
What happened to Shun?

212
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,218
Hang in there.

213
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,519
Shun, go for it!

214
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,587
Unlock the brake.

215
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,655
Hey, go for it.

216
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,590
Is Ikuo in the lead?

217
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,658
-That's Ikuo.
-Ikuo.

218
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,127
Ikuo is unrivaled.

219
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,399
-Ikuo spun out.
-Ikuo.

220
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,301
-He was too aggressive.
-Go!

221
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,471
All at once!

222
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,705
-Dai is first.
-It's Dai.

223
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,373
-Dai.
-Dai's in first now.

224
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,374
Hang in there, Ikuo.

225
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,543
-Ikuo is in second?
-It's Shun.

226
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,312
-Shun!
-Shun is amazing!

227
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,247
Shun is cool.

228
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,849
-What happened?
-Shun and Dai!

229
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,883
Dai and Shun.

230
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,586
Wow, amazing!

231
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,955
-What? Shun?
-Shun is the biggest surprise!

232
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,490
He woke up.

233
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,792
-It's only the first lap.
-What? Crazy.

234
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,394
Insane!

235
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,196
It's Shun.

236
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,431
Shun is good.

237
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:52,037
FIRST: SHUN

238
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,706
WINNER: SHUN

239
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,107
That's it. He won.

240
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,110
-You're too fast, Shun.
-Shun, you're great!

241
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,347
Shun showed his determination.

242
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,581
-That's right.
-Yeah.

243
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,950
He wanted to win. He wants his wish.

244
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,318
What do you want to do?

245
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,219
Yeah.

246
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,821
Look at his arrogant face!

247
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,189
He looks pretty pleased.

248
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,191
Wow, that was one minute and ten seconds.

249
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,592
Unexpected.

250
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,994
-Good job.
-Great.

251
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,629
So tell us.

252
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,863
Tell us.

253
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,565
-Say what?
-Your wish.

254
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,766
Wait a minute.

255
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,134
My wish?

256
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
What?

257
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,713
None.

258
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,422
You don't have a wish?

259
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,898
What? Wait.

260
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,033
He's funny.

261
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,501
Shenron has appeared.

262
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,469
But you have no wish?

263
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,774
-I guess Shun is interesting.
-He's funny.

264
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,143
I guess that's part of his charm.

265
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,078
-That's his charm.
-Yeah.

266
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,848
I'm kind of envious that he can say that.

267
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,815
That's true.

268
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,852
People tend to try
to come up with something.

269
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,587
Even when we don't have a wish.

270
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:15,855
I'm sure Dai understands.

271
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:20,292
Right, like,
"Yes, you're being your usual self."

272
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,195
We just watched them have fun
in the go-kart race, that's all.

273
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,297
-Right.
-Exactly.

274
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,132
Thanks for the food.

275
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,200
Thanks for the food.

276
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,134
Delish.

277
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,606
I'm so happy.

278
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,542
Hey, Ikuo.

279
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,912
What was your impression
of the person you're interested in?

280
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,480
-The first impression?
-Yeah.

281
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,482
My impression is…

282
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,687
Well, I haven't had the chance
to gauge any feelings yet.

283
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:54,059
I do want to find out more
through future conversations.

284
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,230
I don't want… to be passive in love.

285
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,101
Happiness won't come if you just wait.

286
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,438
I can't be in a relationship with someone
unless there are feelings there.

287
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,041
So, I wondered,

288
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
why not just make them fall for me?

289
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,847
The other person.

290
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,084
I think it's good to keep trying

291
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,821
until the person becomes interested.

292
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,661
Everyone's bound to project
their own romances onto what he said.

293
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,362
Yeah, gets you thinking.

294
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
I'm getting heated.

295
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,838
It's urgent. I want the two of us to talk.

296
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,907
Who said that to whom?

297
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,042
Whose voice was that?

298
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,971
Ikuocchi.

299
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,774
Whoa, Kazuto is remarkable!

300
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,410
-Kazuto is incredible!
-Amazing!

301
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,779
-How many is this now? Four? Five?
-Five?

302
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,847
He got five!

303
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,615
-Including Usak.
-Yes.

304
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,653
I feel like I want to spend
a little more alone time with him,

305
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,024
so I want to go on a date with Kazuto.

306
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,332
Well, I wanted to have
a proper conversation.

307
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,637
Ever since I met you at the coffee truck,

308
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,674
I've been very attracted to you.

309
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,842
Is that so?

310
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,810
Yes, secretly.

311
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,683
Then yesterday, remember when
we were alone in the kitchen for a moment?

312
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,819
I was panicking inside.

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,154
Panicking?

314
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,756
My heart was racing.

315
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,661
I really think it was love at first sight.

316
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,264
I see.

317
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,675
Can I just…

318
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,779
follow my heart?

319
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,048
Kazuto…

320
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,721
do you mind if I fall in love?

321
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,278
That's a question, right?

322
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:10,222
I think you've just seen
the superficial parts of me,

323
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,726
and you feel you want to get to know me.

324
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,896
If we spend more time together,

325
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,101
and you still think you like me,
I'd be very happy.

326
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:28,273
But I don't know you at all yet.

327
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,678
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't really trying.

328
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,650
I just thought, "Oh, a young guy
with a lot of energy is here."

329
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,123
I actually didn't think
I'd really get along with you.

330
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,728
But… talking with you like this

331
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,364
makes me think I should get to know you.

332
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,733
Thank you.

333
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,908
What a surprise.

334
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,382
I confessed my feelings.

335
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:16,822
I felt that it opened the door
for him to get to know me.

336
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,992
I hope it'll lead to the next step.

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,898
I'm surprised and, of course, flattered.

338
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,838
To fall in love
based solely on superficial qualities is…

339
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,741
I'm like, "What do you know about me?"

340
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,077
"I don't know you either."
I can't help but think that.

341
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,413
Yeah.

342
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,984
You can't judge a person after only
meeting them for two or three days.

343
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,990
"Do you mind if I fall in love with you?"
Isn't that a tough question?

344
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,792
I wouldn't know how to respond.

345
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,763
Saying, "I'm sorry, but I have
a crush on you," would be better.

346
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,264
It's an unfair question.

347
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,766
-Yeah, I agree.
-Right.

348
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,100
It's hard, right?

349
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,003
-You're passing on the responsibility.
-Right.

350
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,373
It's hard to believe it's the same guy
running around with a cloth.

351
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,776
He's a totally different person.

352
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,177
You're so right.

353
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,115
This blue will look good.

354
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,051
Try it on.

355
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,355
Looks great! Don't you think?

356
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,824
-Yeah.
-The reaction…

357
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,858
Cute.

358
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,826
You look great.

359
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,395
You don't often wear colorful clothes.

360
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,397
-Wear it.
-You should wear it.

361
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,765
-Looks great.
-Thank you.

362
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,167
Ryota has work today.

363
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,535
He went to work.

364
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,137
He has a makeup shoot.

365
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,172
-I see.
-Yeah.

366
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,708
-Wow. That's right. He's a model.
-Yeah.

367
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,376
You're wearing eye makeup today.

368
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,712
Wow, great observation!

369
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,981
Impressive! That's why you're a pro!

370
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,649
Tell me the product number later.

371
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,650
Sure.

372
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,619
He's not asking you! Not you!

373
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,589
It dinged.

374
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,591
"Today's shift will be announced."

375
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,126
There's a shift today?

376
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,630
"Ikuo will take the shift today."

377
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,199
My turn. Yes.

378
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
"Please indicate
if you'd like to work with Ikuo."

379
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,138
Raise our hands?

380
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,743
"If there are several candidates,
Ikuo can choose up to two."

381
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,944
Huh? Two?

382
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,346
-Two.
-So three of us can work?

383
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,415
Ready?

384
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,251
Who wants to work with me today?

385
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
We've never had three before.

386
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,539
Yeah, the first time ever.

387
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,975
-A three-person shift.
-Yeah. It's the first time.

388
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,712
It'll definitely be fun.

389
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,740
"Up to two" means
you don't have to pick two.

390
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,657
That's all.

391
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,296
-He chose you, Kazuto.
-I've been chosen.

392
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,631
Another day without you.

393
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,945
Is cooking your favorite household chore?

394
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,980
I guess so.

395
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,584
-I don't want to cook if it's just for me.
-Yes.

396
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,887
If it's for others, I don't mind at all.

397
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,656
I mean, I want to do it for other people

398
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,925
because I don't like doing it myself.

399
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,128
How about you?

400
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,629
-Me?
-Yeah.

401
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,731
I like taking care of people.

402
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,602
I'd do the laundry and other chores.

403
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,238
I would have meals ready.

404
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,806
You're sweet.

405
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,741
You're quite the devoted partner.

406
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,810
I tend to devote myself.

407
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,179
Maybe we're a little alike.

408
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,519
Hi. Would you like some delicious coffee?

409
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,387
This is good.

410
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,656
Is it good? Thank you very much.

411
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,957
We also have guava juice.

412
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,692
Do you want to try a little?

413
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,727
Should we try it?

414
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,163
He's cute.

415
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,597
Thank you.

416
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,865
Is he around two?

417
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,033
A year and one month.

418
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,635
A year and a month? Too cute.

419
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,770
-Come here.
-His name is Kento.

420
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,205
-Kento.
-So cute.

421
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,973
He's so friendly.

422
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,508
He likes good-looking guys.

423
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,581
Kazuto works at the coffee truck a lot.

424
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,482
Yeah.

425
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,684
Why didn't you raise your hand?

426
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,585
Me?

427
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,421
I felt it wasn't right to work with him.

428
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,924
Why?

429
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,459
I really just thought

430
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,762
today was not the day for Mr. Ikuo.

431
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,467
You're just talk.

432
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,768
Make me understand

433
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,204
some other way.

434
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,047
-The corners of his mouth are turning up.
-He's happy.

435
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,049
What the heck?

436
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,117
What's with these two?

437
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,285
I don't know.

438
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,188
Alan, what made you raise your hand?

439
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,122
-Me?
-Yeah.

440
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,124
I raised it because Kazuto did.

441
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,061
That was why?

442
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,229
You wanted to go too?

443
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,133
So what's going on with you and Kazuto?

444
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,104
I'm simply being true to myself.

445
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,875
I haven't worked with him at the truck,
and I really want to talk with him.

446
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,843
He's a very nice guy.

447
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,379
He's kind to everyone.
I like that kind of person.

448
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:16,948
Hello.

449
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,184
Okay, let's finish up.

450
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,652
Okay.

451
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,821
Let's finish up.

452
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,524
We're closed.

453
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,330
Read it to me.

454
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,499
-Just read it?
-Read it out loud.

455
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,101
-Read it out loud?
-Yes.

456
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,403
"Dear Ikuo."

457
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,304
Yes.

458
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,573
It's like a letter.

459
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,877
"I had the impression
that you were always hyper,

460
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,181
but you were calm today,
and my perception of you has changed."

461
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,184
"It was fun talking and working with you."

462
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,053
"Let's work together again."

463
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,521
"From Kazuto."

464
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,763
How was your first time
working at the coffee truck today?

465
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,633
It meant I saw the cool side of you.

466
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,337
It was different when
we were all together, just having fun.

467
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,738
When we're working,

468
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,442
we reveal our true nature,
especially when we're busy.

469
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,376
Yeah, exactly.

470
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,679
Like how well we can support others

471
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,914
or how considerate we can be.

472
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,951
That stuff becomes important.

473
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,921
I felt supported by you today.

474
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,191
I wasn't supporting you at all.

475
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:34,726
Seriously?

476
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,829
What?

477
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:42,233
That's pretty.
Like a slow version of a shooting star.

478
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,702
A show version?

479
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,842
How about this?

480
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,446
-I can give you a head massage.
-Massage me.

481
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,415
Dai's head massage?

482
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,685
Too soft.

483
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,787
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

484
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:06,958
That feels good.

485
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:07,892
Right?

486
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,730
He told me to walk the walk.

487
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,300
I'm using physical contact
to show that I want him.

488
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,738
If that happens more often, he'll realize.

489
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:24,009
I'm trying to bring our relationship back
to the way it was before.

490
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,612
I'm feeling more and more

491
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,249
like I want to spend time with him.

492
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,553
I want to go on a date with him again.

493
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,990
If we take more time,

494
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,428
I think we may be able
to build a good relationship.

495
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:49,167
Oh, Shun started acting sweet.

496
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,103
He hasn't said anything
about what might make Dai happy.

497
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,204
Not at all.

498
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,841
Dai has changed himself so much…

499
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,910
-Yeah.
-…that he's starting to lose himself.

500
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:03,548
I think it's fine to accommodate
to a point where you're comfortable.

501
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,384
It's important to compromise,

502
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,421
but if you have to change
to where you're no longer you,

503
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,989
then someday…

504
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,059
But trying to adapt to the person you like

505
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,960
is something that happens in love.

506
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,861
Yes.

507
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,197
Some people derive happiness from that.

508
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,032
-That's true.
-Yes.

509
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,735
Ikuo changed too.

510
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,237
-He suddenly toned himself down.
-Exactly.

511
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,506
Kazuto wrote, "Let's work together again."

512
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:33,211
-But the word "again" is almost criminal.
-It is a crime.

513
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,979
If you say it when you don't mean it,

514
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,283
you're giving them false hope,
like, "They wanna see me again."

515
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,785
As adults, we often say,
"Let's do this again."

516
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,554
"Let's go for a drink again."

517
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,556
-Just social etiquette.
-It happens.

518
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:49,327
But from Ikuo's side,
he may have expectations.

519
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,262
"Good morning."

520
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,764
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

521
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,371
"Kazuto will take the shift today."

522
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,841
-Am I the poster boy?
-Again.

523
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,378
"Please indicate if you would like
to work with Kazuto."

524
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:11,783
"If there are two or more candidates,
Kazuto can choose up to two."

525
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,687
-Have you made up your mind?
-Are you guys okay?

526
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,821
Are you ready?

527
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,091
There will be many raised hands.

528
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,495
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

529
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,163
Here we go.

530
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,098
What?

531
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,267
Everyone.

532
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,735
That's crazy.

533
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,337
Everyone?

534
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,773
Who will he choose?

535
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,574
Unbelievable.

536
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,309
-Yeah.
-Let's all go.

537
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,813
What am I gonna do?

538
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,449
Three or two.

539
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,584
Right?

540
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,354
Okay, I've decided.

541
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,676
Alan.

542
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,161
Gensei.

543
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,532
-Please work with me.
-I'd love to.

544
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,000
I'd love to.

545
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,537
Let's have fun.

546
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,806
The three of you. It's gonna be fun.

547
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,575
-Let's have fun.
-Sounds good.

548
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,913
I was so frustrated.

549
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,319
I was like, "Why didn't he choose me?"

550
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,022
I want

551
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,992
to spend more time with him.

552
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,596
It's frustrating.

553
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,466
I'm about to cry.

554
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,835
Yeah.

555
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,207
I feel so bad. He's so devoted.

556
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,109
He missed a precious opportunity.

557
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,151
Yay, let's do our best.

558
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,519
And have a lot of fun.

559
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,623
-We're open.
-Okay, we're open.

560
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,724
We're open.

561
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,691
Thank you.

562
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,664
Thank you for waiting.
Do you need any sugar?

563
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,366
-No, I'm fine.
-You're okay?

564
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,501
-Thank you. Take care.
-Thank you.

565
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,905
So cute.

566
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,276
Hi, Yuzu.

567
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,178
-How much did you say it was for one?
-It's 250 yen each.

568
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,381
-I'll take eight.
-Eight? Thank you.

569
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,816
Will you bag four of them separately?

570
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,151
Oh, I got it.

571
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,386
-Okay?
-Thank you.

572
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,755
You like Kazuto, right?

573
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,992
Come on. No need to say it outright.

574
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,427
What do you like about him?

575
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,696
I've heard if you can list ten things,

576
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,831
then that's a good sign.

577
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:14,732
Ten…

578
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,671
He was kind and attentive
when I first arrived.

579
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,107
It felt like he was watching over everyone
like a leader.

580
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,275
I found that attractive.

581
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:29,113
And when I talked to him,
he had a clear vision for the future.

582
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,682
He's strong-willed.

583
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,184
I respect him for that.

584
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,019
I get nervous when I'm alone with him.

585
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,854
I do.

586
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,990
I can't talk. I lose my groove.

587
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,593
It's so hard on me that he's not here now.

588
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,828
Why not contact him?

589
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,363
Yeah, message him.

590
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,531
-He shouldn't.
-No.

591
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,598
No, he shouldn't.

592
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,367
What an idea!

593
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,403
There's always someone who says,
"Just message them."

594
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,538
-Right.
-There is.

595
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,620
ARE YOU HAVING FUN
WITH THE THREE-PERSON SHIFT?

596
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,856
-Ryota sent a message again.
-Oh no.

597
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:18,997
It's so beautiful.

598
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,101
Thanks again for choosing me today.

599
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,002
Thank you.

600
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,636
Was it difficult to choose?

601
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,439
I thought you'd only choose Alan.

602
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,641
Why did you raise your hand today?

603
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,177
Well, I had wanted to work with Kazuto.

604
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,579
You haven't worked together?

605
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,546
We haven't.

606
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,750
I don't know how many more times
we can work together.

607
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,752
It may be the last time.

608
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,121
So I thought I'd go.

609
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,857
I had a feeling there'd be three.

610
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,327
I was sure you would choose one more.

611
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:50,828
Did you know?

612
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,431
Yeah. You're easy to read.

613
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,701
I hadn't worked with you or Gensei.

614
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,935
-Right.
-Yeah.

615
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,607
You chose me
because you'd never worked with me?

616
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,275
Yeah.

617
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,684
Did he want Gensei there
to alleviate any tension?

618
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,853
-He didn't want to be trapped.
-Yeah.

619
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,058
Tomorrow, why don't we have dinner early

620
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,760
and drink the night away?

621
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,828
Drink the night away?

622
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,196
I don't know about everyone else,

623
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,565
but there are things
we can only say at night.

624
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,335
Great. It's nice
to have a drink sometimes.

625
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,671
Do you have time now?

626
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,510
-They're getting along now?
-What are they doing?

627
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,879
Applying oil or something?

628
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,014
-A massage?
-Lotion?

629
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,948
Are you sure?

630
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,753
Yeah, here.

631
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,998
Look at you. Great job.

632
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:01,966
What?

633
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,569
Good night.

634
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,237
They're lovey-dovey.

635
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,772
They're back together.

636
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,974
Kazuto didn't notice the hug at all.

637
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,843
That's true. He must be exhausted.

638
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,144
He's tired.

639
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,846
They're hugging so passionately.

640
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,116
He must be worn out
if he didn't notice that.

641
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,225
So, about staying up late tonight.

642
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,993
What's the plan?

643
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,629
Are we gonna have dinner first?

644
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:32,530
Yeah.

645
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,100
After we clean up, once we're all…

646
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,902
Like a pajama party.

647
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,372
The whole "showing our true selves"
sort of bothers me.

648
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,479
Some people are more relaxed and can be
themselves when they drink alcohol.

649
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:54,285
But I think everyone has
different ways of showing themselves.

650
00:35:55,086 --> 00:36:00,558
For me, I like being in a more sober state
when expressing myself

651
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,527
and seeing others express themselves.

652
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,196
Everyone has different motivations…

653
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,197
You know,

654
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:11,002
I can usually show my true self
at the dinner table.

655
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,971
If we spent more time at dinner,

656
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,574
I'd be very comfortable.

657
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,077
I want to enjoy my meal during mealtime.

658
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,882
I also don't like to do many chores
before I go to bed.

659
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,370
The conversation surrounding me
was going nowhere.

660
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,408
I went into a negative space…

661
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,016
"Good morning."

662
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,086
-Good morning.
-"Today's shift will be announced."

663
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,022
"Dai will be taking the shift today."

664
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:05,923
Yes.

665
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,201
"Please indicate
if you'd like to work with Dai."

666
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:24,308
"If there are two or more candidates,
Dai can choose up to two."

667
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,478
Are you ready?

668
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,420
If you want to work with me,
raise your hand.

669
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,197
Thank you.

670
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:51,802
Is this okay?

671
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,703
Yeah.

672
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,605
It's become a hassle.

673
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,907
It's a hassle.

674
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,176
-Shun-chan.
-Come on.

675
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,712
You don't have much time left.

676
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,992
Please work with me.

677
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,996
Ikuo is cute. He has a big smile.

678
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,097
I'll do my best.

679
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,803
I almost raised my fist.

680
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,473
I don't think
I have any reason to apologize.

681
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,775
I was shocked.

682
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,283
-What?
-What happened?

683
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,319
Stop with the sneak peeks!

684
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,587
Dai doesn't normally say he's shocked.

685
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,023
It has always been the other way around.

686
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,225
He clearly expressed his feelings.

687
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,328
He said he almost raised his fist.
