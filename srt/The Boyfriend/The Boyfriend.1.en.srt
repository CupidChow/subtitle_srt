1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,842
-Anyone on your mind?
-I felt a spark.

2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,478
I want to be with someone
who gives me butterflies.

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,080
When I think he's cute, that turns me on.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,083
ANYONE CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,255
Are you all in love?

6
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,757
Yes, I am.

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,425
It made me want a boyfriend.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,962
-Do you tell your parents?
-Yeah, I can tell them anything.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,632
"You will go on a sleepover date,
just the two of you."

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,836
THEIR TIME TOGETHER IS LIMITED

11
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,308
If we wait, happiness will never come.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,177
Why not try to make him fall for me?

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,348
I'm glad I could spend this time
with you guys.

14
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,584
In our world…

15
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,556
A STORY OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,392
I've been without my parents
from the time I was born.

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,762
I don't know what "family" is.

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,966
Why was I born this way?

19
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,957
Thank you for inviting me.

20
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,358
I'm Dai.

21
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,296
I'm 22 and a university student.

22
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:22,368
I've been through so much
that I believe I may never find love.

23
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:27,807
I really hope to find romance
or a great partner.

24
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,978
A vibe unique to that person.

25
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,514
I'm attracted to people
who are a bit eccentric.

26
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,352
What I worked up my courage to say
was totally ignored…

27
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,554
There is one hot guy.

28
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,555
What?

29
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,824
Nice to meet you.

30
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,892
Nice to meet you.

31
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,395
My name is Taeheon.

32
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,031
I turned 34 this year.

33
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,166
I'm a designer.

34
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,869
I'm from South Korea.

35
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:35,141
I'm drawn to people
who aren't also in the field of design.

36
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,747
It would be good if we could broaden
each other's perspectives.

37
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,450
I haven't come out to my family yet.

38
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,020
Well, all of my friends know.

39
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,023
I felt this could be a great opportunity

40
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,494
to openly express who I am to my family.

41
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,197
We can see the entrance a bit from here.

42
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,199
Yes, I saw you coming.

43
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,002
I thought,
"Oh, a good-looking guy is here."

44
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,952
-Hello.
-Hello.

45
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,121
Nice to meet you.

46
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,289
Nice to meet you.

47
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,557
Nice to meet you.

48
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,192
Please take a seat anywhere.

49
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,469
I'm Ryota. I am 28 years old.

50
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,473
I'm a model, and a barista at a café.

51
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:45,578
I don't think I need to decide
if I'm only attracted

52
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,114
to men or only women.

53
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,751
No matter who I love, that's who I am.

54
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,787
I'd like to accept that part of me.

55
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,592
If I'm attracted to someone
who already likes someone else,

56
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,762
I tend to step back and give up.

57
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,733
I hope I can grow and become brave enough

58
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,035
to make a move.

59
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,171
How tall are you?

60
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,373
182 centimeters.

61
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,640
You're tall.

62
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,111
I'm envious, really.

63
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,423
Someone is coming in.

64
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,060
There he is.

65
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:34,961
Hello.

66
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,496
-Hello.
-Hello.

67
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,433
-It's nice to see you.
-Nice to meet you.

68
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,135
Where should I go?

69
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,171
My name is Gensei. I'm 34 years old.

70
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,707
I'm a hair and makeup artist.

71
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,244
Of course, the best thing is to meet
someone compatible,

72
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,514
but it'd be nice to find romance.

73
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,116
It's a bit abstract,

74
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:02,088
but someone who is good-looking
and a bit masculine,

75
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,824
but with a sensitive side.

76
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,093
I tend to like that type.

77
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,009
Someone is…

78
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,510
We have one more.

79
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,147
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

80
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,849
Nice to meet you.

81
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,784
I'm Shun Nakanishi. Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,919
-Hello.
-You too.

83
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,525
I'm Shun Nakanishi, 23 years old.

84
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:44,597
My job is to create music, and I also DJ.

85
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:49,735
Ending up with the person I love
would make me happiest.

86
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,272
I'm the type of person
who thinks about marriage,

87
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,341
so I'm looking for someone
I can see a future with.

88
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,679
I'd like a relationship
in which we can grow together.

89
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,249
I want to have a same-sex marriage.

90
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,284
As for kids,

91
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,855
I'd like to adopt.

92
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,060
He didn't really walk the walk.

93
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,496
I thought, "Okay, I'm over it."

94
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,030
I want some space.

95
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,334
-I know.
-It pinged.

96
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,503
-Will you check, please?
-Should I look?

97
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,841
It says, "This is a notice."

98
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,842
Okay.

99
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,611
-A notice?
-What is it?

100
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,480
"Welcome to the Green Room."

101
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,283
Oh, this house is called the Green Room.

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,518
-That's cute.
-I know.

103
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,619
Because it's green.

104
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,157
"You will begin living together here
for about a month."

105
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,058
Your turn.

106
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,026
Me?

107
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,296
"'Green Room' is a surfing term."

108
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:56,802
"It refers to the sacred space
inside a barrel produced by a wave."

109
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,703
Here.

110
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,672
I hope I can read it.

111
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:04,810
"We hope this month will be
a brilliant time for all of you."

112
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,582
"We also hope you find
an irreplaceable partner."

113
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,019
-That's lovely.
-Please read this.

114
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,190
"Now, we've prepared
a coffee truck for you."

115
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,292
-Coffee?
-What?

116
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,528
"By running it together as a team,

117
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,531
we hope you can deepen your bonds."

118
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,735
"You are free to use the proceeds
as you wish."

119
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,003
That's how it is.

120
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,744
It started.

121
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,613
-This is good!
-Wonderful.

122
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,847
It's gripping already.

123
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,082
I'm psyched.

124
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,886
So now our new show,
The Boyfriend, has begun.

125
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,924
The cast is made up of young men
who are attracted to other men.

126
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,961
The boys will live together
for about a month.

127
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:59,765
It's a story of love and friendship.

128
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,070
Wait. Don't say it like
an announcement at a department store.

129
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,539
-I'm so psyched right now.
-Me too.

130
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,609
-The cast is really attractive.
-It's exciting.

131
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,143
The coffee truck…

132
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,514
They're going to run one together, right?

133
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,652
And they will be allowed to use
the proceeds as they wish.

134
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,756
You see a different side of a person
when you work together.

135
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,491
-I know!
-That's really true.

136
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,328
This will let them be alone with someone,
discuss various matters,

137
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,230
and bring them closer.

138
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,865
That's true.

139
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,634
Maybe someone will steal the money.

140
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,202
-What?
-No one will do that.

141
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,604
The episode title will be
"Today's Proceeds Are Gone."

142
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,074
We'd like to look forward
to such incidents though.

143
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,677
Durian, we've heard you are
an experienced drag queen?

144
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,948
Yes, I am. Usually, my makeup is
six times as thick.

145
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,216
-That much?
-Yes.

146
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,484
Yes, like this.

147
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,885
-Beautiful!
-So gorgeous.

148
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,620
That's how I usually look.

149
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,588
Amazing!

150
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,625
Since it's the first episode,
I came au naturel.

151
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,895
-So you'll show up with different looks?
-Please look forward to it.

152
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,964
-I'm so excited!
-That makes me happy.

153
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,600
The cast is well-balanced.

154
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,205
Gay guys tend to be
attracted to others with similar looks.

155
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,374
-Really?
-But they're well-balanced.

156
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:21,347
And it's not like they all hit it off
upon their first meeting.

157
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,684
They're like flowers in the bud stage.

158
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,952
They're like trembling buds.

159
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,189
That metaphor is damn good!

160
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,291
-You're such a pro.
-As expected.

161
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,959
I really like that vibe.

162
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,698
At the moment, Dai seems the quietest?

163
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,767
Or rather, as the youngest,

164
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,970
he might be able
to enchant the older contestants.

165
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,606
-I see.
-Impressive!

166
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,775
-I'm so excited!
-I am too.

167
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm even slightly sweating.

168
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,745
Oh, I know!

169
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,114
-Shall we decide on a name?
-Yes, let's.

170
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,249
-Let's do it.
-We need a name.

171
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,321
We have the keywords "coffee" and "truck."

172
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,392
And when we think of coffee,

173
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,761
we think of the word "brew."

174
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,531
Words like "beans" are common.

175
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,967
And so on.

176
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,738
This is an approach I propose.

177
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,939
He's like a teacher.

178
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,207
Apologies.

179
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:27,847
Since we're male,
we could name it "Boys'" something.

180
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,315
That could be cute.

181
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:36,188
But is there anyone
who doesn't define themselves as "he"?

182
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,791
I go by "he/him" for myself.

183
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,963
Then can "boys" be used
for the participants here?

184
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,138
What's this, off the bat?

185
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,007
There was seafood art?

186
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,575
What was that?

187
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:01,180
When we describe coffee,
we use specific terms.

188
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,381
"Smooth," for example.

189
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,951
I thought maybe we could use
an English adjective.

190
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:06,852
I see.

191
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,155
It's not really easy to remember.

192
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,157
It's not catchy, right?

193
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,391
It's not catchy.

194
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,965
Autumn?

195
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,301
-Should we show seasonality…
-No.

196
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,036
Maybe not…

197
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,112
What about "BL"?

198
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,614
That's so funny.

199
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,349
People who know will get it.

200
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,652
What?

201
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,153
-Latte?
-Oh, latte?

202
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,222
Too obvious?

203
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,090
Well…

204
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,928
So we're settled on the acronym "BL"?

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,299
As long as it feels right.

206
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,037
Hello.

207
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,576
"Friendly" evokes different images
depending on the individual.

208
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,579
Not all of us will be able
to spend the day selling…

209
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,513
Hello.

210
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,414
Hello.

211
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,815
Nice to meet you.

212
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,884
I'll be living here starting today.
I'm Kazuto.

213
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,552
Hi.

214
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,753
Hello.

215
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,422
It's so sudden.

216
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,890
Wow, a new cast member.

217
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,325
Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,163
I'm a chef, and I brought bonito today,
so I wanted to cook together tonight.

219
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,564
What? That's amazing.

220
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,632
That's so nice.

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,402
Another good-looking guy arrived.

222
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,638
It will be great if someone can cook.

223
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,572
Yes.

224
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,876
When Kazuto arrived,
I was super surprised.

225
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,211
He's the friendly, handsome type.

226
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,913
I think he must be popular.

227
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,717
He seems friendly and smart

228
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,919
but mysterious too.

229
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,053
He seems

230
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,357
really upbeat, or rather…

231
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,858
I feel like

232
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:58,631
he must have led
a totally different life from mine.

233
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,900
What's going on?

234
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,302
You've only exchanged greetings.

235
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,670
Don't be quick to judge.

236
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,809
I'm Kazuto. I'm 27 years old.
I manage a restaurant.

237
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:15,714
I joined this show because
I want to find a life partner.

238
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,551
I work from the afternoon
through to the night.

239
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,856
So if he's asleep when I get home,
and we could sleep together,

240
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,859
I would be very happy.

241
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,395
I'm the type of person
who wants to live with a partner.

242
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,065
I may have a crush on someone.

243
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,801
I'm kind of overwhelmed by my feelings.

244
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,404
This is too much. I can't do this anymore.

245
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,175
First, I'm planning to make a salad…

246
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,076
Okay.

247
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:49,281
…and make an ohitashi
with mushrooms since it's autumn.

248
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,351
Who can wash and cut the vegetables?

249
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,386
I can. I'll take care of the vegetables.

250
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,754
Is there a knife?

251
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,056
I'll leave it to you two.

252
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,092
-Need rice?
-Yes. I want someone to cook rice.

253
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,728
I'm going to fillet the fish

254
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,064
and make sashimi
and something like a carpaccio…

255
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,132
I'd like to eat carpaccio.

256
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,001
That's my plan.

257
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,745
-I'm gonna put it here.
-I've never seen it this close.

258
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,415
How can the three guys in the back
miss the filleting of the bonito?

259
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,317
You're right.

260
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,988
Bonito is really easy to fillet.

261
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,389
-I see.
-Yeah.

262
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,758
If a guy could fillet a fish…

263
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,727
-It'd be cool.
-It would be wonderful.

264
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,142
Is it okay to wash this?

265
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,377
Go ahead. Thank you.

266
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,359
Let's make a toast.

267
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,328
-It's good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

268
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,229
Amazing.

269
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,363
Thanks for the food.

270
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,198
Thanks for the food.

271
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,099
Delicious.

272
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,200
I like the meat.

273
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,268
Yeah, it's so good.

274
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,269
Is it?

275
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,305
-Good?
-Yeah.

276
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,809
It's amazing that you can
fillet a bonito at home.

277
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,777
Seriously.

278
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,978
Is that a sauna?

279
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,646
It's a sauna.

280
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,914
Wow, great.

281
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,015
Let's make use of it.

282
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,784
-Seriously.
-Let's make it routine.

283
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,684
Totally.

284
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,421
We were talking earlier
about taking turns in the bath…

285
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,089
Yeah, let's decide!

286
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,957
-There are two, right?
-Yes, two.

287
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,893
Who wants to take a bath tonight?

288
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,028
I do. I definitely want to.

289
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,997
I won't use it.

290
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,498
-Just a shower?
-Yeah.

291
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,067
I prefer a shower too.

292
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,068
I'll take a shower.

293
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,503
It's so cold.
You're okay with just a shower?

294
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,908
Why did you guys want
to participate in this show?

295
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:04,683
I realized that I've never
faced romance head-on.

296
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,486
I was hoping for a nice encounter.

297
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,289
So it's amazing to meet you all.

298
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,024
What a great remark.

299
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,158
That was too lovely.

300
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,593
-And you?
-Me?

301
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,430
In this world,

302
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:25,037
it's very difficult to find a friend,
let alone a best friend.

303
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,141
Whether I find romance or not,

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,944
I want to foster
a strong connection with all of you

305
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,014
so that our relationship
can endure long after this show.

306
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,552
Oh, did it ring?

307
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,089
Did it really ring?

308
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,891
"This is a notice for you."

309
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,095
"Your first day at Green Room
is about to end."

310
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,031
"Tonight, as you recall the day,

311
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,702
please write a letter
to just one of the participants."

312
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,106
"However, please do not sign your name."

313
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,841
Oh, it's anonymous.

314
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,178
-What? Wait!
-Already?

315
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,479
-Already?
-It's anonymous.

316
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,682
-They won't sign their name.
-They won't know who it's from.

317
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,118
-What? That's so thrilling.
-This is just too much fun.

318
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,988
"Drop your letter
in the recipient's mailbox

319
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,322
on their door tonight."

320
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,358
That's why we have a mailbox.

321
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,659
Interesting.

322
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,928
"Check your mailbox tomorrow morning."

323
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,964
What if there's nothing there?

324
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,500
What can you do?

325
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,102
Please, no.

326
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,639
"May your heart reach
the person you like."

327
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,379
-Bye.
-Have a good night.

328
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,813
Good night.

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,217
-Good night.
-Good night.

330
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,119
Have a good night.

331
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,987
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

332
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,741
When you write to someone,
you realize how much you like them.

333
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,943
That's true.

334
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,445
When you have an outlet, right?

335
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,447
Like, "Oh, I do like them."

336
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,416
I'm pretty set on one person.

337
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,453
If someone sent me a letter,
I'd be curious.

338
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,389
I'm worried. What if I don't get a letter?

339
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,558
That would mean I'm very unattractive.

340
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,326
I think I'll get none.

341
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,661
-What, Shun?
-Shun!

342
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,630
-He's super negative.
-Shun is negative.

343
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,697
-Shun.
-Shun.

344
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,114
I wrote to Kazuto.

345
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,684
He led everyone in the kitchen.

346
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,986
I had a good impression of him.

347
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,634
I'M HAPPY WE MET
THANKS FOR THE DELICIOUS MEAL

348
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:20,238
I was happy because this person
wrote quite a lot to me.

349
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,876
It's a hunch,
but I think it's Dai or Shun.

350
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:26,978
One of those two.

351
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,432
Does that mean
they weren't evenly dispersed?

352
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,900
It's possible.

353
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,763
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU YET,
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE

354
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,499
I wrote to Dai.

355
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,603
I felt the most comfortable with Dai.

356
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,306
I'm grateful he's here… I think.

357
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,448
I think I'll get none.

358
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,684
I don't think anyone

359
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,754
among them would like me.

360
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,270
-He got one.
-He did get one, see?

361
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,005
He must be happy.

362
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,243
I'm pretty set on one person.

363
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,245
Definitely Shun.

364
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,653
First, I'll tell him I'm attracted to him.

365
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,990
Since I couldn't sign my name,
he may not know it's from me.

366
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,392
He's attractive.

367
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,663
Seriously. I totally want
to sleep with him today.

368
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,765
I don't want to sleep alone.

369
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,484
Whoa, three letters?

370
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,352
-Dai!
-So that's how it goes.

371
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,321
Being carefree reigns supreme.

372
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,635
I received three letters.

373
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:08,173
I couldn't be happier
if one of them was from Shun.

374
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,477
DAI, YOU WERE VERY EASY TO TALK TO TODAY.

375
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,180
LET'S MAKE SOME FUN MEMORIES
AT THE GREEN ROOM

376
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,348
FROM GENSEI

377
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,283
DAI, WHILE EVERYONE WAS NERVOUS
ON THE FIRST DAY,

378
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,951
YOUR BRIGHT PERSONALITY CHEERED ME UP.

379
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,786
LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING TIME WITH YOU!

380
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,687
FROM KAZUTO

381
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,394
DAI, BY TALKING TO ME AND DOING
FUNNY THINGS, YOU HELPED ME RELAX!

382
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,764
THANKS FOR YOUR SMILES.
LET'S CONTINUE TO HAVE FUN TOMORROW.

383
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,665
FROM RYOTA

384
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,901
Shun didn't write to Dai, then.

385
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:41,206
No one was even my type.

386
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,383
I like the idea of an anonymous letter.

387
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,918
I agree.

388
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,153
It really strikes a chord.

389
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,957
The fact you don't know the sender

390
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,026
makes you think about the letter more.

391
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,428
You'd look for clues the next day.

392
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,165
For now, it may be that
they wrote the letters

393
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,702
because they got along as friends.

394
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,938
I'm sure there's
a romantic attraction too.

395
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,675
Whether one should go from friendship
to romance is a difficult decision.

396
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,842
That's right. Yeah.

397
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,611
Once you get into the friend zone…

398
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,512
Yes.

399
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,747
Within five seconds of meeting someone,

400
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,884
I decide if they're
lover or friend material

401
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,952
from my first impression.

402
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,187
Know what I mean?

403
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,222
If your friendship becomes too good,

404
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,859
it's tough to turn it into romance.

405
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,561
-It's difficult.
-It's awkward.

406
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,365
Especially in situations where
both friendship and romance are possible.

407
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,868
It makes me wonder what will happen.

408
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,873
-I'm concerned about Shun's negativity.
-Yes, it's worrisome.

409
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,875
He mentioned marriage and kids.

410
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,545
He's thinking so much about the future,

411
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,948
he may not be able
to casually step into something.

412
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:02,153
He may have had painful experiences
with love in the past.

413
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,457
Everyone is incredibly earnest.

414
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,359
Not one of them seems mean-spirited.

415
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,526
They're dazzling.

416
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,262
Can that really be?
Their true natures may come out.

417
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,163
-Oh?
-What?

418
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,732
-It will.
-Right?

419
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,667
Not a chance. I mean…

420
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,403
There's no way they're all so earnest.

421
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,540
What's up with that dark outlook, Horan?

422
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,857
Okay.

423
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,259
I'M SORRY I CAN'T JOIN YOU TODAY

424
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,662
I MADE BREAKFAST,
SO PLEASE ENJOY WITH EVERYONE

425
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,863
FROM KAZUTO

426
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,506
What? How nice!

427
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,641
-No way.
-What a lovely person.

428
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,742
I'd fall for him.

429
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,045
Amazing.

430
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,880
What a proper breakfast.

431
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,848
I wonder if he woke up really early.

432
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,184
Yeah, it seemed he woke up early.

433
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,053
You didn't hear him, right?

434
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,889
The miso soup is so good.

435
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,691
-This dashi, isn't it good?
-Yeah.

436
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,762
I'll be away for the evening today.

437
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:23,001
I'll join everyone again tomorrow morning.

438
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,104
So I'll be stepping out for a little bit.

439
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,072
-Okay.
-Sure.

440
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,841
Thank you for the food.

441
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:30,942
Thank you, Kazuto.

442
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,577
Thank you very much.

443
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,080
Considering the times, let's ask the AI.

444
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,081
TRUCK NAME DECISION

445
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,682
Help us…

446
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,750
A helper.

447
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,489
It's a truck run by five or six men

448
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,227
that departs from a house
called "Green Room."

449
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,429
Can you provide names for a coffee truck?

450
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,198
What? Is it possible?

451
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,265
Amazing.

452
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,900
-By providing information?
-Yes.

453
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,103
-What? Seriously?
-Isn't it crazy?

454
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,874
Oh, here. "Brewtiful" came up.

455
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,978
We "brew" coffee,
and it becomes "beautiful."

456
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,113
Is it lame?

457
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,615
Not at all. I love it.

458
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,151
T, I, F, U, and L.

459
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,589
"Brewtiful" and "U"?

460
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,623
U.

461
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,592
-Nice.
-Yay!

462
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,128
-It's settled.
-We finally decided on a name.

463
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,130
Thank you, everyone.

464
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,097
Thank you.

465
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,600
COFFEE MAKING TRAINING

466
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,601
Hello.

467
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,903
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

468
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,571
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

469
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,039
Thank you.

470
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:39,644
We're here to teach you
how to make coffee today.

471
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,312
Thank you.

472
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,883
We'd like to divide you into groups.

473
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,020
Please divide yourselves
into two groups of two and three.

474
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,357
-What should we do?
-Do you wanna do it together?

475
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,692
Rock, paper, scissors?

476
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,829
-Two and three?
-Two and three?

477
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,264
Okay.

478
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:12,243
Over here, I'd like to explain
how to make drip coffee.

479
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,879
Pour up to 300.

480
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,947
It smells good.

481
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,384
The aroma is more pronounced than before.

482
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,985
Yes, I feel like it is.

483
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,954
Now it's done.

484
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,489
It's dark, isn't it?

485
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,024
-Probably.
-"Probably"?

486
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,058
Unenthusiastic.

487
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,666
Let's practice.

488
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,839
It tastes more robust than before.

489
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,243
-Let's start.
-Okay.

490
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,447
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

491
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,350
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

492
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,552
-Bye for now.
-See you.

493
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,254
-I'll be going.
-Okay.

494
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,789
-Take care.
-Thanks for today.

495
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,436
When Dai left, he was like, "See you."

496
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,337
Well done!

497
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,504
It was good, right?

498
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,472
Impressive.

499
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,841
-Was that intentional?
-Of course!

500
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,076
Definitely!

501
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,510
-Yeah.
-That was impressive.

502
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,780
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

503
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,617
-Thank you for coming today.
-Happy birthday!

504
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,753
Thank you. I'm turning 23.

505
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,656
BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH FRIENDS

506
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,892
Dai, you're all living together, right?

507
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,894
Anyone you're interested in?

508
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,295
His friends are direct!

509
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,296
They are.

510
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,797
I like these ladies.

511
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,066
They're definitely direct.

512
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,903
Well, there's one really good-looking guy.

513
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,972
What's he like?

514
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,574
Is he your type?

515
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,975
-He must be.
-What's the type?

516
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,345
There's a guy named Shun, and he's…

517
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,413
He's crazy hot?

518
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,748
What?

519
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:01,686
And today, we learned how to make coffee.

520
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,988
We had training with everyone.

521
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,190
The five of us split into groups
of two and three.

522
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,193
And I was next to Shun at the time.

523
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,096
He said, "Do you wanna do it together?"

524
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,331
That's great!

525
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,366
-So you two were together?
-Yeah.

526
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,969
-I thought, "It's just the two of us."
-He's interested.

527
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,470
Yeah, he was smooth.

528
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,674
I don't know,
but it wasn't really like that.

529
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,709
-Maybe he's just a natural.
-He's used to it?

530
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,146
But that makes us dance to their tune.

531
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,647
Yes, I'm a dancing puppet.

532
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,549
I'm furiously dancing.

533
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,584
-You can't help it.
-Yeah.

534
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,619
But he's hot!

535
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,488
-He's so good-looking.
-I really want to see his face!

536
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:41,059
I like pure-hearted people.

537
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:41,960
Pure-hearted?

538
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,027
Yes, pure-hearted.

539
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,797
Youthful.

540
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:46,698
Youthful?

541
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,867
Yes. And someone
who doesn't make me feel insecure.

542
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,805
-Shun.
-You feel strongly about Shun.

543
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,806
I'm into Shun.

544
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,307
You're worried?

545
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,210
-But you could get anyone you're after.
-No, stop.

546
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,446
-I agree.
-All the guys are seriously attractive.

547
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,881
-I see.
-You're the most attractive, Dai!

548
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,817
I think I can gradually make Shun mine.

549
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,085
I think so too.

550
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,488
He's very calm, really.

551
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,491
I tend to expect too much from my partner.

552
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,627
I'd like someone
who can accept that part of me

553
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,197
and has a strong will…

554
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:24,902
I'm hoping that I can find a good partner.

555
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,090
Nice!

556
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,133
Whoa, Dai!

557
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,367
He's so built.

558
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,303
What? You don't get a body like that
with just any exercise.

559
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,271
No way.

560
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,540
Dai really works out.

561
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,595
Dai had the ideal body.

562
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:31,903
He's slim with no fat on his face
and has extremely toned abs.

563
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,306
I definitely like Taeheon's body.

564
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,745
His body is so sexy, isn't it?

565
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,747
I was so surprised.

566
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,116
Shun is also quite

567
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,984
toned.

568
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,754
But I kind of expected it.

569
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:54,525
I had seen his pecs through his shirt
and the way he watches his diet.

570
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,363
I knew he wasn't a person
who didn't care about his body.

571
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,269
Rather than someone who's ripped,

572
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,776
I feel more relaxed
with someone less toned.

573
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:17,715
Someone with a belly wouldn't bother me.

574
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:23,354
Kazuto's kindness and sincerity

575
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,923
are starting to seem fake to me.

576
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,225
Hey.

577
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,861
His personality is too innocuous.

578
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:34,065
Right, since he's so neutral,
he can't get close…

579
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:38,536
Well, he's close with everyone
but can't get any closer.

580
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:43,040
He's 27, so his experiences
may have become like…

581
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,344
-Like a barrier?
-Yes, he may have built a barrier.

582
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,247
Will his nice personality work for
or against him in love?

583
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,251
Yeah, I feel like
we haven't seen his true self yet.

584
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,920
You're right. We can't see his true face.

585
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,223
-Another wonderful day.
-Thank you so much.

586
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,291
I didn't cook at all.

587
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,593
I brought two kinds.

588
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,062
One is spicy, and the other is not.

589
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,798
Here's to our great day.

590
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,967
Let's dig in.

591
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,069
This is so good.

592
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:12,970
Delish!

593
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,839
-It's so delicious.
-Yeah.

594
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,942
Are you attracted to women?

595
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,680
My last relationship was with a woman.

596
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,182
-What?
-Oh, I see.

597
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:30,188
I like both,
but maybe that sounds a little unfair.

598
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:36,527
But I mostly date men,
and I feel more comfortable that way.

599
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,997
Do you mean
you're sexually attracted to both?

600
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,802
With men, it usually starts with,
"Oh, he's sexy."

601
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,838
But with women, it starts with emotions.

602
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,676
Only after falling for them
have I taken the next step.

603
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,679
Is anyone else bisexual?

604
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,748
Me. I'm the same as Dai.

605
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,918
They could fall in love
with anyone in the world.

606
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,157
It feels like it would increase
the competition.

607
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,858
It raises the bar.

608
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:12,396
If women are also included,
I don't feel like I could win.

609
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,565
There'd be too many rivals.

610
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,134
I'd be jealous of a female.

611
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:23,507
There have always been bisexuals
in gay circles, of course,

612
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,612
but it was rare for them to be able
to unabashedly say, "I'm bisexual."

613
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,781
I mean, even if you're gay…

614
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:36,220
you might tend to see
bisexuals as living in a different world.

615
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,023
So it was nice that they came out
without any hesitation.

616
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,124
Yeah, it was great.

617
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,995
As Shun said, is it true
there'd be more reason for jealousy?

618
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,098
It's possible, especially if you're young.

619
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:52,203
Shun was like, "If women are rivals,
there's no chance I can win."

620
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,038
It's probably a source of worry.

621
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:01,445
We need to decide
what to sell in the coffee truck.

622
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:05,283
So far, we've decided on
hot and iced latte.

623
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,753
And hot and iced drip coffee.

624
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,688
Then for the filters…

625
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,325
It says, "This is a notice for you."

626
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,627
-I haven't heard that sound in a while.
-Yeah.

627
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,530
"You are going to go meet
a new cast member tonight."

628
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,399
They're going to go meet him?

629
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,833
Is that it?

630
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,469
-I'm excited.
-Me too.

631
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,105
-He could be a rival.
-I don't like that kind of thing.

632
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,309
It says, "Going to go meet."
Where are we going?

633
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,841
Anyone you're interested in?

634
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,109
Interested in?

635
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,210
Yes.

636
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,346
You look happy!

637
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,084
Then the person who loses
in rock, paper, scissors will go first.

638
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,418
Who you're interested in.

639
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,821
-Name the person I'm interested in?
-Yeah.

640
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,356
No, I can't do that.

641
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,125
Dai is carefree and going for it.

642
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,059
That's it.

643
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,628
Oh, he's got the advantage.

644
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,866
A game where you say the name
of the person you're interested in.

645
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,836
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
Loser says the name.

646
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,404
Then let's do it with everyone.

647
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,805
With everyone?

648
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,342
This is a confession, right?

649
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,878
It's gonna be a confession.

650
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,480
Who do we tell?

651
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,549
-Let's tell everyone.
-No, not everyone!

652
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,618
A person you can trust.

653
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,856
Let's do it!

654
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,991
Rock, scissors, paper. One, two, three!

655
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,394
Rock, scissors, paper.

656
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,294
Yes!

657
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,063
Seriously?

658
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,264
This sucks!

659
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,298
DAI AND GENSEI LOST

660
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,566
Who will you tell?

661
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,535
I'm going to tell Shun.

662
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,938
If you open the phone, you'll see it.

663
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,076
How about you, Gensei?

664
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,480
Look at both. Have you looked already?

665
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,049
Are you looking?

666
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,586
I'm still exploring my feelings,

667
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,456
but I want to talk to Kazuto a bit more,

668
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,091
which is what I wrote.

669
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,562
I wrote "Shun" on my iPhone
and handed it to him.

670
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,431
I just thought I'd go for it.

671
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,932
I figured he already knew.

672
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,302
Hey, wait. Dai is a formidable guy.

673
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,537
That's incredible!

674
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,905
He's a love monster.

675
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,874
Is "attack"
the only word in his dictionary?

676
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,062
A big smile on his face.

677
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,430
This is good!

678
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,766
But what a thrilling development!

679
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,034
Dai is impressive!

680
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,402
He struck his heart.

681
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,807
Wow, that's amazing!

682
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,585
They all have incredible muscles.

683
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,492
Is one of them the new cast member?

684
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,794
A new cast member?

685
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,538
I want it to be him on the far end.

686
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,907
I know what you mean.

687
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,208
Farthest end.

688
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,947
-He's famous.
-He is famous.

689
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,482
He's unreachable.

690
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,019
-Isn't he sexy?
-The man is…

691
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,321
-He's sexy, right?
-In a different league.

692
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,223
He's super sexy!

693
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,432
We'll get to meet the new cast member
right after, won't we?

694
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,375
The fave for me and Ryota.

695
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,810
Him or the slender one.

696
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,779
-Oh, right.
-With the beard.

697
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,382
We predict one of those two.

698
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,287
-Excuse me.
-What?

699
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,389
The man from earlier came.

700
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,390
This is crazy!

701
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,458
Nice to meet you.

702
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,961
I'm Usak, the go-go boy.

703
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,031
I'm the new cast member.

704
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,033
-This is awesome.
-Thanks for having me.

705
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,635
-We're happy to have you.
-I'm excited!

706
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,640
He's one of the most popular
go-go boys in Japan.

707
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,609
This will change things.

708
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,244
Most definitely.

709
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,745
I can't believe this.

710
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,814
I was like, "He really came."

711
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:08,152
I've only seen him on stage or on flyers.

712
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,792
So I'm kind of in a panic.

713
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,028
I'm not calm about the situation.

714
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,264
He's too hot.

715
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,766
I'm looking forward to the future.

716
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,301
You were so cool.

717
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,604
You were so bright on stage. The best.

718
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,173
-We thought it couldn't be you.
-No.

719
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,575
Are you serious? I'm very happy.

720
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,512
-Okay, to our friendship.
-To our friendship.

721
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,355
You were my fave. I wanted it to be you.

722
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,557
-Hey, Dai.
-No.

723
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,802
See!

724
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,105
-This is great!
-Shun!
