00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,949
"Shun will take the shift today."

ARTIST

UNIVERSITY STUDENT

4
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,459
Well, they're a cause for concern.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,128
Photos like that.

6
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,597
MODEL AND CAFÉ MANAGER

7
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,631
It's Shun.

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,334
I like him.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,694
Whoa, he went for him!

10
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,898
-Now we know.
-He chose him?

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,399
We thought it was Ryota, didn't we?

12
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,535
They're going to deepen their bond.

13
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,969
Definitely.

14
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,707
-Please work with me.
-I'd be happy to.

15
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,985
FROM TAIWAN, HAIR AND MAKEUP ARTIST

16
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,423
We're off.

17
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,358
Have fun.

18
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,259
Bye!

19
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,971
I was surprised today.

20
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,375
That Shun chose Dai.

21
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,043
GO-GO DANCER

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,879
-I thought he might choose him.
-Yeah.

23
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,381
Really? You all expected it?

24
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,184
Dai chose Shun,

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,752
and Shun chose Dai.

26
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,254
It's a match made in heaven.

27
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,957
Yeah, if both of them

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,960
are interested in each other,

29
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,563
that may be true.

30
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,064
Yeah.

31
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,209
Excuse me.

32
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,352
A cookie and a small iced coffee, please.

33
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,286
Sure.

34
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,056
They should be ready
in less than five minutes.

35
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:43,990
We'll be over here.

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,930
I'll give this to them. Where are they?

37
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,239
Please enjoy.

38
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,081
Shun isn't saying anything.

40
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,515
Is he just waiting?

41
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,251
-Yes, I think so.
-Right?

42
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,855
If you're interested in someone,
would you be assertive

43
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,458
and speak to the person?

44
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,892
To show interest?

45
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,895
I don't usually.

46
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,697
-You don't?
-No.

47
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,632
Really?

48
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,800
Why is that?

49
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,136
I don't want them to know.

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,407
And did that ever work out?

51
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,675
Never.

52
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,077
What about you, Ryota?

53
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,747
Me? If I was interested in someone?

54
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,648
Yeah.

55
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,385
I wouldn't make my interest obvious,

56
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,021
but I'd want to spend more time with them.

57
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,390
If I'm interested in someone,

58
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,860
the amount of time we hang out

59
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,664
and the amount of time we chat
may naturally increase.

60
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,472
-Thank you for today.
-Yeah.

61
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,707
Thank you.

62
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,180
I was super happy that you chose me today.

63
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,516
I hesitated though.

64
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,984
-You did?
-That's right.

65
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,719
Why did you hesitate?

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,823
I'm not really sure sometimes.

67
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,359
Why?

68
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,862
My feelings of interest in you

69
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,065
may not be real.

70
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,836
It may be that
because I know you're interested,

71
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,573
I may be under the illusion
that I like you too.

72
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,310
I'm not sure about my feelings.

73
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,046
Frankly speaking,

74
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,217
I think maybe a kiss…

75
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,520
might make it clear.

76
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,823
In this case,

77
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,891
if we kiss…

78
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,929
I'll know if I really like you.

79
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,864
Oh, I see.

80
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,667
What did he say?

81
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,802
Do it. Before the sun goes down!

82
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,774
Right now, I'm not sure.

83
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,610
After another two weeks,

84
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,080
I wonder what I'll be feeling.

85
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,217
That's where I'm at.

86
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,254
I'm looking forward to finding out,

87
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,722
but I'm anxious.

88
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:35,795
In order to eliminate that anxiety,
I'm trying to be discerning.

89
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,664
That's where I am.

90
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,879
Should we get going?

91
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,014
Okay.

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,851
Let's go.

93
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,752
Stand up.

94
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:01,988
Huh?

95
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,190
-What?
-Give me your hand.

96
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,793
What?

97
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,760
-What?
-Let's kiss.

98
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,061
-No.
-Why?

99
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,196
I don't want to.

100
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,265
Not now.

101
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,240
When I feel…

102
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,412
comfortable, then I'll kiss you.

103
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,723
If we kiss now,
I'll be even more confused.

104
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,595
-Why not?
-Why?

105
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,997
-Now's the time!
-I guess it's not.

106
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,567
He said a kiss now would confuse him,

107
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,603
but it let Dai feel like
his chances are not zero.

108
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,105
Shun is such a schemer…

109
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,441
He's the type that gets you hooked.

110
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,143
Yes, it'd be easy to get addicted.

111
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,912
-Shun is very complicated.
-It's riveting.

112
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,880
This is great.

113
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,782
It really is great.

114
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,118
Both are the type that can get you hooked.

115
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:10,590
It's a matter
of who's got the stronger hook.

116
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,491
That's true.

117
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,893
Right, both are addictive.

118
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,731
I can see the two of them
French kissing within a few days.

119
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,299
I see, yeah.

120
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:24,971
The tension between them
will keep winding tighter and tighter…

121
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,173
-And smooch!
-…until they smooch!

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,008
I don't know about that.

123
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,465
And…

124
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,536
Is this your underwear?

125
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,004
The rest are yours.

126
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,874
He loves him a lot.

127
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,809
That's right.

128
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,078
-Can I hide the bags under your eyes?
-Please do.

129
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,014
There's a line here, right?

130
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,982
You should start from here.

131
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,150
Below the line?

132
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,585
-Yes.
-I see.

133
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,320
Start with a darker color,

134
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,124
apply it, and spread it out, okay?

135
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,826
Then apply pressure with your fingers…

136
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,628
Oh? It disappeared.

137
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,698
Is this makeup
just to remove dark circles?

138
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,967
I don't need any around the area?

139
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,535
No, you have beautiful skin.

140
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,704
You don't need it.

141
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,739
Your freckles are adorable.

142
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,042
Your eyebrows are well-grown.

143
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,277
Your eyelashes are amazingly long.

144
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,079
I like the width of your forehead.

145
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,352
Gensei thinks that Ryota likes him,

146
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,155
but actually, isn't Gensei more into him?

147
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,957
-Yes, he is.
-I think so.

148
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,362
We've all had a chance to go sell.

149
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,330
Yeah.

150
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,364
What location worked?

151
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,600
-The third day was good.
-Yeah.

152
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,335
That's a good place to go.

153
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,637
We could've hit 10,000 yen
even on a weekday.

154
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,872
-Yeah.
-It's definitely an option.

155
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,209
The place Kazuto and I went to
was a park about 20 minutes away.

156
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,811
-So close.
-Yes, it's close.

157
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,348
There were many families and couples.

158
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,785
-What?
-Huh?

159
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,420
Now? Unbelievable.

160
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,655
Hey, hey, hey!

161
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,093
This is a kind of ferry terminal,

162
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,762
so there's a good flow of people.

163
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,470
People gather at roadside stations
and ferry terminals,

164
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,606
so if we try circling around a station…

165
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,778
Whoa, he's lit!

166
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,115
-An assertive one.
-There may be a storm coming.

167
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:54,053
I think we'll succeed in hitting
our target profit margins…

168
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:03,095
Not all of us may remember, but…

169
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,531
Oh, good timing.

170
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,767
What?

171
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,037
Someone you know?

172
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,571
Yeah.

173
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,275
This is insane.

174
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,612
-Hello.
-Good morning.

175
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,713
Nice to meet you.

176
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,783
My name is Alan.
I'll be living with you starting today.

177
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,118
We're happy to have you.

178
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,320
My name is Alan.

179
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,458
I work for an overseas IT company.

180
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,592
FROM BRAZIL

181
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,462
I'm part Brazilian, Italian,
and a quarter Japanese.

182
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,932
I identify culturally as Brazilian,
but the place I live is Japan.

183
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,535
I'm quite assertive.

184
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,472
When I meet someone who's my type,
I'll be like, "I like you."

185
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,208
I felt a spark.

186
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,476
-Wash each other?
-Huh?

187
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,644
Wanna wash each other?

188
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,912
No, I can't.

189
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,818
Crazy. Can I sit?

190
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,753
-You can sit anywhere.
-Over there?

191
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,788
-Let him sit in the middle.
-He's a friend?

192
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,789
He's my friend.

193
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,225
Wow, Usak!

194
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,261
Holy crap.

195
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,130
Hug me. Let's hug first.

196
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,532
This is insane!

197
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,105
I'm so happy. I want to hug everyone.

198
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,973
What were you all doing?

199
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,374
Nice to meet you.

200
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,210
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Alan.

201
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,111
I'm Taeheon.

202
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,078
-What?
-Taeheon.

203
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:26,979
Taeheon?

204
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,748
Nice to meet you. I'm Alan.

205
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,483
-I'm Ryota.
-Aw, Ryota.

206
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,418
This is crazy, Dai.

207
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,586
It's been a while.

208
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,954
This is almost funny.

209
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,090
-Glad you're doing well.
-They know each other.

210
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,326
-This is crazy.
-How are you?

211
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,794
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

212
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,329
I'm Shun.

213
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,497
-Huh?
-I'm Shun.

214
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,464
-Shun?
-Yes.

215
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,066
-I'm Alan.
-Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,069
It's unusual to go around the table
and hug people like this.

217
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,471
I'm Alan. Nice to meet you.

218
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,372
I'm Gensei.

219
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,840
-Gensei?
-I'm Alan.

220
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,308
Nice to meet you.

221
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,745
This is insane.
Wait, am I being too loud coming in?

222
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,214
Not at all. It's perfect.

223
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,415
You're going full throttle.

224
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,583
It's too crazy.

225
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:11,023
Hey, Alan, you know Usak and Dai?

226
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,926
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Dai, how did we meet?

227
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,696
Well, I DMed you on Instagram
because you were hot.

228
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,031
Oh yeah?

229
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,300
Was it me first, or was it you? You?

230
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,201
Yeah.

231
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,604
But you were seeing someone at the time.

232
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,572
Right.

233
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,242
We've been connected ever since
with no weird exchanges or anything.

234
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,244
"Weird exchanges"?

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,484
I wouldn't call our relationship
very deep,

236
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:43,422
but we did go "all the way."

237
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,458
So they did sleep together.

238
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,593
They did.

239
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,830
That means that they were
attracted to each other in the past.

240
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,831
Of course.

241
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,976
Usak, that's not fair. It's super unfair!

242
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,478
Hey, hey, wait.

243
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,482
-Don't burn yourselves!
-It's hot.

244
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,284
Just bear it.

245
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
-Let's switch sides.
-Yeah.

246
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,022
-Shun.
-What?

247
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,190
This must be hard.

248
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,060
-You're fitting in better than anyone.
-That's not true.

249
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,661
I can't believe you just arrived.

250
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,097
Are you all right?
You're not feeling bothered by me?

251
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,932
-Well, I don't know…
-Or, you know…

252
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,967
Bothered? No.

253
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,901
No?

254
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,271
When you think about it,

255
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,174
the next month will be so memorable.

256
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,176
You don't get opportunities like this.

257
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,311
It's incredible. I'm having a lot of fun.

258
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,481
It's so fun.
We should just enjoy it, right?

259
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,983
We should just enjoy it.

260
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,556
Will Alan's arrival

261
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,058
be encouragement for Shun and Dai,

262
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,428
or will it bring about their end?

263
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,499
But Shun's feelings for Dai
are flourishing, aren't they?

264
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,103
Shun knows that better than anyone,

265
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,171
but he can't accept it either.

266
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,842
It must be a real struggle
for Shun right now.

267
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,879
Shun has to do things differently
from his past relationships.

268
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,714
Until now, others made the effort…

269
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,584
-He was passive.
-Yes, he received the love.

270
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,553
So I wonder if he can step forward.

271
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,789
There's so much going on.

272
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,424
Yeah.

273
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,726
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

274
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,295
Cheers!

275
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,230
It smells good.

276
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,166
-Delicious.
-Yes.

277
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,168
What's your type?

278
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,169
My type?

279
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,073
Someone with a kind face

280
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,510
but with a meaty body, I guess.

281
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,914
Simply speaking, I like big butts.

282
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,951
-That means…
-Usak.

283
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,585
-Sak-sak.
-And Taeheon.

284
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,087
-Yeah, Taeheon too.
-His is big.

285
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,755
-Mine is small.
-No.

286
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,725
Buttocks get bigger
if you work hard together.

287
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,695
-So the possibilities are endless.
-Grill, please.

288
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,929
Grill the meat, please.

289
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:04,997
All right.

290
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,000
What made you join us?

291
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,538
It takes me a long time
to get into a serious relationship.

292
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,607
Having a boyfriend is a big deal to me.

293
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,410
But I'm 29 now.

294
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:24,350
I don't want to prejudge
what I can or can't do.

295
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,854
I thought I could have experiences
and feelings I'd never had before.

296
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,856
That's why I came.

297
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,825
Bravo! Amazing!

298
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,828
Thank you for joining us.

299
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,363
The sound of the applause

300
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,264
really resonates here.

301
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,003
He's been through a lot.

302
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,705
He seemed shallow on first impression,
so his words now…

303
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,707
He's becoming a lot more likable.

304
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,310
So I think self-love is important.

305
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,612
I seriously believe
self-love is important.

306
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,616
But I'm afraid
of becoming self-centered too.

307
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,252
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic,

308
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,789
I think many people
complained about the government,

309
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,591
including my family.

310
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,029
But what can we do without the government?

311
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:14,166
We shouldn't place blame on others.
Instead, do what you can.

312
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,270
Get to the point
where you don't need them.

313
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,408
Expressing our ego
doesn't mean being selfish.

314
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,309
"This is what we need."

315
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,612
"This is what we're asking for."

316
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,814
Society won't change if we don't speak up.

317
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,884
Isn't it too difficult to change society?

318
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,185
But it should change.

319
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,822
Water gets stagnant if it doesn't flow.

320
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,223
Change is necessary.

321
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,926
The flow of water is what keeps it clean.

322
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,563
Our current society
benefits the mainstream.

323
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,967
But thinking that way
is disrespectful to mainstream people.

324
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,869
It's not about being disrespectful.

325
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,840
When you benefit, you may not
even realize that you're privileged.

326
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,810
You may think that,

327
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:02,414
but through the media,
I can tell mainstream people

328
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,386
are becoming more considerate
of LGBTQ people lately.

329
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,021
No, I don't think that--

330
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,024
-So that's your viewpoint, Dai.
-Right.

331
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,930
In the end, the stronger your belief,
grasp, and embodiment of it,

332
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,133
and the more fervently you cherish
what's important to you,

333
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,635
the more infectious it becomes.
Same as love.

334
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,672
What I truly believe…

335
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,041
When I wake up each morning,

336
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,943
I perceive myself

337
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,179
as someone capable of influencing
the world I am about to encounter.

338
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,417
I choose to believe
that the world I live in is full of love.

339
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,120
It's actually very simple.

340
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,291
And… the meat is cooked just in time!

341
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,131
-Where are the chopsticks?
-Let's eat.

342
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,067
I should've added this rosemary.

343
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,035
-We don't have any.
-Yes, we do.

344
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,604
Huh? Rosemary?

345
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,372
Maybe some oregano.

346
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,611
-I really wish we had added rosemary.
-Yeah, sounds good.

347
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,880
-What happened, Dai?
-That was…

348
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,281
From Dai's standpoint…

349
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,849
He may feel upset.

350
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,819
Pass me your plate, guys. I'll serve you.

351
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,656
So juicy.

352
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,790
It's delicious.

353
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,726
-It's good?
-Yeah. It's good.

354
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,896
High five!

355
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,498
-Is it good?
-Thanks.

356
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,101
-Another beer for me.
-I'm going to the bathroom.

357
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,270
-Nice, Shun.
-Very good.

358
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,038
Very nice. This is important.

359
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,440
Dai will be happy.

360
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,611
Dai.

361
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,013
-Shun?
-Hmm?

362
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,881
I wanted to see you.

363
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,153
I had to calm myself down a bit.

364
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,126
Things happen, right?

365
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,863
I've known Alan for a while.

366
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,332
He always tries to sum things up
nice and neatly.

367
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,366
Alan does?

368
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,904
I don't think life is so neat.

369
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,507
Who cares if it's dirty or messy?

370
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,944
I think it's fine… as long as you're real.

371
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,779
Yeah.

372
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,281
I know.

373
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,622
"How can you know anything when
you haven't experienced any hardship?"

374
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,224
People tend to think that of me.

375
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,995
So when you sit
and listen to me calmly like this,

376
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,763
it makes me want to know you more.

377
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:37,636
I don't know what made you
who you are right now.

378
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:42,341
There must be some reasons.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be you.

379
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,178
You're different from anyone
I've ever met before.

380
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,550
I think you must have experienced
something substantial and heavy,

381
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:56,488
and those times
must have forced you to be strong

382
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,590
and made you who you are right now.

383
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,628
I hope I get to hear about
that part of you someday.

384
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,100
If you really want to hear about that…

385
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,570
I think I could tell you.

386
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,339
How could I not want to?

387
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,442
Like how I grew up?

388
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,377
Yeah.

389
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,150
From the time I was born,

390
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,687
I've been without my parents.

391
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,058
Most likely,

392
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,162
I was abandoned as a baby

393
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,465
at an orphanage.

394
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,737
That's where I was left.

395
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,506
-You were?
-Yes.

396
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,276
Well, I'm not sure since I don't remember.

397
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,216
And I was raised at a children's home
until I was 18 years old.

398
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,618
An orphanage?

399
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,421
Yeah, that kind of place.

400
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,955
Even there…

401
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,193
I went through a lot.

402
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,261
I bet.

403
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,865
I don't know what "family" is

404
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,535
or what familial love is.

405
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,871
I didn't have a normal life.

406
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,142
I grew up without really picking up
what should be common sense.

407
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,079
And…

408
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,114
Well,

409
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,616
after a lot happened,

410
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,989
I ended up coming to Tokyo on my own.

411
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,595
For the past five years
since I've been here in Tokyo,

412
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,897
I've been…

413
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,267
free.

414
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,339
You know?

415
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,808
I can't even imagine.

416
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,981
I'm going to play

417
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
to help calm you.

418
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:06,818
I see.

419
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,720
So…

420
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,655
It's calming

421
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,058
while I play.

422
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,595
You're cute. Are you creating a song now?

423
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,564
Shall we go back to everyone?

424
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,531
Why not.

425
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,700
Did you calm down?

426
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,204
-I'm calm now, thanks to you.
-That's good.

427
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,873
Thanks.

428
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,807
Yeah.

429
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,587
You said earlier
that some people important to you

430
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,556
had passed away.

431
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,327
Can you tell me who they were?

432
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,229
My dad and grandpa.

433
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,831
I thought it might be your dad.
And grandpa too.

434
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,300
-I see.
-Well…

435
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,104
My dad suddenly became ill.

436
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,975
When he couldn't stand it,
he went to the hospital

437
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,310
and was told he had
only three months to live.

438
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,980
It was stomach cancer.

439
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,184
In fact, my dad didn't even make it
a month before he died.

440
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:25,624
In the end, he was unconscious
and unable to think.

441
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,061
But my dad said to me at the end,
"I admire you."

442
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,430
I was…

443
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,034
Oh, it must've been hard for you.

444
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,242
-Do you need this?
-Yeah.

445
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,579
It hasn't even been a year yet.

446
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,385
I hadn't really talked with my dad
since I started working.

447
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,055
I was quite independent.

448
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,958
I started working young

449
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,160
and couldn't go home often.

450
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,298
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't tell my parents what I was doing.

451
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,202
But they still supported me
behind the scenes.

452
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,971
And his last words were,

453
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,007
"I admire you."

454
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,788
You never know what will happen in life.

455
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,760
I want to cherish the present moment

456
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,530
so I won't have regrets.

457
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,468
I'm glad I was able to meet you all.

458
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,175
And then my grandfather passed away too.

459
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:57,148
I thought this might be an opportunity
that my dad had given me.

460
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,651
Yeah.

461
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,587
You know, I think so too.

462
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,858
So… I'm grateful to my dad.

463
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:18,737
Everyone has come here with
their own backstories and experiences.

464
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,338
When we see that side of them…

465
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,473
You know?

466
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,407
It's true.

467
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,411
It's difficult to open up
about yourself in the beginning,

468
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,613
especially about weaknesses
or what's precious.

469
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,517
But as they gradually become friends
and develop feelings for each other,

470
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,587
they feel secure enough
to open up to each other.

471
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,290
When a side of Gensei
or Shun we don't know comes out,

472
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,059
we realize the others,

473
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,996
like Usak, Kazuto, and Taeheon,
must all have those sides too.

474
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,732
-Everyone has their own experiences.
-Of course.

475
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,870
For now, this has helped Shun and Dai

476
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,373
to really connect emotionally.

477
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,010
It felt like they were just themselves.

478
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,945
That scene with the piano.

479
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,014
-It was a gentle moment.
-It was so nice!

480
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,317
It was so beautiful, wasn't it?

481
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,919
It was like a movie.

482
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,321
Yes, it was like a film poster.

483
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,258
There was even space for a title.

484
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,493
-It's backlit too.
-Wong Kar-wai-style.

485
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,496
Wasn't it lovely how Dai approached him?

486
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:22,967
The way he asked Shun
why he's the way he is.

487
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,436
I liked how Dai did that.

488
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,939
Shun was like, "I know."

489
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,709
-I thought it was nice.
-A lot happened.

490
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,477
Their bond has grown stronger.

491
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,345
-Yeah, quite strong.
-Very much.

492
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,716
Isn't it awkward
to borrow money from friends?

493
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,118
-I couldn't.
-When money is involved…

494
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,219
Not with friends.

495
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,587
Is this condensation?

496
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,089
It's so wet.

497
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,225
You may see their desperation…

498
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,693
-It rang.
-We got a message.

499
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,061
Something rang.

500
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,629
What?

501
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,765
-"This is a notice for you."
-Wanna eat this?

502
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,033
-I want bread.
-Okay.

503
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,401
What?

504
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,169
What is it?

505
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,938
-What?
-Come on.

506
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,975
"Tomorrow, two of you
will go on a private date."

507
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,778
That was the message?

508
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,046
That's how it goes?

509
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,581
-That's great!
-That was sudden.

510
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,750
-Out of the blue?
-Okay.

511
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,321
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on paper."

512
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,757
-Insane.
-We can all write a name?

513
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,492
-Probably.
-Wow!

514
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,392
What?

515
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,395
-I really wanted to go to Disneyland.
-Hey, listen.

516
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:30,735
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings are mutual."

517
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,238
Maybe I'll write my own name.

518
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,606
Your own?

519
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,077
"The announcement will be made
tomorrow morning."

520
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,145
Do you like this?

521
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,013
I love it!

522
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,882
This was way too sudden.

523
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,617
But it is really exciting.

524
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,620
They're finally going to reveal
their true feelings.

525
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,988
Could be reciprocal love.

526
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,957
After opening up, they must be
seeing things differently, right?

527
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,125
Right.

528
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,257
I guess Dai and Shun are solid, right?

529
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,491
Dai and Shun, yeah.

530
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,694
If they aren't matched,
I'll be like, "What?"

531
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,129
Yeah, it wouldn't make sense otherwise.

532
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,165
I hope they end up together.

533
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,739
"Tomorrow, two of you will go
on a private date."

534
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,979
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on paper."

535
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:29,954
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings are mutual."

536
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,994
Please read it, Usak.

537
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,895
Okay.

538
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,464
"Good morning."

539
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,965
Good morning.

540
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,369
"We will announce the pairs
who can go on a private date."

541
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,771
It's very sudden.

542
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,139
Wow.

543
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,442
-I don't want to do this part.
-Agreed.

544
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,845
I'm feeling so antsy.

545
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,079
The first pair is…

546
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,083
Shun.

547
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,623
Okay.

548
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,824
My stomach hurts.

549
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,459
Shun knows who it is, right?

550
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,694
Yeah.

551
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,930
-Lucky!
-That's right. You'd know.

552
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,567
Then Shun's partner is…

553
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,745
-Who?
-Dai.

554
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,080
Thank goodness!

555
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,917
THE FIRST PAIR
SHUN AND DAI

556
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,452
I'm relieved.

557
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,553
Congrats!

558
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,223
Oh yeah. That was obvious, of course.

559
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,459
Usak took a long pause.

560
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,927
Yay.

561
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,298
It was just as expected.

562
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,335
I knew Shun would write Dai.

563
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:55,006
Seeing Shun, I sensed that Shun liked Dai

564
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,742
or that he might have fallen for him.

565
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,579
You said, "The first pair."
That means there's a second pair?

566
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,880
Okay, I'm going to tap it.

567
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,782
I'm curious about the second pair.

568
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:13,591
I chose Ryota because
I've always wanted to talk with him.

569
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,365
I wrote Usak's name.

570
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,900
The reason is that I find him unexpected.

571
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:27,071
When I saw Usak eating ice cream,
I thought it was cute.

572
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,513
"That is all."

573
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:38,950
That's all?

574
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,218
Is that what it says?

575
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,786
That's what it says.

576
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,523
Did I misunderstand?

577
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,727
Is it possible he wasn't interested in me
to begin with?

578
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,628
Or no?

579
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,298
Was it all just in my mind?

580
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,934
Is that what it was?

581
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,873
Gensei wrote Ryota's name,

582
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,441
but he ended up like, "What?"

583
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:08,312
"If he didn't write my name,
did I misunderstand?"

584
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,647
That's what happened.

585
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,182
I wonder which way he'll go.

586
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,017
Will he give up?

587
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,654
Or will he realize
he actually likes Ryota?

588
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,689
I wonder.

589
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,291
-Have fun.
-Are we saying bye?

590
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,626
-Yep. Have fun.
-See you.

591
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,827
-Have fun.
-See you, guys.

592
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,062
Have fun.

593
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,863
How nice.

594
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,333
They must be excited.
It's kind of exciting for us too.

595
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,636
They're cute.

596
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,311
I'm happy to know
that you wanted to go on a date with me.

597
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,514
Well, I don't have any other options.

598
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,885
Hey, you could've just said,
"I wanted to go out with you."

599
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,254
YOKOHAMA CHINATOWN
FUKUMANEN

600
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,322
Let's eat.

601
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,594
I was thinking about this
in the bath yesterday.

602
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,530
I was thinking how you're not very good

603
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,200
at showing your emotions.

604
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,768
-You know?
-Am I?

605
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,903
I often thought that at first.

606
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,539
I wasn't interested in you then.

607
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,977
Yeah, maybe
you really weren't interested then.

608
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,047
I was getting no reactions from you.

609
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,784
I'm glad that I actually had it wrong.

610
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,689
I came on pretty strong.

611
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,562
Have you never been chased like this?

612
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,533
I have,

613
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,303
but I wasn't interested,
so I just dropped them.

614
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,606
What can you do, right?

615
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,507
Yup.

616
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,311
I don't really like being pursued.

617
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,715
Until we start dating,

618
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,885
I don't care if I'm at level ten
and they're at zero.

619
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,953
-Okay.
-Do you understand?

620
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,489
-I mean our feelings.
-Okay, I get it.

621
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,858
Then it should be 50/50 when we're dating.

622
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,960
So it's flipped now?

623
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,196
Right now, your level is

624
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,632
around eight.

625
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,935
Why do you say that?
That's rather presumptuous.

626
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,638
You don't know
if I'm at level eight or two.

627
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,240
But you're expressing your feelings
more than me.

628
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,475
-That's true.
-Yeah.

629
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,677
I'm not used to it.

630
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,813
I'm not good at this.

631
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,887
-I think they balance each other.
-Yeah, a nice date.

632
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,255
Dai can joke with him more.

633
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,225
Yes, they're building a good relationship.

634
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,196
It's been a while
since I've been to an aquarium.

635
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,365
I wonder what this one is doing now.

636
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,303
I've never seen a fish like this.

637
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,405
-It's hiding.
-Amazing.

638
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,540
-Look, there are sharks.
-Wow.

639
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:51,809
That's huge.

640
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,779
This kind of aquarium is fun, isn't it?

641
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,081
-It's so fun.
-Their relationship.

642
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,517
Glancing at each other's reflections
in the glass.

643
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,885
I know what you mean.

644
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,153
So cute!

645
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,689
I wonder if they're swimming hard.

646
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,557
They're swimming!

647
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,292
They're adorable!

648
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,428
They're coming! So cute!

649
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,863
They're playing together.

650
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,335
What? Is that one alive? It's super cute.

651
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,903
Isn't it cute?

652
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,906
I wonder if it's full.

653
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:24,909
Yeah, cute.

654
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,778
Look at them.

655
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,114
Oh, it's moving!

656
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,116
Cute.

657
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,851
They're super cute!

658
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,954
I wanna take photos.

659
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,294
Is it good? Yummy?

660
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,496
Yummy?

661
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,265
So cute.

662
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,141
You wrote my name on the paper,

663
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,511
put it in the bin, and now we're here.

664
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,447
That's something meaningful to me.

665
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,918
If you still feel the same
about me after this,

666
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,887
it doesn't have to be obvious,

667
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:15,926
but it would make me happy
if you were open about your feelings.

668
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:17,928
Like today.

669
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,098
I was so happy.

670
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,433
I see.

671
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,669
Of course. It's obvious.

672
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,138
Of course that would make me happy.

673
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,008
My heart feels really full right now.

674
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,877
-Really?
-Yeah.

675
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,545
I feel happy.

676
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,751
You're very important to me.

677
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,555
Thank you.

678
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,590
"Thank you"?

679
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,092
That's it?

680
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,336
What is it? What are you doing now?

681
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,805
I'm thinking.

682
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,106
Were you?

683
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,342
About what?

684
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,244
-You know what?
-Yeah.

685
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,047
Well…

686
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,516
-Tell me.
-No.

687
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,085
You said, "You know what?"

688
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,388
What?

689
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,232
I saw some bad aspects of him.

690
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,402
It threw cold water on my feelings.

691
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,804
What?

692
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,473
-What?
-Why?

693
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,274
-When did that happen?
-When?

694
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,509
Hey, Shun!

695
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,610
What's the issue?

696
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,645
Let me watch the next ten minutes.

697
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,514
-I know, right?
-Seriously.
