00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,567
Why do I keep having these dreams?

14
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:22,190
Professor, this part of the brain
looks a little strange.

15
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,567
Your body is still recovering.

Do it. Stab him.

Are you okay? Does it hurt?

24
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:11,343
Of course it hurts! What a dumb question.

25
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,008
You can't just show up without calling.

What are you doing here so late?

31
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,183
Why didn't you call first?

32
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,363
You have my number, don't you?

33
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,016
I saw you walking around your house
earlier this evening.

34
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,636
Then you disappeared. I...

35
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:58,436
I was worried.

36
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,536
I rang the doorbell a bunch of times.
Didn't you hear it?

37
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,976
Why are you stalking me?

38
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:12,263
- Are you some kind of psycho?
- What?

39
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:17,514
I saw your photo
in that lawyer Patthapol's room.

40
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:22,234
It made me suspicious-- Ouch!

41
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,303
Go on.

42
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:28,683
I was afraid you might be connected
to the victims who were strangled.

43
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,676
So you think he's coming after me?

44
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,843
And how do you know he's the killer?

45
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,835
It's a gut feeling.

46
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh, not the gut feeling again.

47
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,023
It's just your imagination.

48
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:57,343
You have no evidence. It's all in your head.

49
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,528
- Let me ask you something.
- Mmm.

50
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:07,434
Why can't your team... catch this killer?

51
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,320
What's really going on?

52
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,110
Is there...

53
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,883
something going on behind the scenes...

54
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,443
that's making this a mess?

55
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,891
Behind the scenes...

56
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,396
Every time we get close to a lead,

57
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:34,616
something happens that stops us
from catching the killer.

58
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:40,003
Sometimes, we even get an order
to drop the case.

59
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,903
I just thought you guys
weren't trying that hard.

60
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,316
It's just one failure after another.
Who knows why.

61
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,103
Hey, stay still.

62
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:57,463
You're a cop. Have some pain tolerance.

63
00:07:57,463 --> 00:08:00,703
Stop doing that. It's almost done.

64
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:03,403
There.

65
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,981
Thanks.

66
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,176
We've really tried everything.

67
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:17,336
Every possible way. But we've never succeeded.

68
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,130
If there really is a cover-up like I suspect,

69
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,483
it won't matter how good you are.

70
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,410
You'll never catch him

71
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,963
if someone's protecting him.

72
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,476
Anyway, you're done here. Go home.

73

74
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,203
Your mouth will be bleeding, too.

76
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,316
Try turning on the light.

77
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,316
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

78
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,599
It's on! Thanks, man!

79
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:11,243
Thanks, man. Come on down.

80
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,690
- Thanks.
- Hold on...

81
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:29,174
- Go sell these.
- Thanks.

82
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:31,478
Come back next time.
I'll keep saving them for you.

83
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,363
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

84
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,491
What's all that noise?

85
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,336

86
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,479
Teep!

87
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:55,025
How many times have I told you
to stop causing trouble?

88
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:59,556
- What trouble?
- Get inside. How many times do I have to say it?

89
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,670
He's my friend!

90
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,183
Why did you bring him into the house?

91
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:06,019
Inside? He's just at the front door!

92
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,837
He's an ex-convict, don't you remember?

93
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:11,336
Come on, he's a changed man.

94
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:14,808
I don't believe it! Are the cops on their way?

95
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:18,607
Why would they be? He was released.
They'd just check on him, not arrest him!

96
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:21,241
I don't believe it!
Stop bringing trash into our home!

97
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:23,007
And stop trying to be such a saint!

98
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,961
Try to see the good in people for once!

99
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,407
You just assume everyone's bad!

100
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,527
Was he ever a good person?

101
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,527
- Well, he--
- He ended up in jail, didn't he?

102
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:36,688
Just because he was in jail
doesn't mean he's still a bad person!

103
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,647
Don't pick a fight with me.
I don't want the kids hearing it.

104
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,037
You never listen to me!

105
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:42,808
You're always bringing trouble home!

106
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,367
It's just one thing after another!

107
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,361
What about all the good things I do?

108
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,735
You never mention those.

109
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,448
But I make one tiny mistake,
and you're all over me.

110
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,523
And this isn't even a bad thing!

111
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:55,546
It's just helping someone out!

112
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,270
Hey, calm down. I-I'm not going to hurt you.

113
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,803
Let me go!

114
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,856
Help!

115
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,697
Get out of the way!

116
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,343
Wait!

117
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,110
I-I-I'm sorry.

118
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:33,989
What's the occasion?

119
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:37,030
Happy anniversary!

120
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,276
It's been two years.

121
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,076
Two years already?

122
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:43,584
Time flies, huh?

123
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,384
Isn't the cake cute?

124
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,403
Hey, wait...

125
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,203
Not yet.

126
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,196
Steak first.

127
00:12:58,196 --> 00:12:59,596
Did you make this yourself?

128
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,496
What do you think?

129
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,203
I bought it from the shop on the corner.

130
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,396
- Really?
- Yep.

131
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,236
So, is it good?

132
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,043
It's great!

133
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:20,237
I'll cook for you next time.
I can make something way better.

134
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:22,176
When's "next time"?

135
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,415
How about next week?

136
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:30,877
Next week it is.

137
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,537
It's delicious.

138
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,342
See?

139
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,142
Our baby.

140
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:50,856
I see it.

141
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:55,036
So is it a boy or a girl?

142
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,210
I can't tell yet.

143
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:02,516
But whether it's a boy or a girl,
I'll love them all the same.

144
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:04,997
What about you?

145
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,957
A boy or a girl?

146
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,196
I want a girl.

147
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,997
How come?

148
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,477
So she can be adorable like me.

149
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,117
What is it?

150
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,597
Let's pick a name for the baby.

151
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:33,944
Isn't it a bit early?

152
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,464
We can just pick one out first.

153
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,116
Kawinchaya.

154
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,335
Kawinchaya...

155
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,787
After this, let's make a plan together.

156
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:07,507
You have to take care of yourself, too.

157
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:16,597
You're taking care of two people now.

158
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,516
You too, okay?

159
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,996
I don't know what's really going on.

160
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:49,066
There are so many unanswered questions.

161
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:57,756
But no matter what,
I'll help you find the answers.

162
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,677
Dr. Kankavin has passed away.

163
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:31,556
I received your email,
but I couldn't open the file.

164
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:35,917
If you'd like me to run this story,

165
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:42,236
please send me the password.

166
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:08,863
Go on.

167
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:11,643
Do it.

168
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,556
- Do it.
- Hey!

169
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,997
Do what you love to do.

170
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,797
Wit.

171
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,396
Go on.

172
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,717
Do it.

173
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,237
Do it just like you love to.

174
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:53,396
Picha.

175
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:55,196
Are you okay?

176
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:04,416
Come on, let's go inside.

177
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,177
Let's get something to eat.

178
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,676
You're safe now.

179
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:42,636
Sang, come on in. I've got this ready for you.

180
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:45,686
Here, you can take the paper and the bottles.

181
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,037
The bottles, too.

182
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:55,383

hire an ex-convict?

about that when you committed your crime.

Today, the Meteorological Department
has issued a heavy rainfall warning.

238
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:21,326
This is due to a strong southwest monsoon
covering the entire Maga One City area.

239
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:27,730
Additionally, a low-pressure area
is shifting and spreading across the region.

240
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,156
This low-pressure area is expected
to move south toward the Gulf of Maga One.

241
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:36,526
As a result, Maga One City
can expect heavy downpours.

340
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:45,075
was found gruesomely hanging from a floodgate.

of the ex-convictvict,

of a girl under 13,

00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:56,954

to commit the same crime again.

and he's still causing trouble
now that he's dead.

doing about it?

through Parliament.

No more criminals.

370

And maybe then these human rights activists
will finally stop protesting.

You said you'd take care of Picha.

Couldn't you even do that?

and I must have fallen asleep, Captain--

Asleep? How the hell could you fall asleep?

404
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:03,675
I was exhausted, Captain. I'm really sorry.

405
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:07,035
When I woke up and she was gone,
I was about to go look for her.

406
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:11,114
But then her friend called
and told me she was hurt.

407

I swear, I didn't mean for this to happen.

408
00:50:18,954 --> 00:50:21,074
Picha didn't kill him.

409
00:50:22,274 --> 00:50:25,274
There's no way she could have done it alone.

410
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:31,406
Then...

411
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,366

Captain.

413
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:49,006
Picha told me she was the one who killed him.

414
00:50:49,006 --> 00:50:51,407
No way, Wit.

415
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:56,620
Whoever did this isn't normal.

416
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,883
It was brutal.

417
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:01,303
This reeks of a psychopath.

didn't you see the body?

- I wasn't at the scene.
- What?

420
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,310

to the hospital to meet her.

an injured person?

Did you see the state of the body?

429
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:51,366
It took two officers just to get him down.

430
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:54,006
And you think a girl her size
could have done that alone?

431
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:56,086
But a witness saw her
at the scene holding a knife--

432

She was unconscious

She's tiny. She could never have dragged him
up there by herself.

Suddenly, someone covered my mouth from behind.

453
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:30,847
I struggled as hard as I could.

454
00:53:30,847 --> 00:53:33,247
Then I ran down to the beach.

455
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:36,247
I think I tripped over something.

00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:42,727
He choked me, kicked me, and punched me.

He was trying to rape me.

459
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:49,607
After that, he hit me really hard,
several times.

460
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:51,406
Then I passed out.

461
00:53:51,406 --> 00:53:54,886
But right before I passed out,
I remember someone else showing up.

The police said the call came from your phone.

467
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,687
I didn't call anyone. How could I have?

Could it have been the other person you saw?

I still haven't gotten my phone back.

473
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:44,407
I asked the rescue team, and they said
they looked everywhere but couldn't find it.

474

It's probably still at the scene.

Captain, maybe it was just a bystander
who saw what was happening.

But it had to be someone

for everything he'd done.

and now they're killing people.

540
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:36,726
Is this some kind of government plan?

541
00:59:36,726 --> 00:59:39,405
How were these prisoners released?

542
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:42,925
To answer that question, we must keep digging.

543
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:45,646
This is Chanya, M News, reporting.

544
00:59:47,365 --> 00:59:50,065
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

545
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:04,345
Thanks... for putting this report together.

546
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:11,485
I don't know how much it'll help Picha,

547
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:15,210
but at least the public knows
that people are pushing back.

548
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,916
And that not everyone agrees with this amnesty.

549
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:23,001
Did Sangchai have any enemies?

550
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,799
He was in prison for years and just got out.

551
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,599
I'm not sure.

552
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:33,314
Or maybe it's a setup?

553
01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:36,414
A plan to let the psychopaths kill each other.

554
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:45,245
Did you...

555
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,206
ever hear what happened to Picha?

556
01:01:08,024 --> 01:01:10,425
- Hello.
- It's okay.

557
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:13,485
How are you?

558
01:01:13,485 --> 01:01:15,897
Are you still in pain?

559
01:01:15,897 --> 01:01:17,697
Not really.

560
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:22,618
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

561
01:01:28,846 --> 01:01:31,326
What really happened that night?

562
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,590
I killed him.

563
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:42,355
I don't believe you.

564
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:47,250
There's no way you could've overpowered him.

565
01:01:57,734 --> 01:02:01,054
They still haven't caught the killer.

566
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:08,325
If the results say I did it,

567
01:02:10,453 --> 01:02:12,933
then I'll accept responsibility.

568
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:17,126
At least I got my revenge.

569
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:21,569
If I have to go to prison for it,

570
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:24,245
I'm not afraid.

571
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:39,751
I'm not going to ask how you feel...

572
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:43,406
about the way he died.

573
01:03:35,528 --> 01:03:38,167
I just talked to Picha.

574
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:41,197
There's no way she's the killer.

575
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,230
I didn't think so, either.

576
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:47,927
So where will you look for clues now?

577
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,721
What did the autopsy on Sangchai say?

578
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,783
The deceased was attacked
in several vital points.

579
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:06,263
He was struck hard on the head,

580
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:11,990
with bruises all over his body
from the assault.

581
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:15,906
But the cause of death...

582
01:04:15,906 --> 01:04:18,345
was having his genitals severed.

583
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,991
Send the full report to my unit.

584
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:26,726
Will do.

585
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:28,526
I'm heading out.

586
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:35,291
Hey, PM's kid.

587
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:38,141
Captain.

588
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:41,246
I don't think the knife found
at the scene belongs to Picha,

589
01:04:41,246 --> 01:04:45,245
the one the witness claimed
she grabbed from the kitchen.

590
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,796
Send it to forensics
for fingerprint and DNA analysis.

591
01:04:48,796 --> 01:04:50,520
When you get the results, send them to me.

592
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,320
Yes, sir.

593
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:55,486
So why didn't we find the knife the first time?

594
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:57,726
I don't know, Captain.

595
01:04:58,606 --> 01:04:59,846
Psychopaths are meticulous.

596
01:04:59,846 --> 01:05:03,407
There's no way he'd leave behind
a weapon or any evidence for us to trace.

597
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:07,207
Do you think the killer
planted the knife there?

598
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:11,184
So even if this clears Picha,

599
01:05:11,184 --> 01:05:13,734
we still haven't caught the killer.

600
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:16,773
That's true.

601
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:20,703
Did you see the Prime Minister's
press conference, Captain?

602
01:05:20,703 --> 01:05:21,767
What about it?

603
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:28,326
The one where he announced
he'd bring back the Psychopath Abortion Bill.

604
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:33,339
The intention was to make the city
free of crime.

605
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:37,965
I think it's a good idea.

606
01:05:37,965 --> 01:05:43,955
They apparently tried to pass this law
30 years ago, but it never went through.

607
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:46,435
Are you following this story?

608
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,410
I saw it on the news.

609
01:05:49,914 --> 01:05:51,834
What about you, Captain?

610
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,014
What's your take on it?

611
01:05:58,813 --> 01:06:01,363
You're acting a little weird today.

612
01:06:19,235 --> 01:06:21,674
- All set?
- All set, Captain.

613
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:28,355
How were these prisoners released?

614
01:06:28,874 --> 01:06:32,314
Hey! Extend the clip to the end.
Why did you stop?

615
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:33,834
I'm not done editing yet.

616
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:35,394
Don't talk back.

617
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:37,814
Extend it and hit playback!

618
01:06:40,115 --> 01:06:41,915
Just a second.

619
01:06:45,514 --> 01:06:46,874
Hello.

620
01:06:46,874 --> 01:06:49,155
Chanya speaking.

621
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:52,834
Are you going to keep pursuing
this amnesty story?

622
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:56,555
If you don't want to be used,

623
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,647
drop this story.

624
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,155
Who is this?

625
01:07:00,155 --> 01:07:01,795
What party are you with?

626
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:04,275
You don't need to know who I am.

627
01:07:06,075 --> 01:07:08,975
Then why are you getting involved in this?

628
01:07:09,595 --> 01:07:12,954
You weren't around when all of this started.

629
01:07:12,954 --> 01:07:15,715
You could never understand.

630
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:17,915
Drop the story.

631
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:25,515
Who was that?

632
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,875
I have no idea.

633
01:08:07,155 --> 01:08:08,955
Here.

634
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:11,475
Thanks.

635
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:13,274
I can eat by myself.

636
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:15,167
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

637
01:08:17,795 --> 01:08:19,794
Careful, it's hot.

638
01:08:25,914 --> 01:08:27,754
Blow on it first.

639
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:39,034
Oh, Captain.

640
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,540
Oh...

641
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,415
thank you.

642
01:08:58,144 --> 01:09:01,444
The police found the weapon
used to kill Sangchai.

643
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,634
It wasn't your knife.

644
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,869
I already told you, I did it.

645
01:09:20,632 --> 01:09:21,675
Wit.

646
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:23,154
Yes?

647
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:25,395
Stay here and look after Picha for now.

648
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:27,154
I'll call you if something comes up.

649
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:29,234
Wait, what about the soy milk?

650
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:31,474
I bought it for you two.

651
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:34,634
Oh, thanks.

652
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,435
Oh, Doctor.

653
01:09:42,435 --> 01:09:43,954
How are you feeling?

654
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:46,194
Still in pain?

655
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:47,954
Not anymore.

656
01:09:47,954 --> 01:09:50,355
Good. Let me take a look at the wound.

657
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:52,715
It's healing nicely.

658
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,874
I'll have a nurse redress it for you.

659
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:56,274
- Okay.
- Alright.

660
01:09:56,274 --> 01:09:59,954
Now, look at this light for me.

661
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:01,834
Okay, follow it.

662
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:06,834
Any headache? Dizziness? Blurry vision?

663
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:07,914
No?

664
01:10:07,914 --> 01:10:10,355
Good. It looks like you're healing up nicely.

665
01:10:10,355 --> 01:10:12,954
Nothing to worry about.

666
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:14,435
And what about you?

667
01:10:14,435 --> 01:10:16,755
How are you feeling?

668
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:20,315
I still get headaches now and then,
but it's nothing serious.

669
01:10:20,315 --> 01:10:21,834
Good.

670
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:24,555
I've called in a new prescription for you.

671
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:26,194
Make sure you take all of it.

672
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,194
I will.

673
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:30,755
We have a follow-up scheduled, right?

674
01:10:30,755 --> 01:10:32,034
Yes, on the 17th of next month.

675
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:33,675
Okay. See you then.

676
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:36,594
- Okay.
- Alright, I'll be on my way then.

677
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:42,515
Wit...

678
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:45,034
Was Dr. Aekpong your surgeon?

679
01:10:49,074 --> 01:10:51,234
Yeah.

680
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:53,474
It was him, Dr. Aekpong.

681
01:10:54,635 --> 01:10:56,834
I don't think so.

682
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:11,275
What do you mean?

683
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:18,074
Well...

684
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:22,443
I was in Dr. Kan's office that day.

685
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:23,954
What?

686
01:11:23,954 --> 01:11:25,154
What were you doing there?

687
01:11:25,154 --> 01:11:26,957
Well...

688
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:29,871
I wanted revenge for my grandmother.

689
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:51,525
Wait... don't tell me you were the one who...

690
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:54,814
No. I didn't do it.

691
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,155
Okay...

692
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:05,674
And... I overheard them talking.

693
01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:11,515
They were going to have another doctor
perform your surgery instead of Dr. Aekpong.

694
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:29,475
What about Wit?

695
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:32,194
I had him wait in the OR.

696
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:35,274
For this case, I only need a surgical assistant
and an anesthesiologist.

697
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:37,094
That will be all.

698
01:12:40,114 --> 01:12:44,435
That doctor seemed older than Dr. Aekpong.

699
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:52,395
If it wasn't Dr. Aekpong, then who was it?

700
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:59,595
Wait, you said he looked older?
Did you see his face?

701
01:12:59,595 --> 01:13:02,794
Only for a second...

702
01:13:04,954 --> 01:13:07,595
But I'm sure it wasn't Dr. Aekpong.

703
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:12,094
Then why didn't anyone tell me about this?

704
01:13:17,914 --> 01:13:19,914
Is it possible...

705
01:13:19,914 --> 01:13:24,595
they brought in a specialist
from outside the hospital to operate on you?

706
01:14:01,194 --> 01:14:02,994
Wit...

707
01:14:20,443 --> 01:14:24,363
We're all just lab mice.

708
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:26,842
Wit!

709
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:29,483
Wit!

710
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:32,082
Nurse!

711
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:33,882
Please, help!

712
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:43,172
Congratulations on the new program.

713
01:14:48,995 --> 01:14:52,762
Kill him.

714
01:14:54,922 --> 01:14:56,842
Do it.

715
01:14:59,803 --> 01:15:01,922
Kill him now.

716
01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:12,813
Wit, get inside. Please.

717
01:15:16,122 --> 01:15:19,922
I'll raise Korn the best I can...

718
01:15:19,922 --> 01:15:22,443
just like I raised Kan.

719
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,363
Kan.

720
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:32,363
Police.
