5
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,800
Scoundrel!

6
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,925
No matter what, Lawyer Patthapol
seems really suspicious to me.

7
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,320
Because he's connected to both cases.

8
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,920
He might even be involved in
Nilla's disappearance as well.

9
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Okay. Then let's get everything ready.

10
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,520
- Don't mess this one up.
- Yes.

11
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,600
What the hell do you want from me?

12
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
Huh?

13
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,360
You're just like me.

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,240
Kill him!

15
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Hey!

16
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Hey!

17
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Hey!

18
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:25,120
Go!

19
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
The reason I'm letting you leave first
is this. Look, Captain.

20
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,680
Because of you, see? All the patients ran away.

21
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Don't get smart with me.

22
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,530
Where's Wit? He didn't pick up my calls.

23
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,760
No idea, really.

24
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,440
I'll take you home, then go back to work.

25
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Yes, sir.

26
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,658
Yes.

27
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,540
You don't have to take me home.

28
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
- What about your bag? You're not taking it?
- You take it.

29
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,440
What the hell? What kind of person is he?

30
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,280
What the hell are you guys doing?

31
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,080
Seriously, don't you ever use your brain?

32
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,680
You said only three of us knew about it.

33
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,360
Good thing the reporters don't know yet.

34
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,100
Someone saw Teacher Khing go into a pub,

35
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,725
get drunk, and leave with Patthapol.

36
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,760
Come on, Chief.

37
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Even if the mission failed,
at least we know he's the killer.

38
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,050
The CCTV is blurry,

39
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,760
and now we can't even confirm
if Patthapol was the one who actually did it.

40
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,080
No camera caught them fighting. Understand?

41
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,200
So that means we don't have any solid evidence
to pin it on him.

42
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
How could it be possible?
There's no camera footage?

43
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,320
Besides,

44
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,440
remember he's a lawyer.

45
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,120
If he wants to sue us,
he could say, "The police set me up,

46
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,520
used the victim to trap me,

47
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,840
and scared me, so I ran away."

48
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
You get what I'm saying?

49
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,440
Do you realize how you look
when you're chasing the criminal?

50
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
You look bloody serious.

51
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Tee!

52
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,725
I told you to stop!

53
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Anyone would be scared.

54
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,300
He can just claim,

55
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,675
"I was hiding to get my bearings,"
and that's the end of it.

56
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,775
Where is Wit?

57
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't know, sir.

58
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,825
- He wasn't with you guys?
- No.

59
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
Where are you going?

60
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,000
What's with all the walking around?

61
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,573
Sorry, sir.

62
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,606
Hey, Wit.

63
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,240
Don't come in here yet.

64
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,026
Chief is very mad now.

65
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,960
Captain,

66
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,760
I've tracked down Patthapol.

67
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
What?

68
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,760
Hey, how could you follow him alone?

69
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
He's a killer.

70
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,560
Where are you now?

71
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
The abandoned stadium,

72
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,680
I'll share the location.

73
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
How did you even get there?

74
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I think I've killed him.

75
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
What?

76
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
But... but I don't know...

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
I-I really don't know...

78
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Wait there, I'm on my way now.

79
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,920
Hey, where are you going again?

80
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Wit just called, he said he killed Patthapol.

81
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,840
How could he kill Patthapol, Captain?

82
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,680
- You can't joke about something like this.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,000
- I'll inform the emergency unit.
- I'll share the location.

84
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,240
- Wit, seriously?
- Hey, hey. Where are you going?

85
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Going to cause trouble again?

86
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,650
Wit called and said he killed Patthapol.

87
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,000
- What?
- Yes, Chief.

88
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,320
I'll go there myself. You want noodles?
I'll get some for you.

89
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,440
Captain.

90
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,300
What's going on?

91
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,440
Tell me everything so I can help you.

92
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,080
Patthapol went back to the condo.

93
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
I wasn't ready to deal with him.

94
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,350
- Hey.
- I'm okay.

95
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,773
I'm not scared of you,

96
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,568
loser.

97
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,080
You only hurt women who can't fight back.

98
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,640
I hate those women.

99
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,440
Why?

100
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,960
Why are all your victims women?

101
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,600
Because I don't like killing men.

102
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
Men are hard to deal with,

103
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,880
and it's exhausting.

104
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,480
But I have killed a man before...

105
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,520
my mom's new husband.

106
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,880
I did it because I felt sorry for him,

107
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,280
for having to live with a slut like my mom.

108
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,555
So you killed your mom, too.

109
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,040
What a stupid reason.

110
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,440
She had an affair,

111
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,240
ditched her husband
and her kid to be with another guy.

112
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,760
She deserved to die!

113
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,280
Deserved to die? You monster!

114
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Keep sticking your nose in my business...

115
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
You're better off dead!

116
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,680
That sounds fun.

117
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,160
Mil, what's going on?

118
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't be afraid.

119
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
That was just self-defense.

120
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,675
He was a killer. If he had resisted,
he would've been shot dead anyway.

121
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,400
Go check inside.

122
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,040
- Let's go.
- Split up and check.

123
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,360
I'll check the CCTV.

124
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,199
There's nothing.

125
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,813
What?

126
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,750
- Nothing here, Ramil.
- Huh?

127
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,575
No body either.

128
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,440
I mean...

129
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,440
But... I've got marks...

130
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
on my neck and wrists.

131
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,160
Are those from last time?

132
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,475
No, sir. They're fresh.

133
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
No cameras around the building,

134
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,920
but there's one in front
owned by the district office.

135
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,440
I already contacted them.
They'll send the footage to our unit.

136
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,925
Okay.

137
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,680
I'll take a video of the area then.

138
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,925
If you notice anything suspicious,
make sure to record it.

139
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,840
How is it?

140
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,825
What do you need?

141
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Just answer me this.

142
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,640
About what?

143
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,560
You...

144
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,375
did my brain surgery, didn't you?

145
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,160
I was in prison.

146
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,960
How could I have performed your surgery?

147
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,025
You're a brain specialist.

148
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:57,450
If not you,
no one else in this country could've done it.

149
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Reasonable.

150
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
Who told you?

151
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,003
[Prof. Dr. Aekpong Aekpitsanubul, Neurologist]

152
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,775
How are your symptoms now?

153
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,975
Headaches.

154
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,040
Any other abnormal symptoms
since the operation?

155
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,440
Any symptoms? Have you had nosebleeds?

156
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,620
And how long has that been going on?

157
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
By saying that,

158
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,610
you admit it.

159
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,480
You were the one who operated on me.

160
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,206
You're important.

161
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,551
I can't let you die.

162
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,360
What do you mean?

163
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,725
No father would let his son die.

164
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,920
What did you say?

165
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,750
You're lying!

166
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm your dad.

167
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,800
No,

168
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,080
my dad already passed away.

169
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,840
Your fake father is the one who died.

170
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,160
So... you're saying my mom lied to me?

171
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,640
Soontree is not your mom,

172
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,040
your mom's name is Jirawan.

173
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,240
You're saying...

174
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,440
I'm... your son... with a woman named Jirawan?

175
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,680
Why else would I risk everything
to operate on you?

176
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,500
That's not true!

177
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,600
Dr. Kan is your son.

178
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
You saw your son was dying, didn't you?

179
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,480
So you transplanted your son's brain...
into me.

180
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,120
You kept your son alive

181
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,875
to haunt me like this, didn't you?

182
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,760
You might not believe it today.

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,910
Yes, how can I help you?

364
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,760
Uh, I have something to ask you.

365
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,560
What's it about?

366
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,175
Before I ask, please answer honestly.

367
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,600
I would if I could.

368
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,400
Are you my mom?

369
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,600
No.

370
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,590
I'm not your mom.

371
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,675
But... someone told me... you're my mom.

372
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,125
I'm not your mom...

373
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,720
and I don't know what you're talking about.

374
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,200
I only had one child,
and he has already passed away.

375
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,425
You mean Dr. Kan?

376
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm really sorry.

377
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,750
I just wanted to make sure...

378
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,300
I'm not your son.

379
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,680
Who told you this?

380
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:26,333
Orachun.

381
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,920
He's a killer.

382
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,320
Do you believe him?

383
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,280
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now.

386
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:07,600
- Is it beautiful, Mom?
- Yes, dear. Don't tell me this is me?

387
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,240
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm this pretty?

388
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,466
You're so talented. Keep it up.
What are you drawing this for?

00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:18,050
I'm sending it to the contest on Mother's Day.

390
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:23,050
Wow. Beautiful, son.
I'm going to cook now, okay?

391

Soontree is not your mom,

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,840
your mom's name is Jirawan.

393
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,275
I only had one child,
and he has already passed away.

394
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,800
I want to see you.

395
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,775
Now?

396
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,920
What do you know about me?

397
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,520
What do you mean?

398
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,975
Everything about me.

399
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,425
Send me the location, and I'll go there.

400
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,150
Don't worry. I'll let you know
if anything happens.

401

Thank you.

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,725
You can call me anytime.
I never turn my phone off.

403

Yes.

Sorry, there is no answer at the moment.

Not yet.

408

How's grandma?

409
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,425
Same as usual.

410
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,880
Don't worry about Wit.

411
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,275
He'll come back once he's done with his stuff.

412
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,040
- Okay.
- Bye.

What do you need? Just tell me.

415
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,720
So, who's the liar?

416
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,075
Orachun or Jirawan?

417
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,160
- Who do you think?
- Stop playing around,

418
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,480
you all know the truth. Just tell me.

419
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,720
Calm down.

420
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,880
I went to see Orachun...

421
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,720
to ask if he did my brain surgery,
but he wouldn't tell me.

422
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,450
But I can tell he did my surgery.

423
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,840
But he told me...

424
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,225
that he's my dad.

425
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,600
How could I be his son?

426
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,875
Jirawan and Soontree got pregnant
at the same time.

427
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,640
Doctor.

428
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

429
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,200
Doctor.

430
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,640

Thank you.

432
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,625
I'll inform them myself.

433
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,000
On behalf of the research project,
we sincerely thank you, Ms. Soontree,

434
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,400
for your cooperation in providing the data
and agreeing to the physical examination.

435
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,160
Yes.

436
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,240
The DNA results show your baby
has the psychopathy-related gene.

437
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,080
What?

438
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,749
From this point on, our project is ready...

439
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:12,800
to accommodate all your requests, Ms. Soontree.

440
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,250
Jirawan and Soontree...

441
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,000
decided to keep their children.

442

I'll pass your name to the medical team
in charge of these procedures.

448

Please.

This is Maga One Public Radio.
Coming up: Here is the news

452
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:35,850
regarding the horrifying murder case
of serial killer Dr. Orachun Pitchayawattana.

453
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,240
The court has sentenced him to death.

454
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,050
You've already received the results?

455
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,550
Yes, I did.

456
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,650
What is your decision?

457
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,950
My husband died in an accident.

458
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,275
Personally,

459
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,880
I want to keep the baby to remember him.

460
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,440
But I don't know
how I'm going to raise this child.

461
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,160
Because he has the psychopath gene.

462
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,360
If he grows up and becomes a killer,

463
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,500
what am I supposed to do?

464
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,825
How about keeping them and swapping them?

465
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,160
In case one of our children
turns out to be a killer,

466
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,050
we won't have to feel guilty
about getting rid of him.

467
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,480
You're Jirawan's son
and were raised by Soontree.

468
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,825
Dr. Kan was Soontree and her husband's son.

469
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,360
You said my baby has the psychopath gene.

470
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,560
Can you confirm that my child
will become a killer?

471
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,200
Having the psychopath gene...

472
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,640
doesn't mean your child will become a killer.

473
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,760
It depends on the environment,

474
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,760
brain chemistry,

475
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,325
exposure to violent triggers,

476
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,400
and your parenting.

477
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,800
If you raise him well enough,
he might not turn into a killer.

478
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,640
Give me some time to decide.

479
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,589
So you're saying that...

480
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,303
Orachun told me...

481
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,760
the truth?

482
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,800
You and Dr. Kan... were switched at birth.

483
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,360
And Orachun...

484
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,560
he might know the truth.

485
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,680
That's why he did the surgery for you.

486
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,120
A psychopath like him?

487
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,305
Why would he do that?

488
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,480
The psychopaths still care
about their own flesh and blood.

489
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,560
That's why he helped you.

490
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,480
No father would let his child die.

491
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,200
I'm your son with a woman named Jirawan?

492
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,800
Why else would I risk everything
to operate on you?

493
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,625
What else do you know?

494
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,850
Tell me.

495
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,675
- That's all I know.
- Stop lying!

496
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,400
I know you know more.

497
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,275
Tell me everything.

498
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
Your headaches.

499
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,720
What about them?

500
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,150
Your brain is in conflict
because of the brain surgery.

501
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,200
When the part of your brain
with the killer gene activates,

502
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,750
you start craving an outlet
for your murderous instincts.

503
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,720
You still can't control that part
of your brain.

504
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,320
You must...

505
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,400
follow your instincts.

506
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,520
You like it, don't you?

507
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,480
Go on.

Finally,

511
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,160
you just want to kill.

01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,600
What should I do then?

514
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,920
What should I do?

515
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,353
If you wanna kill,

516
01:04:28,353 --> 01:04:30,153
you must kill.

517
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,880
What?

I'm not Orachun's son.

521

I'm not a killer's son!

522
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,720
I won't kill anyone.

523
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,320
No one can use me anymore!

Even though the patient has woken up
and is somewhat aware,

529
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,480
she still needs to rest most of the time.

530
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,480
From now on, her condition
should gradually get better.

01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,920
I don't know what's going on with my grandma.

544
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,975
Grandma!

545
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:17,125
Grandma!

546
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,500
Wit!

547
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,160
That sounds fun.

548
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,160
The patient is safe now,
just high blood pressure.

549
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,680
But it's back to normal now,
nothing to worry about.

550
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,040
What happened to my grandma, Doctor?

551
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,480
This is normal for a patient
who has just regained consciousness.

552
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,400
But there's nothing to worry about.

553
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,480
At this point, we need to wait
for the patient to recover further.

554
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,280
Excuse me.

555
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,800
You're here.

556
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:22,325
What is this place?

557
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:28,575
You did all this,

558
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,840
didn't you?

559
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,600
Why did you kill those people?

560
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,925
No,

561
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,975
if you want to kill them, just do it.

562
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,120
Why keep haunting me?

563
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,400
Just die!

564
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,880
Think about it.

565
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:12,100
How could a doctor go around killing people?

566
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,475
A doctor has to save lives.

567
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,000
Just admit it.

568
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,720
How angry you've been.

569
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,240
Let the good be truly good.

570
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,360
Let the wicked be utterly wicked.

571
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,640
I'm not like anyone else.

572
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,680
That's why I'm hated and punished, right?

573
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,400
Hey, Karan!

574
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Every single wound inflicted.

575
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,000
This person didn't hesitate for a second.

576
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,920
Each stab was precise,
a single strike was enough to kill.

577
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,120
All of this...

578
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,400
is the work of a single killer.

579
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,680
If what you're saying turns out to be true,

580
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,600
do you even realize what would happen?

581
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,680
If you want to stay alive to reveal the truth,

582
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,880
you don't need to find anything else.

583
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,240
I'm sorry.

584
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,520
I'm so sorry.

585
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,300
Karan.

586
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,760
I really am.
