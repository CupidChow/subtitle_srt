00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,540
Uh, okay then.

182
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:19,830
Hello.

183
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,020
I'm Chanya from M News,
a reporter for the News Deep Dive program.

184
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,740
I interviewed you last time.

185
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,100
Do you remember?

186
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,820
Would it be possible if I could...

187
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,470
Hello, reporter. We're not doing interviews
at the moment.

188
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,820
Oh, okay. Thank you.

189
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,550
Hey, what's up?

190
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,830
Lieutenant Chin.

191
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,700
Where's Captain Ramil working on a case today?

192
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,580
I can't tell you.

193
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,790
If the Captain knows you called,

194
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,500
he'll be mad at me for sure.

195
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:16,620
What if I ask you off the record? Is that okay?

196
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,830
Off the record... Oh, yes.

197
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,493
Where's he going today?

198
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,180
Do you have any updates, Captain?

199
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,260
You don't really keep me updated these days.

200
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,220
So, what did you find out?

201
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,980
Why did the Prime Minister come?

202
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,380
He came to stop us from giving case information
to reporters.

203
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,420
If I ask, will you tell me?

204
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:00,140
Let's get to the point,

205
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,980
what are you doing here today?

206
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,317
Have you ever had any problems
with the prison guard?

207
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,380
- No, I haven't.
- Were you with anyone, or alone?

208
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,590
Where were you on the day of the incident?

209
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,130
I was in my cell that time.

210
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,000
I was just sitting around.

211
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
- Did you see anyone?
- No, I didn't.

212
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,120
- Oh, I was in my cell that time.
- What were you doing?

213
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,300
Oh, I was in the bathroom.

214
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,230
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

215
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,740
No one seemed suspicious on that day.
[Chanya]

216
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,660
The guard was nice and kind.

217
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,470
The last time I saw the guard was
when he came to set up the stage.

218
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,540
Then, I went back to the cell block.

219
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,510
Did anyone go backstage after that?

220
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,330
- No, nobody did.
- No, sir.

221
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,700
Everyone went back to the cell block.

222
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,450
Has Suthee had any problems with anyone?

223
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,690
I don't think he has, except...

224
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,260
Did he have any arguments with anyone?

225
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,780
I've seen Suthee argue with Dr. Orachun, sir.

226
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Orachun?

227
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:26,701
Yes, sir.

228
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,230
Alright.

229
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:47,030
How much do you know about this? Tell me.

230
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,100
What's going on between your friend Suthee
and that bastard Orachun?

231
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:51,859
Uh,

232
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:59,540
from what I've heard directly from him...

233
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:43,100
Why is your food better than theirs?

234
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,620
What kind of privilege do you have?

235
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,660
Do you really think this world's fair?

236
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,350
Why? What are you missing

237
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,980
that makes you want to be equal
with everyone else?

238
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:11,860
Look at this creature,

239
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,900
do you think it's equal to other animals?

240
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,310
Come on!

241
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,260
One wrong move and I'll get you, you bastard.

242
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,220
Suthee always wondered why Orachun
got more privileges than the other prisoners,

243
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,670
and why Orachun had been doing fine
in prison all those 25 years.

244
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,940
He's just a death row inmate.

245
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:05,130
Besides Orachun,

246
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,980
did Suthee have problems with anyone else?

247
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:09,393
I don't think so, Captain.

248
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:12,836
He was also a good fellow at the college.

249
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:18,130
So your friend was brave.
And this gave Orachun the motive to kill him.

250
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,220
Motivation to kill?

251
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:22,390
What do you mean, Captain?

252
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,830
Are you saying that Orachun killed my friend?

253
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,180
What do you think?

254
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,180
It's not possible, Captain.

255
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,380
Orachun offered to help stop Suthee's bleeding.

256
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,100
The most suspicious one will act neutral.

257
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,640
Remember that.

258
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Uh.

259
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,666
How's it going?

260
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:57,710
The prisoner is ready
for the interrogation, Captain.

261
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,710
This way, please.

262
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,870
Where are you guys?

263
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,980
Better hurry, I'll wait upstairs.

264
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:29,842
Handcuffs?

265
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,380
We don't handcuff good-conduct inmates.

266
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:44,420
He said there was bad blood
between you and the deceased.

267
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:50,825
Just because I used to argue with him before
doesn't mean I'm the killer.

268
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:58,613
No wonder you can't catch the real killer,

269
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:04,020
when you work like this.

270
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,500
So now you're just looking for a scapegoat.

271

Excuse me.

Where's Dr. Watcharin's room?

363
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,150
Dr. Watcharin,

364
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,500
it's Operating Room 3.

- Thank you.
- Yes.

Hello.

00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,500
I'm here to visit Dr. Kankavin.

Please wait a moment.

370
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,620
The doctor went into the emergency room.

371
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,920
It's that way.

372
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,100
Thank you.

- Doc, help my friend now!
- Yes, hurry up!

they tend to commit
repeated violent acts and crimes.

393
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:15,150
They lack empathy and ignore society.

394
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,550
They believe they're the center of the world,
have no compassion for others,

395
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,230
lack a sense of guilt,

396
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,120
and have no self-restraint.

397
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,400
Their behavior becomes more frequent
and increasingly violent.

00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,620
If they're born into a family
that lacks love and proper care.

Sure.

Have you decided yet?

407
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:53,900
What can I help you with?

408
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:58,060

00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,620
The doctor said they want to monitor her
for another two nights.

Well, I just want to know

00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,100
if he said anything before he died.

Thank you, Wit.

- No problems at all, Grandma.
- Good.

00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,260
But has something been bothering her lately?

460
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:37,660
I don't think so. Did you ask her?

461
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,540
She wouldn't tell me.

462
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:42,350
Oh, really?

The exam's coming up soon,
so she's probably stressed about school.

- I don't think it's anything else.
- Alright.

Goodbye.

469
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:23,620
Greetings, the topic of psychopathy
has been widely discussed.

470
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,206
Many people may not know
what "psychopath" means.

471
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:31,340
Today, our special guest speaker
is a world-class researcher,

472
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,940
a renowned expert
who has studied psychopathy for many years,

473
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,820
Dr. Danai Chanruengrong.

474
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,876
Hello.

475
00:58:38,876 --> 00:58:39,976
Hello.

476
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,820
- Thank you so much for joining us on the show.
- Yes.

477
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,460
Today, we'd like you to explain "psychopathy"

478
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,580
in the simplest
and most understandable way, please.

479
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:52,620
Psychopaths are people

480
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:59,540
who exhibit symptoms
of Antisocial Personality Disorder.

481
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:05,500
They typically exhibit
consistent lack of remorse

482
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,393
and lack of self-restraint regarding the safety
of themselves and others.

483
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,820
Who could possibly be a psychopath?

484
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,160
Are you watching News Deep Dive live?

485
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,500
Actually, psychopathy is quite rare.

486
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,980
The chance is only one in a hundred.

487
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,350
But it can be passed down
from parents to children.

488
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,660
What about someone
with a family history of psychopathy?

489
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,780
Could they become a serial killer?

490
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,900
Not at all,

491
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:38,510
research shows that among 100 individuals
with this genetic trait,

492
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:43,000
99 become serial killers,

493
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,140
while one becomes a genius.

494
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,280
So, how can we reduce violence

495
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,560
among people with psychopathic traits?

496
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:01,420
The way children with psychopathic traits
are raised and cared for.

497
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,020
If they are raised well with good care,

498
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:09,460
it can help prevent violence
and reduce symptoms.

499
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,695
I see.

500
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:17,060
The psychosocial environment is crucial
for individuals with this genetic trait,

501
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:21,640
particularly when raised in a broken family.

502
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,340
A cruel society can trigger

503
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:28,120
repeated violent behavior in this group.

504
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:37,866
As I mentioned, a key trait of those
with the psychopathy gene is...

505
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:42,395
a lack of self-control
and a lack of empathy for others.

506
01:00:42,395 --> 01:00:43,649
Oh, come on, dear.

507
01:00:43,649 --> 01:00:46,710
- Callousness and a lack of fear,
- I've made this for you.

508
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:51,260
lack of remorse, and lastly,
disregard for society.

509
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,600
Based on your research,

510
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,380
a bill has been proposed to legalize the abortion
of fetuses with the psychopath gene 25 years ago.

511
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,620
What are your thoughts on that, Doctor?

512
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,140
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.

513
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,060
Hey, let's cut to the commercial now.

514
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,760
- Hm?
- Hey.

515
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,030
- What the hell is going on?
- It's an order for sure.

516
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,990
- Yes.
- What's the order?

517
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,180
It's an order to cut the show.

518
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,050
They just talked about abortion,
then suddenly cut.

519
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,089
Yes, right.

520
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:58,590
That doctor wouldn't answer anything.

521
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,560
He just hemmed and hawed,
like it wasn't a setup.

522
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,420
- You're right.
- This is definitely the government's work.

523
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:15,220

525
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,550
Don't mention the topic of psychopathy on TV.

526
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,150
Both on news and live streaming,

527
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,140
otherwise, our station
will be forced to shut down.

531
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,900
A bit, officer.

532
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,260
You're always drunk,

533
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,090
not just a bit, your face is completely red.

534
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:53,070
It was a party, come on.

535
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,270
- How many bottles?
- Why are you asking this?

536
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,556
I'm here to bail out my worker!

537
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:01,826
- He's been drunk driving. So, he's your worker.
- Yes.

538
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:04,290
I saw the sign you put up in the community,

539
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:08,260
encouraging people to quit drinking and drugs.
Don't you ever have your worker read it?

540
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,910
Come on. Help me.

541
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,003
- How much would you like to charge?
- That's enough.

542
01:03:14,608 --> 01:03:16,020
No bail needed now.

543
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,780
I'm sending him to court to settle the fine.

544
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,210
Wit.

545
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,870
Take his fingerprints,

546
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,300
then send them to court.

547
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,230
Yes.

548
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,940
I'll get you.

549
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:40,830
Please.

550
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,390
Please, sir.

551
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,540
Are you still mad at me?

552
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,460
I'm sorry.

553
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:04,180
I won't do it again.

554
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,220
I promise.

555
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,860
Is it worth it?

556
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:16,060
We almost got shut down
and lost our license too.

557
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,380
Ryo, we're the media.

558
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,260
We can't just let the public live
in constant worry like this.

559
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,260
It is our responsibility
to deliver accurate information

560
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,140
- to help people understand better, isn't it?
- Yes.

561
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,176
That's enough.

562
01:04:34,176 --> 01:04:36,630
I know, I studied that as well.

563
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:43,430
Great. Next up, we'll have a special feature,
a deep academic dive into psychopathy.

564
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I really want to put this one on air, okay?

565
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:59,260
Hey! No TV broadcast, just online only!

566
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,110
You...

567
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:07,460
The psychopathic killer leaves a message
on the body to communicate something.

568
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,180
Is it enough?

569
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,980
I think the tone is a little too blunt.

570
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,910
Never mind, I'll connect it
with the previous one.

571
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,190
- Okay, I need another run.
- Alright.

572
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,820
Camera, ready?

573
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:24,946
Camera and action!

574
01:05:24,946 --> 01:05:30,986
For the latest psychopathic killer,
the symbol left behind was gold leaf.

575
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,560
Hey.

576
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,780
Hey, what's happening?

577
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:54,340
For the latest psychopathic killer,
the symbol left behind was gold leaf.

578
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,180
The symbol left behind was gold leaf.

579
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,820
The Gold Leaf killer?

580
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,510
Hello.

581
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,750
Doctor.

582
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,580
I believe we should meet.

583
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,190
Sure.

584
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,030
[Chanya]

585
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,230
[Chanya]

586
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,460
I'll go later. Let me get my things first.

587
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,820
Okay, baby.

588
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:46,730
Hey, PM's son.

589
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,900
Captain, we found a new body.

590
01:09:16,378 --> 01:09:21,150
Gold Leaf was left on the body.
What message is he trying to send?

591
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,020
Or could it be referring to the Five Precepts?

592
01:09:35,823 --> 01:09:38,350
So, in conclusion,
the police won't be able to catch the killer?

593
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,540
- What did you just say?
- No.

594
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,150
I'm getting older every day.

595
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,260
You should have someone
walk with you in the rain.

596
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,540
How do you know?

597
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,900
Your son's still alive.

598
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,860
I know who he is.

599
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,500
I'll kill him.

600
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,140
I told you,

601
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,780
someone like you could never kill anyone.

602
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,246
We'll see.

603
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:11,110
All five victims knew you.

604
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,940
So you think it was me.
