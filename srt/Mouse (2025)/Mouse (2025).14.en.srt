Why did you shoot him?

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,950
Do you even have to ask?

3
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:22,765
Dr. Kankawin is dead.

4
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,764
Doctor, the patient is awake.

5
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,725
Every change comes with conflict.

6
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,445
You've never lost anyone,
so you'll never understand.

7
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:53,084
I lost my son because of them.
Why did you let them out?

8

10
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,845
a model police officer for our Maga One City.

11

Nice to meet you.

12
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:19,084
I came back home,
but it doesn't feel like my home.

13
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:20,765
I'm sorry, Grandma.

14
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:23,845
I should've done more to help you.

15

looks strange.

If your family were murdered,
would you still be saying that?

25
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:14,284
We should probably delay the amnesty bill

26
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,164

27
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:18,881
Flip-flopping like this...

28
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:23,041

lose more faith in the Prime Minister.

29

Don't be afraid.

33

The body was stabbed.

34
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,764
Whoever did this isn't normal.

35
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,525
His genitals were severed.

36
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,045
It reminds me of a psychopath.

37
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:57,044
Either way, I've already gotten my revenge.

38
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,004
If I have to go to jail,

39
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,525
I'm not afraid.

performed my brain surgery?

It's because you don't have any friends.

186
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,140
I don't need your pity.

187
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,444
I don't have any friends either.

188
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:58,725
To the wicked, repay with wickedness.

189
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:01,160
All right, students, listen up.

190
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,760
Force and motion of energy.

191
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,039
First, a force in one dimension...

192
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,485
has parallel vectors.

193
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:14,285
They may point in the same direction or in--

194
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:26,004
Hey! Pay attention.

195
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:29,684
And bring that eraser back to me.

196
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,924
Apologize to Teacher Sontaya.

197
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,325
He threw it at me first.

198
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:50,858
Because you weren't paying attention.
You were just staring out the window.

199
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:54,525
But you're the one who taught us,
"To the good, repay with good."

200
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,405
"To the wicked, repay with wickedness."

201
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,845
Return in kind what's done to you.

202
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:02,565
You threw it at me first, so I threw it back.

203
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,325
If you apologize to me,

204
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:08,244
then I'll apologize to you, and we'll be even.

205
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:15,365
Get over here, you little punk!

206
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:22,005
How could you do that to your teacher?

207
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,325
Get up! Get up!

208
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:26,518
Who taught you to act like that?

209
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,924
I'll slap some sense into you!

210
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:30,444
Stop! That's enough already!

211
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:32,045
I said enough!

212
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:33,485
Get in the house, son!

213
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:34,886
- Let go.
- I said let go!

214
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,946
Don't try to stop me.

215
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:42,644
What's so special about your son
that you have to protect him?

216
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,325
He's a psycho. He hurt his teacher!

217
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:27,285
My fish!

218
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:28,725
How could you do this?

219
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:29,964
Isn't hitting me all the time enough for you?

220
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,245
Move.

221
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,805
Mom, you'll get hurt.

222
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:35,765
What is it with all the hitting?

223
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:39,765
- I'll beat you, you little brat. My fish!
- Why do you always have to hit him?

224
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,964
Karun, time to eat.

225
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,001
Karun, come down and eat. Hurry up.

226
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:57,724
Karun, I told you to come down and eat.

227
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,244
Karun!

228
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Honey!

229
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,240
Honey.

230
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,765
Karun isn't in his room!

231
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,765
- Honey?
- Honey.

232
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:19,964
Why are you making such a fuss?

233
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,204
Karun's not in his room!

234
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,520
I just saw him playing out front a moment ago.

235
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:37,684
Karun!

236
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:38,924
- Karun!
- Karun, honey!

237
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,285
Karun, are you in there?

238
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,480
- Karun.
- Karun, open the door.

239
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,160
- Karun!
- Karun, sweetie!

240
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,325
Mom...

241
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:57,005
Karun, sweetie...

242
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,640
Are you hurt?

243
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,960
- Mom...
- Yes?

244
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,600
- Mom...
- Karan...

245
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:05,644
You did this, didn't you?

246
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,005
Mom...

247
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,845
That's it, no dinner for you.

248
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:11,684
Get over here!

249
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,404
I said, get over here!

250
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,725
Come here!

251
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:18,964
What did you do to my son? Huh?

252
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,964
Get in there.

253
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,364
Stay in there.

254
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:29,164
And don't come out!
I'll be back to deal with you later!

255
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,040
Mom,

256
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:29,684
I'm sorry for what I did to my brother.

257
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:32,044
Please don't be mad at me.

258
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,845
It's okay, sweetheart.

259
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:38,265
You're not like other kids...

260
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,484
I don't know why I should blame you.

261
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,605
Because I'm different...

262
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,684
is that why I'm hated...

263
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:51,645
and punished?

264
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:57,285
I'm sorry, sweetie.

265
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:59,605
I'm so sorry.

266
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,565
I'm sorry.

267
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,325
This is where it all began.

268
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:25,285
[Back to the beginning]

269
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:30,005
Sorry, the number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

270
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,204
Sorry, it is not possible--

271
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:39,584
Where are you planning to start
the investigation, Captain?

272
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:48,964
We'll start with Sangchai
and the reason he was killed.

273
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,565
Because ever since Sangchai was murdered,

274
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,924
every prisoner who was released with him

275
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:56,484
has been killed, one by one.

276
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:01,845
Well, those guys did a lot of horrible things.

277
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:03,805
If I were one of the victims' relatives,

278
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:05,364
I'd probably hire someone to kill them, too.

279
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:08,540
Whoa, that's brutal, Captain.

280
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:13,565
This killer acts like some kind of movie hero,

281
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,404
only targeting criminals.

282
00:32:15,404 --> 00:32:20,044
If those ex-cons die, people would
probably feel more satisfaction than sympathy.

283
00:32:21,164 --> 00:32:24,924
Maybe whoever's doing this doesn't want them
to go out and commit more crimes,

284
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:27,684
so they just ended their lives.

285
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,444
That's the motive for all the murders.

286
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:42,364
[Judgment]

287
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:46,805
They're setting themselves up as the judge,
deciding who deserves to die.

288
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:49,455
Just like the Gold Leaf Killer did.

289
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,525
What the hell?

290
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:02,204
I said this case is closed. The killer is dead.

291
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,245
Why are you digging it up again?

292
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:07,549
Because I'm starting to think Dr. Kan
might not be the Gold Leaf Killer.

293
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,904
I only thought it was him because
so much of the evidence pointed to him.

294
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:23,641
Most importantly,
the wounds on the victims' bodies.

295
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:28,160
They showed that the killer
had an expert knowledge of human anatomy.

296
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,480
Every single wound showed no hesitation.

297
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,399
Slicing, cutting, slashing...

298
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,444
So I compared them to the murder cases
of the other prisoners.

299
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,204
But in these new cases,

300
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:48,120
every victim was killed
with a single stab to a vital spot.

301
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,761
That can't be a coincidence.

302
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,085
I'm gathering all the related clues
and evidence.

303
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:03,621
There's a possibility that...

304
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,322
all of these murders...

305
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,764
were committed by the same killer.

306
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:18,440
If...

307
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,720
if what you're saying turns out to be true...

308
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,823
do you have any idea what will happen?

309
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:28,444
First, the media is going to tear us apart!

310
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:34,445
Then the higher-ups will come down
on us hard for answers.

311
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,773
But if I arrested...

312
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,092
the wrong guy back then,

313
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:47,405
I have to fix it.

314
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:53,645
I have to clear Dr. Kan's name.

315
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:04,085
Whatever you do, think it through carefully.

316
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,200
Hello, this is Chanya.

317
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,880
Have you read the information I sent?

318
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:44,725
Who are you?

319
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,564
Why did you send me
this classified information?

320
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,004
What did you find?

321
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:52,564
The code you attached to the file...

322
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,218
I used it to access the data.

323
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:58,520
But I only got a portion of it
before a password scan was initiated,

324
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,524
so I had to log out quickly.

325
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,605
It seems they were prepared.

326
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:06,720
That's why they set up a security system.

327
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,520
So this information is classified.

328
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,084
It's not meant for public viewing.

329
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:14,840
That's right.

330
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,845
So the secret research
in the medical science division,

331
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,325
the Psychopathic Abortion Bill,

332
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:22,325
and the Gold Leaf Killer case...

333
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:24,725
How are they all connected?

334
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:27,525
You seem to know everything about this.

335
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:31,044
Can we meet?

336
00:36:31,044 --> 00:36:33,524
I need more information.

337
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,685
It's too dangerous for us to meet right now.

338
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:39,404
They probably know someone accessed the files,

339
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,884
and they could track us down.

340
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,924
So what do we do now?

341
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:51,045
If you want to stay alive to expose this,

342
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,480
stop digging for more information.

343
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,719
Just keep an eye on the people you suspect.

344
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,360
When the time is right, I'll contact you.

345
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,361
Be careful.

346
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:28,165
Even though Ms. Anong is out of her coma,
she can't communicate much.

347
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:31,245
The paralysis will take time to rehabilitate.

348
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:34,326
The chance of her returning to a normal life...

349
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:37,605
is only 50-50.

350
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:42,364
Just having her awake is enough for me.

351
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,924
Well, I'll be leaving now.

352
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,760
Grandma...

353
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,799
Do you miss me?

354
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:07,844
I missed you so much.

355
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:18,285
Please get better soon.

356
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:21,324
I have so much to tell you.

357
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,245
You know, Grandma...

358
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,045
Wit...

359
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:36,225
He's the one who saved you.

360
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:40,044
Grandma...

361
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:42,645
Grandma, what's wrong?

362
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:45,325
Doctor! Doctor!

363
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,825
Something's wrong with my grandma!

364
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:50,125
Nurse, check her oxygen.

365
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,425
Check her blood pressure.

366
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:56,805
Somphol,

367
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:59,884
supporter of the "Don't Drink and Drive"
and anti-drug campaigns.

368
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:04,284
For the past ten years, he's been actively
promoting both in our community.

369
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,724
15 years ago,

370
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:22,605
he killed someone in a drunk driving accident.

371
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:28,565
He avoided jail because the prosecutor
dropped the charges.

372
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:47,374
Somphol's right-hand man
was arrested for drug trafficking...

373
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:51,285
and got a life sentence.

374
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:56,525
And once again, Somphol walked free
because his subordinate took the fall.

375
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,564
And the reason the killer used a scalpel...

376
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:11,325
was to leave a clue...

377
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,525
to point the finger at a doctor.

378
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:36,724
Let go of me!

379
00:41:42,004 --> 00:41:48,714
Help! Somebody help!

380
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,647
Let go of me!

381
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,159
Let go of me!

382
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,520
And what did On-uma do wrong?

383
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,041
She helps women and children
who have been physically and mentally abused.

384
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,359
You act like you've never done it before!

385
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,364
I'll expose everyone
you used to sell yourself to!

386
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:18,484
I'll tell this whole community.

387
00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:21,165
- Hey, everyone--
- Calm down, sir. Calm down.

388
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:22,484
This bitch used to be a hooker.

389
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:26,205
No, no, no...
Can you please start from the beginning?

390
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:29,004
Because I have no idea what's going on.

391
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,564
Don't make me say it.

392
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:32,964
Or do you want me to?

393
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,084
Hey, let's talk first.

394
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:41,165
Alright, you can tell me what happened.

395
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:45,360
Here's the thing. This woman,
before she moved into our community,

396
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,884
she was a bad person.

397
00:42:46,884 --> 00:42:48,524
That whole "good person" act is just a front.

398
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,725
Behind the scenes, she used to
follow pretty girls, young ones,

399
00:42:52,725 --> 00:42:55,645
and take them somewhere. I'm not sure where,

400
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:58,395
but I know it wasn't for anything good.

401
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:29,924
She used to be a prostitute
and a rich man's mistress.

402
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:35,284
She sent young girls to sleep with men
their fathers' age for "scholarship money."

403
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:39,393
Even if that's true,

404
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:42,244
you have no right to judge her.

405
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:41,084
The scales of justice tip
when money is involved, right?

406
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:44,645
No... no, no, no...

407
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:25,444
Judge Nida is a well-respected member
of society.

408
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:27,524
But when money got involved...

409
00:46:27,524 --> 00:46:30,961
Please maintain order. The court has rendered
its verdict. Please be seated.

410
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,920
- Your Honor.
- Please be seated.

411
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,720
For the good of the country, Your Honor.

412
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:47,805
Thank you, Your Honor.

413
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:55,804
Justice vanished into thin air,

414
00:46:57,404 --> 00:47:00,764
and the judge's bank account quietly grew...

415
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,080
with money from an unknown source.

416
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,404
But everyone wants money.

417
00:47:10,404 --> 00:47:13,485
Isn't that what we all work for?

418
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,805
Don't be afraid.

419
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:08,360
What you did was self-defense.

420
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,640
He was a criminal. If he had resisted,
he would've been shot dead anyway.

421
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:23,404
But I still have marks, look. On my neck,

422
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,804
and on my wrists.

423
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,125
Are those from last time, Wit?

424
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,764
N-N-No, sir. They're new, I swear.

425
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:45,264
Go back to the beginning.

426
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,441
Start from there.

427
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:22,524
Captain,

428
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:24,205
I'm following Patthapol.

429
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:26,005
What?

430
00:49:55,004 --> 00:49:56,725
How could you follow him alone?

431
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,725
He's a killer.

432
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:00,444
Where are you now?

433
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:02,564
The abandoned stadium.

434
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,884
I'll send you the location.

435
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,524
How did you even end up there?

436
00:50:14,524 --> 00:50:17,085
I think I killed him.

437
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:47,645
Chuto,

438
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:49,885
head of the rescue unit.

439
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,836
A good man.

440
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,844
He saved many lives.

441
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:13,125
People from car accidents, fires, floods...

442
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:20,324
Hey.

443
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,758
Then why...

444
00:53:57,758 --> 00:54:00,724
Why would someone hurt a good man like him?

445
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:05,520
What no one knows is...

446
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:10,884
that he wasn't the hero
everyone thought he was.

447
00:54:15,725 --> 00:54:18,475
He broke the first precept of Buddhism.

448
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:23,485
He killed someone.

449
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:28,324
He murdered an entire family.

450
00:54:29,285 --> 00:54:31,164
Just like us.

451
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:44,005
How about we swap our babies?

452
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:48,605
That way, if one of them becomes a killer,

453
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:53,204
we won't feel guilty
when we do what has to be done.

454
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:05,084
I'm sorry.

455
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:07,325
I'm so sorry.

456
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:09,164
Karan.

457
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:12,244
I'm sorry.

458
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:17,085
Karan.

459
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:21,284
I'm sorry.

460
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:24,884
I'm sorry.

461
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,364
What the hell is this?

462
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,404
I don't get it.

463
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:10,004
The Psychopathic Abortion Bill,

464
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:11,444
the Gold Leaf Killer,

465
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,884
and this list of names...

466
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:14,685
What is all this?

467
00:58:14,685 --> 00:58:17,585
It's information from a classified source.

468
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,404
So what's the connection?

469
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:24,005
It all seems disconnected.

470
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:29,404
The Psychopathic Abortion Bill
from 27 years ago,

471
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:32,964
the Gold Leaf Killer case from two years ago,

472
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:35,725
and the recent prisoner release policy...

473
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:39,245
they were all government-backed initiatives.

474
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:41,045
So?

475
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,205
27 years ago,

476
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:48,924
the Psychopathic Abortion Bill
was rejected by Parliament.

477
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:53,125
The children who were identified
as having the psychopath gene...

478
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:56,244
one of them became the Gold Leaf Killer.

479
00:58:56,924 --> 00:59:00,805
After that case was closed, the government
rolled out a prisoner release policy.

480
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:05,253
Then, a serial killer emerged,
and the prisoners started killing each other.

481
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:08,444
Now I believe the government
is trying to push...

482
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:13,044
the Psychopathic Abortion Bill once again.

483
00:59:13,044 --> 00:59:15,804
It's all a cycle.

484
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,410
And what does this "OZ"
have to do with any of it?

485
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:24,364
I don't know what it is yet,

486
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:27,634
but I think it might be an organization...

487
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:30,205
within the Department of Medical Sciences

488
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:33,405
that's conducting some kind of research.

489
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:36,564
A secret organization?

490
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:41,284
Come on, this is Thailand.
That kind of crazy stuff doesn't happen here.

491
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:49,645
This report is from
the Department of Medical Sciences.

492
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:54,440
They've been continuously tracking subjects
and running experiments.

493
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,564
From what I saw, it just looked like
a list of names and behavioral logs.

494
00:59:59,564 --> 01:00:03,444
Your theory doesn't seem very solid.

495
01:00:03,444 --> 01:00:06,394
Where did you get this information, anyway?

496
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,725
I only managed to get a portion of the data
because it was locked.

497
01:00:13,725 --> 01:00:16,044
But if I could get all of it,

498
01:00:16,044 --> 01:00:19,284
I'm sure everything would be connected.

499
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,655
You hacked into their system?

500
01:00:23,655 --> 01:00:24,680
What if they find out?

501
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,964
If they come after us, we're all screwed.

502
01:00:27,964 --> 01:00:31,645
Then that means it's classified information,
doesn't it?

503
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:37,525
Who's your source? How reliable are they?

504
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:43,125
I've never seen his face.

505
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:44,364
We've only spoken on the phone.

506
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:46,081
Oh, that's just great.

507
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:50,645
An unconfirmed source. What if it's fake news?

508
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:57,125
So, this stuff you showed me,
what are you planning to do with it?

509
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:02,685
Stop. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

510
01:01:02,685 --> 01:01:04,377
Get out.

511
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:06,257
I have work to do.

512
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,664
Go.

513
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:26,972
What's up?

514
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:34,764
Is it important?

515
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:42,005
Okay.

516
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:48,772
I've found some evidence...

517
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,238
that's made me think...

518
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:55,386
the Gold Leaf Killer...

519
01:01:55,386 --> 01:01:59,804
and the person killing the released
prisoners might be the same person.

520
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:06,185
Even though the method has changed...

521
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:09,444
the motive for the killings is still the same.

522
01:02:09,444 --> 01:02:13,364
Only this time,
the killer is targeting bad guys.

523
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,284
How sure are you?

524
01:02:21,524 --> 01:02:24,574
Back then, you were so sure about Kan's case.

525
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:29,964
Assuming the son of a killer
would automatically become a killer...

526
01:02:29,964 --> 01:02:32,204
that's not fair.

527
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,444
I admit, at the time...

528
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:48,204
I let my bias cloud my judgment.

529
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:52,645
And with all the evidence pointing to him,

530
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:57,764
I didn't see that something was wrong.

531
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:03,085
If you want to fix what you did,

532
01:03:06,004 --> 01:03:08,765
then you have to find the truth.

533
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:11,804
Find out who's really behind all of this.

534
01:03:16,805 --> 01:03:20,284
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

535
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:28,164
You should eat something and get some rest.

536
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:46,017
Rashen was a good man.

537
01:03:46,017 --> 01:03:48,564
He never hurt anyone.

538
01:03:48,564 --> 01:03:50,564
He never broke any of the precepts.

539
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:52,744
He had nothing to hide.

540
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:58,725
Come on, say it!

541
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:00,924
Say it, Rashen! Please!

542
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,884
- I'm begging you!
- Confess.

543
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:06,765
Confess how angry you've been,

544
01:04:06,765 --> 01:04:08,484
how vengeful,

545
01:04:08,484 --> 01:04:12,605
and how you've never forgiven
what happened to you for a single second.

546
01:04:12,605 --> 01:04:14,404
Tell him, Rashen...

547
01:04:14,404 --> 01:04:17,645
Just tell him!

548
01:04:19,325 --> 01:04:21,125
Thank you...

549
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,725
for believing in me.

550
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,565
No... No!

551
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:38,804
- Rashen! Rashen!
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

552
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,925
What about Suthee?

553
01:05:42,364 --> 01:05:44,841
He was a good guy.

554
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:47,724
All his friends loved him back in school.

555
01:05:48,884 --> 01:05:50,920
It was all an act.

556
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,197
Everything he did was for himself.

557
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:10,284
You got a problem? Come here.

558
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:20,444
Wit, don't get involved.

559
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,324
Don't be a coward.

560
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:32,245
My friends and I saw them playing basketball,

561
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:34,564
so we asked if we could join in.

562
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:38,285
But they said just playing wasn't any fun,

563
01:07:38,285 --> 01:07:40,524
so they dared us to bet on the game.

564
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:43,760
Hey, you're the ones who suggested the bet.

565
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,360
Then, when you lost,
you started a fight with us.

566
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,160
Who started it?

567
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,720
He did.

568
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,145
Hey.

569
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:57,645
What about you punching Kom first?

570
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:00,164
Stop!

571
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:07,884
Go back to your place.

572
01:08:12,324 --> 01:08:14,365
I'm telling my dad.

573
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:15,485
You're going to be in big trouble.

574
01:08:15,485 --> 01:08:19,565
Neung, it's not your place
to go running to your father.

575
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:23,004
I am investigating this
to find out what really happened.

576
01:08:23,004 --> 01:08:27,805
Then I will inform your parents.

577
01:08:27,805 --> 01:08:30,805
Don't try to use your father to pressure me.

578
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:34,725
But a lot of my friends got seriously hurt.

579
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:36,445
Everyone got hurt.

580
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,685
What, you think you're the only ones?

581
01:08:38,685 --> 01:08:40,000
You want a piece of me?

582
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,800
Hey!

583
01:08:43,924 --> 01:08:47,024
You're still going at it right in front of me?

584
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:56,084
Nueng, take your friends and wait outside.

585
01:08:59,124 --> 01:09:00,924
Let's go.

586
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:15,685
And you two?

587
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,165
How did you get involved in this?

588
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:25,365
I saw those two getting ganged up on,
so I stepped in to help.

589
01:09:26,324 --> 01:09:30,268
If you saw them fighting,
you should have come and gotten a teacher,

590
01:09:30,268 --> 01:09:32,204
or tried to stop them,

591
01:09:32,204 --> 01:09:34,445
not joined in.

592
01:09:35,725 --> 01:09:39,284
It was my fault, sir.

593
01:09:39,284 --> 01:09:41,844
You should only punish me.

594
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:44,725
Please don't call their parents.

595
01:09:44,725 --> 01:09:47,365
Things escalated because of me.

596
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,685
I know you well.

597
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:55,164
Those two are on scholarships
from the Association.

598
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:57,408
You're trying to take the blame

599
01:09:57,408 --> 01:10:01,328
because you don't want your
friends to get in trouble, is that it?

600
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:05,405
No, sir.

601
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:07,955
I just don't want any more trouble.

602
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:48,645
You guys hurt a bunch of his friends.

603
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,565
He's not going to let this go easily.

604
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:52,565
He thinks his dad is so powerful,

605
01:10:52,565 --> 01:10:55,045
so he acts like he's untouchable.

606
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,561
His father is going to come after us.

607
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:05,884
But anyway, thanks for helping us out.

608
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:11,924
No problem.

609
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:13,724
Sorry.

610
01:11:17,117 --> 01:11:19,898
He can fool everyone else,

611
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:22,414
but he can't fool himself.

612
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:28,244
Why did you go berserk back there?

613
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:30,044
You scared me.

614
01:11:33,565 --> 01:11:35,385
Look at me again.

615
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,124
I don't know.

616
01:11:41,124 --> 01:11:43,044
It just happened.

617
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:48,765
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

618
01:11:48,765 --> 01:11:52,365
For saying I stepped in to help those two.

619
01:11:52,365 --> 01:11:55,284
When I saw you jump in to help them
without a second thought,

620
01:11:55,284 --> 01:11:57,884
I wanted to be like you.

621
01:12:07,605 --> 01:12:09,965
But I want to be like him.

622
01:13:19,164 --> 01:13:20,964
Grandma.

623
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:34,645
It's me, Picha.

624
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:54,845
Grandma.

625
01:13:54,845 --> 01:13:56,645
Wit...

626
01:14:06,324 --> 01:14:08,124
Wit.

627
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:12,685
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

628
01:14:12,685 --> 01:14:14,529
Calm down, Grandma.

629
01:14:14,529 --> 01:14:17,296
Calm down.

630
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:46,936
Why...

631
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:49,416
Why would you want to kill me?

632
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:12,284
Why do you have my picture in your house?

633
01:15:12,284 --> 01:15:14,644
To find a way to stop you.

634
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,605
If you won't stop,

635
01:15:23,605 --> 01:15:25,405
I'll stop you myself.

636
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:29,684
I can't stop anymore.

637
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:37,123
Who...

638
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,110
Who...

639
01:15:42,523 --> 01:15:44,773
Who am I?

640
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:50,000
I am you,

641
01:15:51,094 --> 01:15:53,325
and you are me.

642
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:16,151
Well?

643
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,283
Touching, isn't it?

644
01:17:12,606 --> 01:17:15,013
I...

645
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:22,405
I am the killer.

646
01:17:50,485 --> 01:17:54,325
When money's involved,
the scales of justice tip, right?

647
01:18:10,044 --> 01:18:14,884
Just admit how angry you've been
this whole time.

648
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:19,165
And don't you dare say I was cruel.

649
01:18:54,284 --> 01:18:56,224
I'm sorry, Grandma.

650
01:19:04,004 --> 01:19:05,804
Wit.

651
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:08,844
Wit, is that you?

652
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,605
Grandma... Grandma found the evidence.

653
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:34,325
Evidence of the murder.

654
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:48,684
I didn't have a black button,
so I used a white one instead.

655
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:00,075
Why did it have to be you, Grandma?

656
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:04,665
Why did you have to be the one to find it?

657
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:22,365
I am you, and you are me.

658
01:20:35,485 --> 01:20:37,905
I'm pregnant.

659
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:43,004
Do you think your child will turn out like us?

660
01:20:44,964 --> 01:20:46,485
But the person behind all this

661
01:20:46,485 --> 01:20:49,924
intentionally made
Dr. Kan look like the killer.

662
01:20:49,924 --> 01:20:51,084
Why would they do that?

663
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:54,164
Every piece of evidence points to him.

664
01:20:54,164 --> 01:20:57,514
This isn't the work
of an ordinary person or agency.

665
01:20:58,204 --> 01:21:01,165
Shen, can you really forgive me?
