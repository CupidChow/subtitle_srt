What is it, Captain?

38
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,200
I searched the old evidence documents
of the Gold Leaf Killer

39
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,640
at the Evidence Collection Department.

40
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,040
And I found some evidence
that suddenly appeared.

41
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,320
But some evidence that was there
has gone missing.

42
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
What are they?

43
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,725
The new addition is the CCTV files
from the hospital and the prison,

44
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,440
which confirm that Dr. Kan was actually there.

45
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,663
But the missing evidence is Dr. Kan's contact
information with his friend, Komsan.

46
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:50,120
So you're saying someone switched the evidence?

47
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
When the case is closed,

48
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,080

in case the investigation continues.

50
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,969
The report states it was delivered
on August 20, two years ago,

51
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:19,325
but CCTV evidence confirms
the documents were actually delivered

52
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:24,600
on August 23 of the same year,
three days later.

53
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,280
If so, there would have been enough time

54
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,520
to remove the old evidence
and replace it with the new one.

55
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,040
Who would have the power to do this?

56
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,625
I don't really know.

Did you steal evidence again?

94
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,680
What do you think?

95
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,160
I guess so.

96
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,360

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,760
- Do you see this clip?
- Yes, sir.

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,256
Two seconds are missing from this clip.

This one too.

100
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,120
Hey, this part's missing almost a minute, sir.

101
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,480
Calculate it. If we fill in the missing time,

102
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,160
how long would it be
between walking and running?

103
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes, sir. Wait a moment, please.

104
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,150
On average, humans walk
1.25 to 1.38 meters per second,

105
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,640
and run 7.5 to 8.8 meters per second.

106
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,150
The distance in the CCTV
is about 12 to 15 meters.

107
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,880
Okay.

108
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,720
This part is the time
when Wit followed Patthapol

109
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,200
and killed him before coming back alone.

110
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,720
Suddenly, the body was gone.

111
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,000
It means someone took Patthapol's body.

112
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,143
So what Wit said
about killing Patthapol was true?

113
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,400
We have to find Patthapol's body.

114
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,840
That's the only way we can find the truth.

115
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,560
That means whoever could edit
the footage from this CCTV

116
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,040
must have had access to data
in the Evidence Collection Department.

117
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,700
Either someone in our unit

118
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,200
or someone
in the Evidence Collection Department.

119
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I don't think it's one of us.

120
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Angkan signed as the investigator
on the evidence submission date.

121
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,240
It was already three days late
when submitted. Why?

122
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,320
Exactly.

123
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,775
- PM's son.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,120
Just the two of us know this.

125
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,680
So before we can actually get the evidence,
we need to quietly watch our unit members.

126
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,483
Yes, Captain.

127
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,760
Yes, Captain?

128
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,635
Can I ask you something?

129
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,800
The day before...

130
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,400
Dr. Kan was shot.

131
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880

Just choose one, please?

135
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
I checked the CCTV, but it doesn't show...

136
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,640
it doesn't show you being with Dr. Kan.

137
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Someone made it seem
Dr. Kan wasn't at the hospital,

138
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,475
to frame him as the killer.

139
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,400
At least you're starting to suspect
he wasn't the killer.

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,436
While meeting Kan,

184
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:41,150
they tracked me down.

185
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,520
I should've been dead.

186
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,950
If it weren't for Kan helping at the end.

187
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,960
Kan took me to a safe house, treated me,

188
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,360
and told me to hide.

189
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,320
We discussed the details
and exchanged information.

190
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,425
Everything we discussed
was directly related to him.

191
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,150
He found data related to
the Department of Medical Sciences.

192
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,175
We're about to get that information.

193
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,175
But in the end, I didn't find him,
and I didn't see the information.

194
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,000
Dr. Kankavin has passed away.

195
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,150
Kan passed away,

196
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,280
so I had to hide

197
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,180
and pretend I was dead.

198
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,525
Do you know who's after you?

199
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,720
I don't know.

200
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,280
He's got a hat and a mask on.

201
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,520
Anything suspicious?

202
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,800
Things like his voice, scent,

203
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,120
bracelet, and necklace.

204
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,400
Things that could identify him.

205
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,040
It's the letters "OZ",

206
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,500
tattooed on his wrist.

207
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,240
OZ...

208
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,800
- It's like this?
- That's right.

209
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,975
Have you seen them before?

210
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,900
You talked about the data. What is it?

211
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,100
The government's behind a law
to abort kids with the psychopath gene.

212
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
My police friend investigating this case

213
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,075
found a link to the Gold Leaf Killer.

214
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,430
He found proof that the Gold Leaf Killer case

215
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,125
was twisted to frame Dr. Kan.

216
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,080
I also doubt Dr. Kan's injuries.

217
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,440
They weren't fatal. But then, he suddenly died.

218
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,640
You know who's behind this, right?

219
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,376
It's just my assumption,

220
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:45,325
I think I know.

221
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,550
We've made progress in this case,

222
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,680
so we should move forward.

223
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,480
I think the safe house I'm at
will be secure for a while.

224
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,600
If you get more info,

225
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,250
you can come find me there.

226
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,700
I've planned all my escape routes
in case they catch up.

227
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:10,400
Where is it?

228
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,375
I'll share my location with you.

229
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,700
If it were me,

230
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,425
would you forgive me?

231
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Would you really forgive

232
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,347
me?

233
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,200
Hey.

234
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,475
Say it.

235
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,575
Say it now.

236
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,525
Tell me.

237
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:27,200
How angry are you? How much hatred do you feel?

238
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
And you've never forgiven what happened,
not even for a second?

239
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,160
Say it!

240
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,950
Where have you been?

241
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,775
Are you alright?

242
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,225
Are you okay?

243
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,250
Wit...

244
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,040
Are you alright?

245
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's go home.

246
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Let's go.

247
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,360
Hey! Wit!

248
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,600
Will he survive?

249
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,040
He probably hasn't had enough rest
and hasn't eaten anything either.

250
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,560
I've already given him saline,
vitamins, and supplements.

251
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,360
After resting here for the night,
he can go home tomorrow.

252
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,100
Thanks.

253
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,800
No worries. You can call me anytime
if you need anything.

254
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,200
Did you hear that? He can go home tomorrow.

255
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,850
You should go home and rest, too.

256
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,950
I'll look after him here.

257
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,185
- It's okay.
- Go.

258
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll send him back home tomorrow.

259
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Go, go.

260
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,130
- Okay, I'll leave him to you.
- Okay.

261
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,440
Did Wit know yet?

262
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,180
I called him,

263
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,000
but hadn't even finished talking
before the call got cut off.

264
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,760
I can't get hold of him either.

265
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,975
Picha.

266
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,625
Wit.

267
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
Are you okay?

268
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,040
You don't need to worry about work right now.

269
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,375
Just take care of yourself first.

270
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:52,100
You're not alone anymore.

271
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,375
Thank you so much, Captain.

272
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
I always make you worry.

273
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,175
Something's been off with him lately.

274
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Keep a close eye on him.
Call me if anything happens.

275
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,350
Sure.

276
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:43,350
You too.

277
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,040
You're a mother.

278
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,100
You're going to be a mother,
so you need to take good care of yourself.

279
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,625
Thank you.

280
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,480
What's up, Captain?

281
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,900
Are you at the studio?

282
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,275
Yes, I'm preparing some work.

283
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,050
Can you step out for a minute?

284
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,850
Sure.

285
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,600
Okay, I'll pick you up.

286
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Sir,

287
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm going out for a bit.
Cover things for me, please.

288
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,000
Hey, you.

289
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,825
Hey.

290
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:46,760
Picha.

291
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,120
Wit, you woke up?

292
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,555
Didn't you go to work today?

293
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,875
I just got back.

294
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:59,650
- Can you cut the pork? I'll get rice.
- Okay.

295
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,275
You've been asleep for a while.
You must be really hungry.

296
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,150
A little bit.

297
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,825
Wit,

298
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,950
grandma has woken up.

299
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
Really? That's great.

300
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,800
- And how's grandma doing?
- She just opened her eyes.

301
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
She can't talk or respond yet.

302
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,920
We'll go visit grandma later, okay?

303
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:44,050
Okay.

304
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,760
This is a clip from the CCTV that was cut out.

305
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,775
On the day we went live together,

306
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,080
the hospital timesheet shows that
Dr. Kan is on rounds.

307
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,760
But the CCTV didn't capture him at all,

308
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,960
even though Wit was keeping an eye
on him the whole time.

309
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,640
But the cameras on the opposite side
captured Dr. Kan's car driving out.

310
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,040
And Wit was following him.

311
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,175
And then?

312
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,280
I'm taking you to check out
another incident site.

313
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,925
I'm pregnant.

314
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,960
Do you think our child will turn out like us?

315
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,775
It was my fault...

316
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,120
for overlooking the possibilities at this spot.

317
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,400
No, Shen!

318
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,200
But the person behind this
intended for Dr. Kan to be the murderer.

319
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,250
What was the purpose of doing this?

320
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,175
Psychopath.

321
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,680
Because he's Orachun's son.

322
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,120
All the evidence points to him,

323
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,375
so people easily believe he's the killer.

324
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,640
But I've never believed that he's the one.

325
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,520
The important part is
who had access to the data

326
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,160
and edited or deleted those clips.

327
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,375
It definitely can't be an ordinary person
or organization.

328
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,625
What if it turns out
that someone on your team is involved?

329
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,500
What would you do?

330
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
You trust Dr. Kan.

331
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,080
I trust my team, too.

332
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm going to find the truth.

333
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,200
If you're not going to fix anything,

334
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,200
just jump.

335
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:17,750
Grandma!

336
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,800
Grandma, you know Wit...

337
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,400
Wit.

338
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,600
Grandma.

339
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,000
Okay, Mom. I'll be right back.

340
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,760
What's up?

341
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh, nothing. The PM's son told me
he dropped some case details for me.

342
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,280
- What case?
- Well, the prisoner's case.

343
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,875
Ugh, where did he put it?

344
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,200
Oh, it's here. I found it.

345
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,975
Did he go through my desk?

346
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,530
Grandma!

347
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,550
- Grandma! What's wrong with her?
- Please wait outside.

348
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,425
Grandma!

349
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,800
Grandma!

350
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,760
- What's happening, Wit?
- It's...

351
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,675
Doctor.

352
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,960
- The patient has passed away.
- What?

353
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,240
She just woke up.
How could she have passed away?

354
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,680
- What is it, Doctor?
- Clinically, it's called terminal lucidity.

355
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,580
The patient recovered,

356
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,560
showing an unexpected return
to consciousness before death.

357
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,480
No, that's not it. She was murdered.

358
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,600
- Wait, Wit. Who killed whom?
- Excuse me.

359
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,160
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

360
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,680
Captain, you have to believe me.

361
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,480
I saw someone run out of the room.
So I followed through the car park,

362
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,520

So I followed through the car park,

498

500
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,200
If it's a girl and a boy,
we'll have them get married

501
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,840
and start a family, just like in the movies.

502
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,240
Sounds good?

503
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,960
Then your family can open a homestay
and a shop near me.

504
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,480
What is it?

505
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:54,320

During the show,

514
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,040

Chuto was the first victim.

518
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,950
He was tortured in many ways.

519

What was done to Chuto

521
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,600
was an eye for an eye.

522
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:30,525
Just like Sangchai.

523
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,720
It was the same pattern.

524
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,200

525
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,275
is the same one who killed Sangchai.

526

01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,200
Are you sure it's a friend?

543
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,720
Of course, a friend.

544
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,680
Hey, help me choose one?

545
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,600
Or...

546
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,760
shall we choose for our baby too?

547
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,800
You're crazy, we're not married yet.

548
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,040
Soon.

549
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,040
- We should get married first. Propose to me.
- You want to marry me?

550
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,640
Who doesn't?

551
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,160
Or what about these?
These baby mittens are cute.

552
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:07,480
But... how do we have a baby?

553
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,520
Oh, no, no.

554
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,240
- You sure you don't know?
- Yes, I don't know.

555
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,960
- It's okay.
- I mean...

556
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,100
- I'll teach you.
- Hey!

557
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,560
Really?

558
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,720
No, keep looking. Just kidding.

559
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,680
- So these and this.
- Okay.

560
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,500
- Let's go.
- Okay, go.

561
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,900
Auntie Kunlamas.

562
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,150
Why didn't you call before coming?

563
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,350
Sorry for dropping by suddenly.

564
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,775
I'm here to see Uncle Dumrong.

565
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,800
Is he here?

566
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,000
He died.

567
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,100
He died?

568
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,760
What happened?

569
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,025
A car accident.

570
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,975
Why can't I remember anything?

571
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,840
He died while you were in a coma.

572
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,480
I didn't think you'd remember him,
so I didn't tell you.

573
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,960
I moved here after splitting up
with him a long time ago.

574
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,800
He died while I was in a coma?

575
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,600
Impossible... I saw him just a few days ago.

576
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,040
Uncle Dumrong.

577
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm sure. I remember his face.

578
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,050
Were you there when he died?
You saw his body, right?

579
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,440
I split up with him a long time ago.

580
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,575
I knew because someone told me.

581
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,325
I didn't see him.

582
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,320
Boy, it's after hours.

583
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,720
I told them about the raw material stock.

584
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,960
I said it needs to be reported by Friday
so they can ship the orders out sequentially.

585
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,275
What kind of way is that to work?

586
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,275
Alright, I'll be there.

587
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:52,520
Baby, I need to go back to the office.
Got something to handle.

588
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
I'm sorry.

589
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,360
No worries, baby. You'd better go.

590
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:02,780
Aw, don't cry.

591
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,240
We'll see each other again soon.

592
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,400
- Okay. I'll call you when I get home.
- Okay.

593
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,480
Alright, my pretty girl.

594
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,675
Okay, bye.

595
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,300
Captain, I'm in.

596
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,500
I'm thinking of finding a small plot of land

597
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,080
for the three of us. For you and our baby.

598
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,050
If we can be together here,

599
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,560
it would be great.

600
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,720
Do you really think

601
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,375
you can live...

602
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,220
a peaceful life?

603
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,240
Psychopaths are dangerous,

604
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,680
they must be eliminated from society.

605
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm not getting involved with this anymore.

606
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,720
I don't know what happened.

607
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,120
I'm lost. Everything's confusing.

608
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,720
How did the killer know that you assigned
Lt. Chin to investigate?

609
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,520
I don't get it.

610
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,830
An insider.
