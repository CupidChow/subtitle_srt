Hurry up.

- What do you feel like?

186
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:05,294
In a hurry to see your husband?

187
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:07,947
Oops, I forgot.

188

Her husband's in jail.

189
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:17,066
Or maybe just seeing his picture
is enough to get you off.

190

Hey!

191
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,707
How dare you touch me?

192

Who the hell do you think you are?

193

You think you're so tough, huh?

194

196

Are you all right?

197

198

Hey!

199
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,747
But she hurt my son.

200
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:58,626
It's obvious that your son
and his friends were ganging up on my niece!

201

What, was he trying to kill her?

Grandma,

203
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:05,306
- it didn't come to that. You can't say that.
- Right.

204
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,146
That's because my niece was defending herself.

205
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,467
That's why it didn't happen.

206
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,950
As the disciplinary teacher,

207
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,134
you should be looking at this fairly.

208
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:16,514
Calm down, Grandma.

209
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:20,054
How about we let both sides cool down first?

210
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,255
Then we can discuss it again.

211
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:24,263
No more discussion.
It's obvious who's at fault.

212
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:28,735
Do you know who they are, Grandma?

213
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,415
Why would I need to know?

214
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:35,814
Chatree's parents run the Parents' Association.

215
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:41,015
What if the other parents
find out what Picha did?

216
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:42,614
They might pressure us to expel her.

217
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:48,015
What? You can clearly see who's at fault,

218
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,015
so why are you taking their side?

219
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,588
What kind of teacher are you?

220
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:58,534
Grandma,

221
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:00,495
why don't you go home and sleep on it?

222
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:07,094
For now, I suggest both parties
go home and calm down.

Picha,

289
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:39,255
your grandma set fire to the school.

290
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,388
Luckily, it was put out in time.

But they refuse to settle,

292
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:48,255

- Take her away.
- Yes, sir.

Calm down, Picha. Have a seat.

00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:14,695
Your grandmother said...

298
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:16,731
she did it...

299
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:18,975

Based on the evidence at the scene,

303
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:42,094
the property was mostly just covered
in black soot.

304
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:45,415
So, it's not being considered
an arson case yet.

305
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:48,495
But your grandma is still guilty
of destroying another's property.

306
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,015
The sentence is six months
to seven years in prison

You'll have to talk to the school

310
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,190
and see if they'll press charges or negotiate.

311
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,124

the sentence won't be as severe.

00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,671
Pizza delivery. That'll be 349 baht.

365
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,111
I didn't order anything.

366
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,111
Oh, hold on a second.

367
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:57,990
This is 79/64, right?

368
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:02,870
But I didn't order it.

369
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,950
Sir, sir,

370
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,430
please wait. Let me just quickly check
with the shop.

371
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,030
Just a moment, sir.

372
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,710
It'll only take a second.

373
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:15,271
Hello? Boss?

374
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:18,550
The customer says he didn't order.

375
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,550
Boss, he's not going to wait much longer.

376
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,711
Hello? Boss?

377
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,111
Yes, they confirmed the address is correct.

378
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,311
They said it's correct.

379
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:32,895
It's a new item on the menu.
Wouldn't you like to try it?

380
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,591
Give me your manager's number.

381
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:40,510
Sir, there's no need to call my manager.

382
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,510
It was just a small misunderstanding.

383
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,030
Sir... please, sir.

384
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:16,649
Hey,

385
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:19,190
what were you doing?

386
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,431
Planting a GPS, sir.

387
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,030
So high-tech, PM's son.

388
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,030
Of course.

389
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:29,711
Mine's better.

390
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,430
What is it?

391
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,070
The evidence.

392
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:39,935
Are you going to tell the Unit
where you got this evidence?

393
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,391
You clearly stole it.

394
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,990
Deal?

395
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,550
I don't agree with this method, Captain.

396
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,591
But it might be the only evidence we have.

397
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,458
Haven't you thought of that?

398
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,631
PM's son.

399
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,790
Just go, darn it.

400
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:17,591
Go!

401
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,897
[Suthee, the guard]

402
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:50,429
[Abdominal incision, living death]

403
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,581
[Boxer, stabbed in the abdomen 10 times]

404
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:52,695
[One slash on forehead, doused with oil]

405
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:54,195
[Two wounds, blindfolded, fingers severed]

406
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,030
Kornkawin. It means "poet."

407
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:04,271
Hello?

408
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,791
The name has a beautiful meaning.

409
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:07,791
I like it.

410
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,631
Before the incident happened,

411
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:14,164
when was the last time you saw Rashen?

412
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:18,171
I came here to play badminton with a friend,

413
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,831
and left around 9 p.m.

414
00:45:21,616 --> 00:45:24,944
That day, we were in a meeting
until almost midnight.

415
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:27,375
My wife came to pick me up.

416
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,776
I was going to give Mr. Rashen a ride home,

417
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:32,856
but he said he was going to stay and work.

418
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,975
I came to request permission
to use the school grounds

419
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:39,367
for our athletes' training camp,
starting at 3 p.m.

420
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:43,616
I left around 7 p.m.

421
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,256
That day, I went to the temple fair
on the other side of town

422
00:45:46,256 --> 00:45:48,455
and got back around 10 p.m.

423
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:52,336
And you didn't hear anything suspicious?

424
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:54,935
My room is at the back of the building.

425
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,455
If something happened in here,
I wouldn't have heard it.

426
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,115
Grandma.

427
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:16,028
Grandma.

428
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,129
Wit.

429
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:27,689
How are you doing, Grandma?

430
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:29,288
I didn't sleep well.

431
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:32,434
My whole body aches.

432
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:36,802
Wit,

433
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,796
if I really have to go to jail,

434
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,448
please look after Picha for me.

435
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:49,095
You won't have to go to jail,

436
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:51,296
but it might take a little time.

437
00:46:51,296 --> 00:46:54,415
A volunteer lawyer is helping to mediate.

438
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:59,055
You'll just have to pay for the damages
to the school.

439
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:04,603
Where will I get that kind of money?

440
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,508
I'll take care of it.

441
00:47:14,895 --> 00:47:16,575
Thank you so much, Wit.

442
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:22,975
Picha, if you've read it and have no concerns,
you can sign here.

443
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,527
If something like this happens again...

444
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:46,989
I won't be able to help you.

445
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:52,856
Grandma, you're still working?

446
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:56,975
I have to keep working
to pay for Picha's school.

447
00:47:58,616 --> 00:47:59,616
Wit,

448
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:04,380
I'm so sorry for causing everyone
so much trouble.

449
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:07,055
Don't say that, Grandma.

450
00:48:07,055 --> 00:48:11,736
Don't worry about it.
We all have to help each other.

451
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:13,776
Thank you. Thank you so much.

452
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:16,495
Well, I should get going.

453
00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:18,216
Okay. Take care.

454
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:19,776
Picha, come here.

455
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:22,475
Don't go yet. Let's talk.

456
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,009
Don't go anywhere.

457
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:36,135
Thank you for helping my grandma and me.

458
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:10,856
Aha. I saw you sneaking glances at him.

459
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:15,095
What are you talking about, Grandma?

460
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:17,116
I was watching you.

461
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:18,575
Oh, Grandma.

462
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,215
You think I didn't see you?

463
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:32,336
Captain.

464
00:50:32,975 --> 00:50:34,582
What have you got?

465
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:38,328
I questioned everyone
on the clubhouse's member list.

466
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:41,195
Everyone has an alibi. No one is a suspect.

467
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:45,655
That's what I thought.

468
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,055
It wasn't anyone else.

469
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:53,216
It must be him.

470
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,776
[Ro Anong]

471
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:25,908
Hey,

472
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:28,375
don't stress about it.

473
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,442
I would've done the same thing.

474
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,455
I'm just furious with that teacher.

475
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:36,136
He only sucks up to the rich parents.

476
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:40,336
I'm lucky Wit used his position to get me out.

477
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:44,676
Otherwise, I'd still be in jail.

478
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:47,049
So it all worked out.

479
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:49,535
Then what are you still worried about?

480
00:51:49,535 --> 00:51:51,575
The cost of the damages.

481
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,762
It's not a small amount of money.

482
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,597
I already feel so bad that Wit had to help.

483
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:59,981
Now he's going to be in debt because of me.

484
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:04,743
Oh, right.

485
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:08,616
Are you still up for cleaning houses?

486
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:11,095
Yes, of course.

487
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:16,795
I have jobs at three houses this afternoon.

488
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:20,188
I was thinking I could give one of them to you.

489
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:22,375
- Yes, please! Thank you so much.
- Sounds good?

490
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,653
- What are you two talking about?
- Ugh...

491
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,955
Why is this so salty today?

492
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:28,196
Oh, sorry.

493
00:52:29,195 --> 00:52:30,563
Don't go anywhere, Grandma.

494
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,437
I'll bring back noodles for you tonight.

495
00:52:35,002 --> 00:52:37,736
Why is she so bossy?

496
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:39,616
She's not. She just acts that way.

497
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:42,294
So, when is the job?

498
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:44,154
I'll call you later with the details.

499
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:55,136
Captain,

500
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:58,003
the blood on the shoe belongs to Dr. Danai.

501
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,456
Captain, sir! Captain!

502
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,511
Why didn't you wait for the arrest warrant,
Captain?

503
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:11,642
He's so impatient.

504
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,996
Captain, please read my messages.

505
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,895
This is it.

506
00:53:29,895 --> 00:53:32,136
- Oh, we're here?
- This is the one.

507
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:35,575
Whoa! Mali, this place is huge.

508
00:53:35,575 --> 00:53:39,136
Listen, be careful when you're handling
their things.

509
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:42,776
You don't want to accidentally
break something valuable.

510
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:44,456
You have to be careful.

511
00:53:47,149 --> 00:53:49,822
- Why are you driving so recklessly?
- That's so scary.

512
00:53:52,136 --> 00:53:54,457
- Is this for this house?
- Looks like it.

513
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:55,457
Here you go.

514
00:53:56,857 --> 00:53:58,178
Oh, this is for the doctor.

515
00:53:58,178 --> 00:54:02,778
- Could you take it inside for him, please?
- Sure.

516
00:54:02,778 --> 00:54:05,377
If you need anything, just call me.

517
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:06,698
I'll be over in that house.

518
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:07,937
Okay.

519
00:54:07,937 --> 00:54:10,178
- You sure you'll be okay?
- I'm sure.

520
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:11,618
Thanks a lot.

521
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:12,937
- Good luck!
- You too!

522
00:54:12,937 --> 00:54:14,298
- Okay.
- Okay.

523
00:54:14,857 --> 00:54:16,138
Okay, call me if you need anything.

524
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:17,377
Will do.

525
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:46,517
[Left a message, a judge]

526
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:11,410
Hello?

527
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,144
Hello, Doctor.

528
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:16,337
It's your cleaner.
I'm here for my usual appointment.

529
00:56:16,337 --> 00:56:17,457
Not today.

530
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,897
I'm not home.

531
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:22,417
But my friend has already gone inside to start.

532
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:27,698
- What did you say?
- My friend is already inside cleaning.

533
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,738
M-Ma'am, you let someone else clean my house

534
00:56:29,738 --> 00:56:31,418
without telling me first?

535
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,537
Did you warn her

536
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:36,137
not to touch anything in that one room?

537
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:38,937
I'm sorry, Doctor.

538
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,698
I'll call her and tell her right away.

539
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,057
Go there. Now.

540
00:56:43,057 --> 00:56:45,387
Yes, yes, I'm calling now.

541
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,820
Why isn't she picking up?

542
00:57:16,897 --> 00:57:18,578
Where are you going?

543
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:20,711
You haven't finished the dishes.

544
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:24,178
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you haven't mopped the floor.

545
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:25,578
You have to finish.

546
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:27,011
Otherwise, you're not getting paid.

547
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:29,011
I'm not going anywhere, ma'am.

548
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:12,417
Hello, Grandma?

549
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,784
I-I-I found evidence.

550
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,464
Evidence of the murders.

551
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:18,360
What murder?

552
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,565
The murders! The Gold Leaf Killer!

553
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:25,098
Grandma, what's the evidence?

554
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:26,537
It's photos.

555
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,578
Okay, Grandma, can you take a picture
of them for me?

556
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:33,658
Okay, okay, hold on.

557
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:50,377
Hello, Wit?

558
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:52,657
Did you get the photo?

559
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:02,658
Where are you, Grandma?

560
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:04,017
Where am I?

561
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,897
I don't know where this is.

562
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:07,738
But I'm leaving now.

563
01:00:09,457 --> 01:00:11,137
Where should we meet?

564
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:14,937
Ma'am.

565
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:16,778
Doctor.

566
01:00:20,298 --> 01:00:22,698
How did you know I'm a doctor?

567
01:00:22,698 --> 01:00:27,057
I saw your photograph over by the TV.

568
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:30,218
This is my first time cleaning here.

569
01:00:30,218 --> 01:00:34,337
I'm not sure if my work is as good as Mali's.

570
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:41,860
If that's everything, I'll be leaving now.

571
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:43,950
Wait.

572
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:04,897
Yes, Doctor?

573
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:15,818
Thank you.

574
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:21,857
If you need me to clean again, just tell Mali.

575
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,017
I have to get going.

576
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:17,258
Ma'am.

577
01:04:17,258 --> 01:04:19,377
Does your friend live near your house?

578
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:20,377
Yes.

579
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,897
Why? Is something wrong?

580
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:24,257
Okay. That's all.

581
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:34,683
What the fuck? Hey!

582
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:37,658
- Hey, calm down.
- What the fuck is your problem?

583
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:39,578
I'm a police officer in pursuit of a suspect.

584
01:04:39,578 --> 01:04:41,778
I don't give a fuck if you're a cop!

585
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,707
I'm on duty.

586
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:45,298
Get out of the car! I don't care!

587
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,778
You hit my car and I'm in a hurry! Now!

588
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:47,897
Okay, okay.

589
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:51,057
Asshole. Fucking asshole driver.

590
01:05:08,258 --> 01:05:09,818
Wait, wait...

591
01:05:13,178 --> 01:05:14,178
Hello...

592
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:17,658
Hello, Grandma? Where are you now?

593
01:05:17,658 --> 01:05:19,018
I'm almost there.

594
01:05:21,057 --> 01:05:22,881
Wit, Wit, please hurry.

595
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,057
I'm scared.

596
01:05:26,457 --> 01:05:27,658
I'll be right there, Grandma.

597
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:28,818
Okay, okay.

598
01:10:56,738 --> 01:10:58,605
What happened?

599
01:11:00,017 --> 01:11:02,418
Why are Grandma and Wit like this?

600
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:05,897
What happened?!

601
01:11:08,378 --> 01:11:10,257
- My name is--
- Chanya.

602
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:12,097
I know you.

603
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:16,197
You saw the photos of my victims, didn't you?
