1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,481
Hello.

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,280
We...

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,963
haven't seen each other,

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
my son.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,800
[This series is a work of fiction.]

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,075
[Characters, behaviors, violence, places,
organizations, and events are fictional]

7
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,523
[and created for entertainment only.
Viewer discretion is advised.]

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:04,200
[MOUSE]

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,956
Have you ever heard of
an organization called OZ?

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,890
When Kan was a child, he never showed
any signs of violence.

11
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm afraid our kid will inherit
the psychopath gene from me.

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,421
Our baby will grow up just fine.

13
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm ready to expose everything.

14
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,160
[No to the terrible PM]

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,400
[Go away or we're all screwed]

16
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Cut the feed from the M News Station.

17
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,530
Break down the door
and shut down the broadcast now.

18
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,480
The Prime Minister ordered the feed to be cut.

19
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,960
But they're still on the air.

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,630
Police! What the hell are you doing?

21
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,880
I'll kill you.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,556
I'll fucking kill you!

23
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,390
I'm so sorry,

24
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,501
Captain.

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,016
I'm so sorry...

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Mil.

27
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm the one...

28
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,556
who killed Sangchai.

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
I did it...

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,030
to get revenge for what
he did to the woman I love.

31
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,460
Besides the Gold Leaf Killer cases...

32
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,260
That's right.

33
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,000
They all...

34
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,300
deserved to die.

35
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,789
What about Grandma Anong?

36
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,320
I...

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm sorry, Picha.

38
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,000
I found evidence of the murder.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
I admit, I really intended to kill her.

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,503
Because she knew I was the Gold Leaf Killer.

41
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,180
I don't have a black button,

42
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,503
so I used a white one instead.

43
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,256
Wit, is that you?

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm sorry, Grandma.

45
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Why did it have to be you?

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,400
Why did it have to be you who found it?

47
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,123
After I got my memories back...

48
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm...

49
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
sorry, Grandma.

50
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,070
As for Plawan's body, why reveal it now?

51
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,770
After my brain surgery...

52
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,240
with Dr. Orachun...

53
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
two years ago...

54
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,323
at the time,

55
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,583
I woke up and couldn't remember anyone.

56
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,230
You still don't remember Picha, do you?

57
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,950
Not long ago,

58
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,056
my memories started coming back.

59
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,663
I wanted to repent...

60
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,280
and expose the OZ organization
for what they've done.

61
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,996
But when they found out
what I was trying to do,

62
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:57,680
they used Plawan's body to have the cops
hunt me down instead

63
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,636
to stop me from exposing them.

64
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,116
I should've killed him sooner.

65
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,790
Don't shoot him. He'll be dead soon anyway.

66
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,376
What made you decide to change?

67
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,027
Because...

68
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
I fell in love with Picha.

69
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,520
[Run, Picha.]
[Only idiots would believe him.]

70
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,720
[I don't believe you, murderer.]
[Give him a second chance.]

71
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,160
Ramil...

72
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
- Ramil!
- How did you lie to me?

73
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,360
Ramil!

74
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,160
- I'm sorry, Captain!
- How the hell did you lie to me?

75
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm sorry.

76
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
What's happening?

77
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,930
Chanya, keep going.

78
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,428
What are you waiting for?
Go get the story. Hurry up!

79
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,240
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

80
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Let's go.

81
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,476
This is the confession
of the real Gold Leaf Killer.

82
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,000
I have a key witness
who is ready to talk about Wit's past.

83
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,260
I came to work
at the Peaceful Society Association,

84
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,440
and my job was to look after a boy named Karan.

85
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,230
- Picha! Picha.
- Quickly, get in there!

86
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,861
Karan's life was a setup.
He was like a lab mouse.

87
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,690
He was tested
and stimulated to provoke aggression.

88
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,861
Wit was different from the other kids.

89
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:51,480
He was quiet,

90
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,041
reserved,

91
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,543
and never showed any emotion.

92
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,720
The orders were: No scolding, no harsh words,

93
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,110
no teaching right from wrong,

94
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,826
no hugs,

95
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,402
no affection,

96
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:15,560
no kindness,

97
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,680
and no caring.

98
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,756
When he was sad,

99
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,880
no one ever comforted him.

100
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,236
Many times, I wanted to comfort him,

101
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,570
but the association's orders
stopped me from doing so.

102
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,823
Wit was such a poor kid.

103
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,556
He never had a single close friend growing up.

104
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,330
Wit never killed anyone...

105
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,996
until he received that mysterious letter.

106
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,094
[A murderer is a murderer.]
[Can't blame him. He's a lab mouse.]

107
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:18,520
[Save Wit.] [He's killed people!]
The letter said that...

108
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,703
Chuto was the one who killed his parents.

109
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,441
That's when I knew he'd killed Chuto

110
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,909
in the same way his parents were murdered.

111
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,660
Back then,

112
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,263
I found out there were many other kids
the association was taking care of.

113
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
In reality, they were just using them
for research.

114
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:22,745
Many of the kids... had good lives,

115
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:26,141
got a good education, and found good jobs.

116
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,403
But on the other hand,

117
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:33,400
many others turned into... killers.

118
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,760
Listen, stay right here. Don't go anywhere.

119
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,523
Not long ago,

120
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:13,290
I met an old colleague
who used to work at the association.

121
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,496
He told me that Dr. Kan...
and another friend...

122
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,040
had tried to... hack the association's data...

123
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:30,203
and had been targeted ever since.

124
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:35,847
In fact, the association was probably
already targeting those two.

125
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,327
But Dr. Kan died before they could get to him.

126
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:45,127
That's why I've tried to stay away
from the association ever since.

127
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
The evidence confirms that

128
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,160
the Peaceful Society Association was
established by the OZ organization as a cover.

129
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,680
In fact, they were secretly running
human experiments,

130
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,400
specifically on children
with the psychopathy gene.

131
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,000
Karan's name went missing from the list
of children with the psychopathy gene.

132
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,560
I thought Jirawan's child had been swapped
and then disappeared.

133
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,520
OZ must have considered it
another failed experiment,

134
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,670
so they stopped paying attention to them.

135
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
I later found out the child who disappeared
was actually still alive,

136
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
and that the OZ organization
wanted to turn this child into a killer

137
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,080
to support their theory that children
born with the psychopathy gene

138
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,960
are destined to become killers.

139
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,967
They fostered this...
through experimental stimulation,

140
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,360
turning his childhood resentment
into the rage of the Gold Leaf Killer.

141
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,476
[Save Wit.]

142
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,114
So, a number of children were essentially
used as lab mice

143
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:36,723
for this secret research. Is that correct?

144
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,800
What exactly are the Peaceful Society Association
and the OZ organization?

145
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,630
The association is a front used to control
and monitor these children

146
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,203
based on research from OZ.

147
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:20,480
Their duty was to conduct tests
under various conditions.

148
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,407
Some children were controlled and stimulated
to provoke violent behavior.

149
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:32,120
Some were held captive, while others
were raised in a positive environment.

150
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,160
Using human beings as lab mice.

151
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
But OZ stays behind the scenes,

152
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,040
conducting research
and controlling major policies.

153
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,800
Meanwhile, the Peaceful Society Association
handles the children,

154
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,800
using scholarships as a cover.

155
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
All to answer one question:

156
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,240
What is the true effect
of the psychopathy gene?

157
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Could it turn a child into a killer, or not?

158
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:26,000
But the Peaceful Society Association
and OZ are part of the same entity.

159
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,370
In that case, do you know
who is behind all of this?

160
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,530
It would have to be someone important

161
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:42,727
and powerful enough
to manage this for over 30 years.

162
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,680
Is it done?

163
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,200
What about Wit and his aunt?

164
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,880
Finish it. And do it quickly!

165
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,920
Based on all the evidence,
the person behind this...

166
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,990
is Ms. Bussarin, correct?

167
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
Yes, that's right.

168
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

169
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,383
Be careful. Easy now.

170
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Yes, sir.

171
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,440
The Prime Minister wants to speak with you.

172
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,920
Yes, sir.

173
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,687
Yes, sir.

174
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
But...

175
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,783
- Chief?
- Lower your weapons.

176
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,240
- Chief!
- Hey! Are you switching sides?

177
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,600
Hey, calm down. Calm down.

178
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Calm down.

179
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,710
[Jirawan]

180
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,366
Give it to her.

181
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,560
As I continued my work,
I began to realize what was happening--

182
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,640
It's Mrs. Jirawan on the line.

183
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,009
Okay. Excuse me for a moment.

184
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,520
Hello, ma'am?

185
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,520
Yes.

186
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,360
After the break,
put Mrs. Jirawan on the screen.

187
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,160
Got it.

188
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,456
I'm watching Ms. Chanya's program,

189
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,400
and I've decided to tell everyone
the whole truth.

190
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't want my son,

191
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Dr. Kan,

192
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,160
to be hurt by the knowledge that
he's the son of the Bounty Hunter.

193
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,143
So I told everyone that Kan was my adopted son.

194
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,680
So you aren't his biological mother?

195
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,923
Kan always believed...

196
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,976
he was my adopted son,

197
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,080
and he tried to find the truth for himself...

198
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,040
the truth about his parentage.

199
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,240
How did you know?

200
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,080
I know now that Dr. Orachun is my father.

201
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,716
Why did you do this?

202
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,320
Mom,

203
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,783
I want to know the truth.

204
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:46,923
I got the results from Dr. Danai,

205
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,843
and I didn't know what to do either.

206
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,963
Your father was sentenced to prison.

207
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,523
During my last visit,
I told him I'd already had an abortion.

208
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
I didn't want you to know who your father was,

209
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,203
so I kept it to myself.

210
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:14,583
If people knew who your father was,

211
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,723
how could you live a normal life?

212
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,896
I am Dr. Kan's biological mother.

213
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,680
Hello, sir.

214
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,116
You, get in there with me.

215
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,200
You, come with me.

216
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
What about what you said earlier,

217
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,480
about swapping your child
with the nurse, Mrs. Soontree?

218
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,720
I didn't want to do that.

219
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,936
I wanted to raise my son myself.

220
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,920
I was so happy to be Dr. Kan's mother.

221
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,683
But what I regret most...

222
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,200
is that Kan became a victim,

223
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,403
even though he wasn't a murderer.

224
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,763
Boss, please let me go.

225
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:45,830
Everyone judged him,
assuming he would turn out like his father.

226
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Kan is innocent.

227
00:27:50,806 --> 00:27:52,770
He's a good person.

228
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,320
Even though his father was a killer,

229
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,160
it didn't mean he had to be one, too.

230
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:19,703
Do you want a girl or a boy?

231
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,320
I haven't thought about it.

232
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,680
A boy or a girl, I'll love them either way.

233
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,480
Both Kan and Wit have been through enough pain.

234
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:07,167
Both Dr. Kan and Wit...
have the psychopathy gene.

235
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:12,545
But Wit's upbringing was neglectful.

236
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,692
He was ignored,

237
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:21,183
which caused him to be lonely and alienated.

238
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,920
Eventually, he was pushed so far

239
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,400
that his primal instincts
to harm others were triggered.

240
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,320
When raising a child with psychopathy,

241
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,454
they need to be given love,
warmth, and proper care,

242
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:47,976
so they can grow up
to live a normal life, just like us.

243
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,476
The OZ organization's purpose...

244
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,763
was to exploit this for their own benefit.

245
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,710
To serve their own political agenda
and ambitions.

246
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:05,294
Dr. Kan...

247
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:07,713
is an example...

248
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:11,130
of someone with the psychopathy gene...

249
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,600
who refused to surrender
to a destiny he never chose.

250
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,416
I believe if Wit had been raised
with love,

251
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,960
- warmth, and the care...
- Will you do it again? Huh?

252
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,800
- every child deserves.
- Hey, that's enough!

253
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,400
- What did you do to my son? Tell me!
- He could have grown up to be a normal person,

254
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
just like us.

255
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,614
Hey!

256
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,494
Hey, take it easy.

257
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,810
Will you... serve corrupt politicians,

258
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,783
or will you serve the people?

259
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,200
Get out! Get out! Get out!
[PM, resign now.]

260
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,499
Isn't it time for all of us
to look at ourselves?

261
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:24,505
To look at our children, and give them love,

262
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:28,403
care, and a proper upbringing?

263
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,410
So they can become good people.

264
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,560
So they won't have to bow down
to those in power,

265
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:44,176
who see their lives as nothing
more than lab mice.

266
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,436
[Incompetent PM, resign now.]
[We don't want this PM.]

267
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,843
Hurry! Go, go, go! Quickly!

268
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:07,290
Even though... I can't remember everything yet,

269
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:13,440
I know I have feelings for her.

270
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
If I don't make it,

271
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,427
please look after Picha and my child for me.

272
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:21,549
What exactly is wrong with you?

273
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,646
I'm so happy...

274
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,893
to suddenly become an uncle.

275
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,453
We could all be someone's lab mice.

276
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,014
Being manipulated into doing the wrong thing.

277
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,814
Yes,

278
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
everyone makes mistakes.

279
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,453
I've made them, too.

280
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:55,440
I have a secret of my own...

281
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,990
that I need to confess to everyone.

282
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:05,773
I witnessed the deaths of two victims
in the Bounty Hunter case.

283
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,453
The first victim

284
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:16,773
was Chujai, a journalist who was murdered.

285
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,080
The second victim...

286
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,400
was...

287
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,453
my own younger brother,

288
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,253
Chanachol.

289
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,560
My former name was Chutimon.

290
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,796
I'm the daughter of Inspector Pitak,
who went missing 27 years ago.

291
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,210
I decided to become a journalist...

292
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,768
because of...

293
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,840
Chujai.

294
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,176
I took that opportunity from her.

295
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,476
I stole her life.

296
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Imagine that,

297
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,276
imagine you knew you were about to die.

298
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,630
Wouldn't it be better to spend the time
you have left with the people you love?

299
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,163
Take good care of Picha
when you go back, alright?

300
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,489
I love her and worry about her so much.

301
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,573
But,

302
00:37:43,014 --> 00:37:45,270
since you got her pregnant...

303
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,680
I guess...

304
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
that makes you my brother-in-law.

305
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,293
Come on, let's have a drink. Cheers!

306
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:09,933
To the bond... between brothers-in-law.

307
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,733
Cheers.

308
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,480
You know what you just did, don't you?

309
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,120
You knew, didn't you?

310
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,240
And you didn't stop him.

311
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:31,688
Let's go.

312
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,080
You were shot?

313
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,880
We should get you to a doctor.

314
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,108
Thank you so much, Doctor.

315
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,960
What?

316
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,320
The signal was cut.

317
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,956
The online stream, everything.
It's all been cut?

318
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,830
What about the internet?

319
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,120
The internet was cut, too.

320
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
What the heck?

321
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,480
What happened?

322
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,336
We're completely disconnected.
We can't stream online anymore.

323
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,440
It's okay.

324
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,930
The truth is already out there.

325
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,923
I'm sorry, Dad.

326
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,363
Then why didn't you come home?

327
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:43,854
I wronged you, Dad.

328
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:48,496
I was the big sister
who couldn't protect her little brother.

329
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,523
I got my brother killed.

330
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,893
Sister!

331
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,014
Sister, please help my dad!

332
00:41:59,014 --> 00:42:02,823
- Where is your dad?
- And I tricked Chujai into going to her death.

333
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,910
I'm so ashamed of what I did.

334
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,296
I decided to run away
and was too scared to go back home.

335
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:20,464
I didn't know how I could ever face
mom and dad again.

336
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,323
I'm so sorry, Dad.

337
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:56,516
I know you won't run away again.

338
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,201
Here, for you.

339
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:53,973
Go easy on it.

340
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:56,747
- Do you want to eat some?
- No, I don't.

341
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,363
I'm sharing it with you. Drop the attitude.

342
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:00,787
Eat. Eat. Eat.

343
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:02,763
- Look at me.
- I'm not eating it.

344
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,133
Your son is still alive.

345
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:18,640
No father would let his own son die.

346
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,680
Can it be cured?

347
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:30,680
Hang in there, son.

348
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,800
Just hold on, my child.

349
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,080
Orachun,

350
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:50,514
you have a visitor.

351
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,000
Move.

352
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,534
Sit down.

353
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:51,854
Go ahead.

354
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:55,854
What is it?

355
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:00,960
Or are you still holding a grudge?

356
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,760
Holding a grudge is one thing.

357
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,356
But it's a pity for someone
who doesn't know the truth.

358
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,600
What do you mean?

359
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,280
You're Dr. Kan's biological father.

360
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,880
You killed your own son.

361
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:28,794
What the hell are you talking about?

362
00:46:28,794 --> 00:46:32,594
Jirawan revealed the truth
to everyone on a live program.

363
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,640
I am Dr. Kan's biological mother.

364
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,603
He would be so hurt knowing
he's the son of the Bounty Hunter.

365
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,995
- I didn't want to swap my child with Soontree's...
- No.

366
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:05,354
I wanted to raise my son myself.

367
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:07,154
Impossible.

368
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,995
No!

369
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,314
It's not true!

It's not true!

372
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,763
I don't know whether to pity you
or say you got what you deserve.

373
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,555
It's not true!

374
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,035
It's not true!

375
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:26,275
I don't believe you!

376
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:33,955
It's not true!

377
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,480
Call an emergency cabinet meeting.

378
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,320
Please, eat something.

379
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,929
Please, eat something.

380
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,840
With a mother so strong and smart,

381
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,560
our child is bound to be brilliant.

382
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,195
I got rid of it.

383
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:47,554
You killed my child?

384
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,423
You killed my son?

385
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,596
Your son is still alive,

386
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,720
and I know who he is.

387
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,920
No father would let his own child die.

388
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,720
As a result of Ms. Chanya's live broadcast,

389
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,130
she has become a suspect
for disclosing official government information.

390
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,910
She may face prison time.

391
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,600
The Prime Minister
is about to make a statement.

392
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,080
We're going live to the Government House now.

393
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,800
Regarding the experiments on children
with the psychopathy gene,

394
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,196
I can confirm that... I have no connection
to the Peaceful Society Association

395
00:50:58,196 --> 00:51:01,040
or the OZ organization whatsoever.

396
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,280
I am not taking this matter lightly.

397
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,920
We have established a committee
to investigate the facts.

398
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,880
As soon as there is a conclusion,
we will report it to the public.

399
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,400
Can't you tell us now, sir?

400
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Why does a committee need to be established?

401
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,080
How long will it take, sir?

402
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,920
The people are waiting for the truth, sir!

403
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,145
Can't you just tell us now?

404
00:51:29,145 --> 00:51:31,680
You can't keep postponing like this!

405
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,560
Please, calm down.

406
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,250
This is all under review by
the investigative committee.

407
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,920
As I said, once we have a conclusion,
we will inform the public.

408
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,035
It's the same statement
at every press conference, sir!

409
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,434
Please just tell the truth!

410
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:50,240
That concludes
the Prime Minister's brief statement.

411
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,496
As for further developments,

412
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:54,916

and report back to you.

if our child...

416
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,920
asks what his father was like,

417
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,743
you can tell him the truth.

418
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,316
But I just ask one thing.

419
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,936
Please tell them...

420
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,800
that his daddy...

421
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,809
loved them more than anything.

422
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,840
And also tell them that... his father...

423
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,640
loved his mother very, very much.

424
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:11,196
I love our child so much,

425
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,383

I love you too.

Thank you...

Regarding the incident six months ago,

437
00:56:31,378 --> 00:56:35,000
the court today has reached a verdict
in the case of Ms. Chanya,

438
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,600
a former reporter and host for M News.

439
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,720
She has been found guilty of disclosing
official government information.

440
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,543
She is sentenced to three years
in prison without suspension.

441
00:56:45,543 --> 00:56:47,880
As for the murder of the journalist, Chujai,

442
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,269
the court found that Ms. Chanya
did not harm the victim.

443
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,480
In fact, she was a victim herself.

444
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,496
Therefore, she will not be tried
on that charge.

445
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,400
How are you holding up?

446

01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,320
who I am...

541
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,200
and what I've done.

542
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,120
Because of that,

543
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,010
please...

544
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,556
don't let it weigh on you.

545
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,590
I need you to understand that...

546
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,280
your father is your father,

547
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,360
and you are you.

548
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,210
We're two different people.

549
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,183
You didn't do the things I did.

550
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,523
Don't ever carry that burden
or blame yourself, not even for a second.

551
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,696
If you're watching this video...

552
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,516
it means I'm probably not around anymore.

553
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,360
So,

554
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,520
please...

555
01:06:54,279 --> 01:06:56,856
protect your mom for me, son.

556
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,880
I hope...

557
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:10,456
you grow up healthy...

558
01:07:13,439 --> 01:07:15,456
and strong.

559
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,430
And no matter what happens,

560
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,320
I want you to know that...

561
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,329
I love you...

562
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,016
and your mother...

563
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,616
more than anything in this world.

564
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,889
Be a good person.
