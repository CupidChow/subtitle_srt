00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,990
Gold leaf was left on the body.

6
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,169
What message is he trying to send?

7
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,009
Or could it be referring to the Five Precepts?

8
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,336
So, in conclusion,
the police won't be able to catch the killer?

9
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,883
- What did you just say?
- No.

10
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,180
I'm getting older.

11
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,180
You should have someone
walk with you in the rain.

12
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,575
How do you know?

13
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:43,623
Your son's still alive and I know who he is.

14
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:46,636
I'll kill him.

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,590
I told you,

16
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:53,550
someone like you could never kill anyone.

17
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,763
We'll see.

18
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:59,310
All five victims knew you.

19
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,060
So you think it was me.

20
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,660
Those people are weird, aren't they?

21
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,720
When they want someone,
they treat them really well just to get them.

22
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,805
But after marriage,
they don't take long to cheat.

23
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,363
If you can't be faithful,
then why the hell did you even get with them?

24
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,059
You're right.

25
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,976
Then, do you want to be my boyfriend?

26
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,423
- What?
- So you'll understand why people get married.

27
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:12,350
Do you want to date me?

28
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,049
Well, I want to make a cup of coffee for you.

29
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:36,769
But no...

30
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,630
you need a rest.

31
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,575
This is the best part.

32
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,349
- Good?
- Yes.

33
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,016
All five victims...

34
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,236
knew you.

35
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,230
So you think it was me.

36
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:56,120
Sir.

37
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,538
- The restaurant's open, wake up.
- Hm?

38
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,506
The restaurant's open now.

39
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,613
Huh? What's the restaurant?

40
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:06,306
Hey.

41
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,450
Do you want to date me?

42
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,590
I don't think we should.

43
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:32,709
Why?

44
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,016
I'm not ready.

45
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:44,869
I've got many things to do.

46
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,182
What's up, Angkan?

47
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,583
The reporters are all here?

48
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,103
Okay.

49
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,505
Tell them to wait for me.
I will get ready and head out.

50
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,291
Yes.

[Maga One City Police Station]

52
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:17,729
- Could you give us some details?
- No.

53
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:22,925
Sorry, I can't.

54
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,860
What's the latest update
on the gold leaf serial killer?

55
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,083
And you mentioned earlier you have a lead
on the suspect. What exactly is it?

56
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,780
- Yes, could you please answer?
- Please answer.

57
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,340
I believe we now have
a pretty clear idea of the motive...

58
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,740
and that helps us predict
who the killer's next victim might be.

59
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,100
The next victim?

60
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,663
Is there another one?

61
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:56,445
Hello, officer.

62
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,843
- Hey.
- What's that?

63
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,660
It's not nice to lie.

64
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,230
What are you talking about?

65
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,125
Honestly, you cops don't really have anything.

66
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,255
But you go to the press acting like
you've got the leads.

67
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,087
That's what we call a flat-out lie.

68
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,123
The officers are lying?

69
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,296
What are they lying about?

70
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,540
Why don't you turn on the speaker?

71
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,816
So others can listen too.

72
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,660
- Turn it on.
- Turn the speaker on, please.

73
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,700
How is it?

74
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,676
- We're waiting, what is it?
- Turn it on.

75
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,060
Hello, everyone.

76
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,180
It's truly an honor to be given such a title.

77
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,940
I'm the Gold Leaf Killer.

78
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,660
- Hey! It's a murderer.
- The Golden Leaf Killer.

79
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,243
- What is it, Captain?
- What's happening, Captain?

80
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:52,820
Well, since the police announced they have
a lead and are ready to catch me.

81
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,156
If that's true, let's play a little game.

82
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,094
How about this Friday?

83
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,540
On Chanya's live show.

84
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,780
Captain, are you going to play the game?

85
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,356
And why the hell should I play your game?

86
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:08,525
Officer, this game isn't free to play,
you know.

87
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,260
You have to bet something to make it fun.
Don't you agree?

88
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,004
- Playing a game for a bet?
- What's the bet?

89
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,200
What the hell's your bet?

90
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:18,020
I want to go home!

91
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,430
Hey, that's a kid's voice!

92
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,460
A kid's voice.

93
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,520
- What's happening, Captain?
- You psycho bastard.

94
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,836
A kid's voice.

95
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,483
If you want to play, then play with me.

96
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:27,650
Don't drag other people into this!

97
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,856
See you soon, officer. Bye.

98
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:33,880
- Hey!
- Hey!

99
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,850
- Is this real?
- Hey, what's happening?

100
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:40,440
Officer, please help me!

101
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,790
My kid's been taken!

102
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,580
Hey, Mil!

103
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,780
- Ma'am, please come this way. Stay calm, okay?
- Ma'am, go with him.

104
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Hey, really?

105
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,940
- Captain, what's going on?
- What is this?

106
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,380
- Who called you?
- Who's he?

107
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,300
Is he the Golden Leaf Killer?

108
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,100
- And there's a kid involved. What's the game?
- Captain, what is it?

109
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,725
- Hey, Captain?
- Captain, please answer the questions!

110
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,856
Mil!

111
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,300
Why the hell did you go to the press
about the psychopath killer?

112
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,716
Now everything's a mess!

113
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,925
What do you expect me to do?

114
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,660
Why the hell are you playing along
with his game?

115
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,940
Come on! Even if I don't play along,

116
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,740
that kid's life would still be in danger,
wouldn't it?

117
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,476
- Are you really that stupid?
- What?

118
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't care. Listen to me.

119
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,425
You are forbidden from going on any shows.
Understand?

120
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,303
Captain, I'll help you.

121
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,046
Thanks.

122
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey, man. Calm down, okay?

123
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,223
Hey, Shinohm.

124
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,703
Yes, sir.

125
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,020
What did the Chief just say?

126
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,875
I don't really know.

127
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,617
Mil is pretty good, he understands.

128
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,046
Yes, Captain.

129
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:15,696
Come on, get back to work.

130
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:17,628
Yes.

131
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:27,825
Officer, this game isn't free to play,
you know.

132
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:31,740
You have to bet something to make it fun.
Don't you agree?

133
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:34,350
How about this Friday?

134
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,750
On Chanya's live show.

135
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,175
Hello.

136
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,575
Have you eaten yet?

137
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,316
Want me to get anything for you?

138
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,043
I'm fine.

139
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,129
I'm not that hungry.

140
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,536
You should eat something
so you can take your medicine.

141
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,525
That's all. Get well soon.

142
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,450
You've got an important job this Friday.

143
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,300
What kind of job?

144
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:54,843
Thank you so much.

145
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,516
Hey.

146
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,523
Have you eaten yet?

147
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,550
I brought a new lunchbox for you.

148
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,016
- The old one's really bad--
- Why are you here?

149
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,890
I just happened to have something
to do around here.

150
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:31,210
So I brought your favorite food.

151
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:33,380
You don't have to.

152
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:35,609
I don't have time to eat.

153
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,940
Don't have time? It's okay.

154
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,303
Put in the fridge.

155
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:44,700
You can eat it another day.
No need to let the food go bad like this.

156
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,875
I just hate to see it go to waste.

157
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:48,156
Right?

158
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,408
I'll get going then.

159
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,476
Hey.

160
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:07,375
Watch your step when you walk, alright?

161
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,225
If you fall and get hurt,
it'll just cause trouble for others.

162
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,575
Hey, Kan.

163
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,610
I sent the data files to your email.

164
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,153
Are you done?

165
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,176
Almost.

166
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:52,433
Done.

167
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,934
Now delete the IP address,
log out of all accounts,

168
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:59,811
and make sure there's no way to trace us.

169
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,089
Yes.

170
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Go find a safe place to lay low for a while.

171
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:08,900
Let things settle down first.

172
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,136
Where am I supposed to go?

173
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:15,926
As far away as you can.

174
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,048
Seriously?

175
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,590
Be careful.

176
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,203
Okay.

177
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,370
Same to you.

178
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,114
Come in.

179
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,843
Someone's been hacking into our data.

180
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,546
Is it something serious?

181
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,685
Do you know who it is?

182
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:00,685
Yes.

183
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,303
If you know, then talk to him nicely.

184
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:06,688
Just tell him not to do it again.

185
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,696
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,189
Test one, test two.

187
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:28,845
Go.

188
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,592
Let's see, is it connected yet?

189
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,592
Got it, sir.

190
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:39,688
- It's already online.
- Good.

191
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:53,460
Attention all units,

192
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,475
go to the spots we set up.

193
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:57,350
Roger that.

194
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,603
Let's go.

195
00:21:58,603 --> 00:21:59,980
You.

196
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,200
- Stay here.
- Got it.

197
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Let's go!

198
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:20,150
Wit.

199
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,150
Yes, sir.

200
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,340
You keep an eye on Dr. Kan.

201
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,083
But don't let anyone find out, got it?

202
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:29,500
Got it, sir.

203
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,518
Go, I'm counting on you.

204
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,800
Captain, this way please.

205
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,806
Yes.

206
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,575
Thank you.

207
00:23:40,906 --> 00:23:42,522
Do you think we can arrest him?

208
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:17,983
Where is the toilet?

209
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:47,150
[I'm heading out, I'll call you when I'm safe.]

210
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:45,926
Got the signal yet?

211
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,031
Just a moment, sir.

212
00:25:49,072 --> 00:25:52,436
You're impatient, Chief? Okay, all set.

213
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:59,111
Good evening, and welcome everyone
to the Investigative News show.

214
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:01,933
Tonight, we have a special episode.

215
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,220
We're covering a live hostage negotiation

216
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,543
with a young boy held captive.

217
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,990
A case directly connected to
the Gold Leaf Killer series.

218
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,741
The hostage is a ten-year-old boy.

219
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:23,350
The suspect, now known in the media
as the "Gold Leaf Killer,"

220
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,092
has committed a string of shocking crimes,

221
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,300
and killed many innocent people.

222
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,340
The Commissioner-General has personally tasked

223
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,470
the Special Investigation Unit
with solving this case.

224
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:10,620
The team is led by Captain Ramil,

225
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,950
an expert in handling psychopathic criminals.

226
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,300
Before this, Captain Ramil had tracked clues
that almost led him to the killer's identity.

227
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,180
As a result, the killer took the boy, Plawan,
as a hostage.

228
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
- He's doing this to bargain and play a game.
- I'm back, Grandma.

229
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,900
Yes. That's good.

230
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,275
Here. I don't know what's wrong with it.

231
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,517
Take a look for me.

232
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:37,900
The memory's full again?

233
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,250
Hey, I haven't put anything on it.

234
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,041
Captain Ramil is with me now.

235
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,780
Hello, Captain Ramil.

236
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,435
Hello.

237
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,550
What makes you so sure
the killer is a psychopath?

238
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,070
I'm sure the killer's a psychopath.

239
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:19,847
I've handled...

240
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,710
a lot of cases like this before.

241
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,425
They don't see their victims as human beings.

242
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,575
That's why they can commit such brutal acts.

243
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,825
These people think they're better than others.

244
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:54,950
That's why these people are called psychopaths.

245
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,325
They have no fear,

246
00:28:58,705 --> 00:28:59,727
no remorse,

247
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,580
no empathy,

248
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:05,060
no sympathy or pity.

249
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:44,156
Captain, I can't keep up.

250
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:47,136
Fuck!

251
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:59,784
[Unknown]

252
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,600
Hello, officer.

253
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,010
Wow, why are you in such a hurry?

254
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,800
Say hello to everyone.

255
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:48,540
Plawan!

256
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,325
Plawan!

257
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:53,900
Plawan!

258
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,575
Mommy, I want to go home!

259
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,775
Mommy!

260
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,450
Mommy!

261
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,725
Release the boy.

262
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,874
Then let's play fair from now on.

263
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:15,580
Whoa, you can't just do that, officer.

264
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,200
The show's just getting started.

265
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,750
Don't ruin the show. It's no fun.

266
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,375
But messing around with people's lives
like this you call that fun?

267
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,500
Calm down, Captain. Wait a bit longer.

268
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,750
Your childhood must've been really sad
and miserable, huh?

269
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,875
No one ever cared about a loser like you.

270
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:40,232
You started killing people to get the world
to notice you, didn't you?

271
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:46,476
But you're still scared

272
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,073
people won't realize
you're the one doing all of this.

273
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,334
That's why you left the mark on the bodies...

274
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,554
just to show off.

275
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,689
The mark?

276
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,434
What mark?

277
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,400
What the hell do you want?

278
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,700
Well, tell me more about the mark.

279
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,696
I just want to know how much you understand.

280
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:26,975
The number five.

281
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,543
The wounds and what you left
on the victims' bodies

282
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:32,932
are all connected to the number five.

283
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:37,425
So what does this number five mean?

284
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,150
Or could it be referring to the Five Precepts?

285
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,150
Well,

286
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:50,050
it could refer to the victims' sins
or their behaviors.

287
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,025
Like Chuto,

288
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:55,400
broke the first precept,
killing a living being.

289
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:59,350
On-uma broke the third precept,
sexual misconduct.

290
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,025
Suthee broke the fourth precept, lying.

291
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:07,219
Somphol broke the fifth precept, intoxicants.

292
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,320
The Five Precepts.

293
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:17,225
The mark on each forehead shows
which precept they broke.

294
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,588
Oh, wow.

295
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:26,400
Did you find out yourself?

296
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,300
Or did you borrow this idea from someone?

297
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,600
What the hell is it to you?

298
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:34,076
Officer. Why are you so aggressive?

299
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:35,249
Alright, alright.

300
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,900
So, have you figured it out yet?

301
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,375
Why did these people deserve to die?

302
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,075
Because these people...

303
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,628
did good without asking for anything back.

304
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,155
They worked in the shadows.

305
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,575
This answer is...

306
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,656
correct, but only half of it, officer.

307
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:13,035
I didn't kill these people
because they did good.

308
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:18,500
So? Can you actually tell me

309
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,800
why these people deserved to die?

310
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,225
They didn't deserve to die.

311
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:27,300
You're the one who shouldn't have killed them.

312
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,325
You psychopath!

313
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,425
Hmm, that's not an answer to my question.

314
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,080
Calling me a psychopath is slanderous.

315
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,402
There should be more reasons.

316
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:42,300
Like Chuto,

317
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,800
He tried to make amends

318
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,375
by saving lives after killing an entire family.

319
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:55,043
Or On-uma,

320
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,890
she helped other women to make up
for her past mistakes, her promiscuity,

321
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,750
and her delusion that she could be a saint.

322
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:07,505
But she couldn't.

323
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,660
And Suthee thought he was a good man,

324
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
turned out, he's two-faced.

325
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
He took credit for others' work
and blamed them for his mistakes.

326
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,440
Someone like him doesn't belong in this world.

327
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:21,230
And Somphol...

328
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:28,650
He once killed someone while drunk driving.

329
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,100
Then he used money to get away with it.

330
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,540
And he suddenly wanted to start
a rehab foundation?

331
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,175
Wasn't he a bit too shameless, officer?

332
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,750
And Judge Nida...

333
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:53,460
On the surface, she seemed fair in every case.

334
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,750
Once money's involved, fairness disappears.

335
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:06,071
Who hasn't done anything wrong?

336
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:11,057
What matters is that when they realized it,
they tried to change.

337
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:17,850
Are you blind, officer?

338
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,140
Can't you really see

339
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,725
they were trying to do good
to cover up what they did in the past?

340
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,820
You can see it everywhere

341
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,580
every inch of them screams,
"I'm a good person!"

342
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,300
Totally fake!

343
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,075
But you only blame others,

344
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:38,780
go around judging people

345
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,925
and act like a judge yourself?

346
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:47,211
A judge decides who's right and who's wrong.

347
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:51,200
But the one who decides who lives and dies

348
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,875
is the Grim Reaper.

349
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,975
So you think you are the Grim Reaper? Huh?

350
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,820
I'm just showing society the truth

351
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,900
that those people they praise as saints...

352
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,875
can't even follow the Five Precepts!

353
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:14,000
Instead of making amends for the sins
they committed,

354
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:19,463
they think they can make up for it
by following the rules they once broke?

355
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:23,060
These shameless, vile people...

356
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,060
should be cleansed
and purged from society, officer.

357
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,874
Don't you agree with me?

358
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,705
So you're saying you do good behind the scenes?

359
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:37,820
Bingo!

360
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:47,117
But that's not the question I asked, officer.

361
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,850
- We've got the location, sir.
- Hey, send it out.

362
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:57,250
The location has been sent out.

363
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,268
Okay, roger that.

364
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,293
Copy that.

365
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:04,100
Tawee, let's go. We've got the location.

366
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,775
- Let's go, guys.
- Yes.

367
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,675
Sergeant, check on the location.

368
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:25,875
Stop! Get out of the car!

369
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,540
- Get out!
- Come on, hurry up!

370
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,700
What's the plate number?

371
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,820
7878.

372
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,328
Open the trunk.

373
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,600
What the hell is this?

374
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,950
It means...

375
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,775
Chief, we were set up.

376
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,060
Shit!

377
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,110
And what?

378
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:15,064
What did the kid ever do? Huh?

379
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:17,997
- Hey.
- What is it?

380
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:19,147
Got another location, sir.

381
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,850
The killer used a decoy signal.

382
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,450
He's changed his route.
Sending new coordinates now.

383
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:29,154
Copy that.

384
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:31,844
Open the new location.

385
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:33,941
Sarge, make a U-turn.

386
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,102
Alright then...

387
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,780
Tell me, officer.

388
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,475
What do you think this little Plawan...

389
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:54,925
did wrong?

390
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,514
He's just a kid.

391
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,650
Even if he did something wrong, he deserves
a second chance more than any adult.

392
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:22,175
You're really optimistic, aren't you, officer?

393
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:37,650
Hey, let me tell you something.

394
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,600
That little bastard...

395
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:42,483
has been stealing all his life.

396
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,133
Can't even count how many times.

397
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:49,025
But this time, just because
he decided to return the money

398
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:51,450
and do the right thing for once,

399
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:57,000
he gets a reward and becomes famous overnight?

400
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,340
It's because of people like you
who glorify people like him.

401
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,705
And then what?

402
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:06,208
So all the sins he's committed
just magically disappear?

403
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,780
That's not right, is it, officer?

404
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:32,324
Shit!

405
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,857
We've been set up.

406
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,300
I'm sorry, officer.

407
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,275
Someone interrupted me earlier.

408
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:10,900
Where were we?

409
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,925
Ah, right.

410
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,450
This is the last question, officer.

411
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,450
If you get this question right,

412
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,275
you'll get a double bonus.

413
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,460
You'll jump two ranks.

414
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,980
Hey,

415
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,455
the same rank as me.

416
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,008
Bonus?

417
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:33,564
What's your fucking bonus?

418
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:35,816
You want to know?

419
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:38,867
The bonus is...

420
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,525
Rashen.

421
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,750
Rashen.

422
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,950
Bro...

423
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,775
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

424
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:08,050
What's my brother got to do with this?

425
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Watch your language, officer.

426
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:17,300
This show is airing live across the country.

427
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:19,883
As I told you,

428
00:43:19,883 --> 00:43:22,758
if you answer this question correctly,

429
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,425
you will get the special bonus.

430
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:27,400
Both of them can go home,

431
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,691
and everyone gets a happy ending.

432
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,180
And the question is...

433
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,386
Is your brother...

434
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:43,050
doing good to cover something up?

435
00:43:46,811 --> 00:43:47,851
Nothing.

436
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,576
Ooh.

437
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:53,719
Answer carefully, officer.

438
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,863
Don't take too long.

439
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:02,844
My brother has never hurt anyone.

440
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:06,231
He's not one to seek attention.

441
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:10,808
He never judges and has nothing to hide.

442
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:15,233
My brother has never broken a single precept.

443
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,725
- I've booked it in advance, teacher.
- Hey, you.

444
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:25,350
Why can't I use this area?

445
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,700
The Women's Association
has already requested the venue.

446
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:29,850
School.

447
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,825
Picha, where are you going? Hey!

448
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,575
My brother is a good guy.

449
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:39,011
He never gets angry,

450
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:41,449
he forgives everyone.

451
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,196
Forgive?

452
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:49,494
Really?

453
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,075
Yes.

454
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:54,980
Can he really forgive someone
who killed his parents?

455
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Yes.

456
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:10,980
Anyone who falls for that is an idiot.

457
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,790
Come on, who in this world

458
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,299
could truly forgive someone who murdered
their parents with a pure heart?

459
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,475
I'm telling the truth.

460
00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:21,325
Even you don't seem to believe it yourself!

461
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:23,025
Don't be so self-centered!

462
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:26,780
Don't judge others for how they think,

463
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,525
especially when you're wrong yourself!

464
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:31,142
You have no right to kill someone!

465
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:00,750
Officer!

466
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,191
The killer...

467
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:04,486
The killer is at Maga One Wittaya School.

468
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,740
Hurry up!

469
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:16,600
But I have a knife in my hand.

470
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,825
No... No!

471
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:21,300
No! No! No!

472
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,100
No, please stop.

473
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,170
I'm begging you. Please, stop.

474
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,642
Don't hurt him. Please, don't hurt my brother.

475
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:32,900
Please.

476
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:45,225
Come on, officer.

477
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,875
Don't cry.

478
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:54,700
Your tears aren't the answer I'm looking for.

479
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,005
Then what am I supposed to do?

480
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:12,400
What do you want me to say?

481
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,300
Just tell me... I'll do it.

482
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,275
I'll do everything. Please.

483
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:17,533
Wow.

484
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,200
That really touches my heart.

485
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,100
Well, since it's you...

486
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,620
I'll give you another chance.

487
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:34,750
I'll let your brother go,

488
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,550
if he admits the truth that...

489
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,150
he's been carrying anger,

490
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,150
hatred,

491
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,050
and a desire for vengeance for everything
that's happened to him.

492
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,225
Okay?

493
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:57,774
Come on!

494
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,500
Say it!

495
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,000
- Tell him, bro.
- Say it!

496
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,050
- Say it.
- Tell him.

497
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,575
Tell him.

498
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,900
How angry are you,

499
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,650
how much hatred you feel,

500
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,850
and you've never forgiven what happened.

501
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,625
Tell him, bro!

502
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:18,000
Tell him, please.

503
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:21,675
Tell him how angry you are.

504
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,475
Just tell him you're angry.

505
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,547
You're angry that our parents died.

506
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:29,592
You're angry that you've got
a messed-up little brother like me.

507
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,425
Just tell him, bro.

508
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,775
Tell him.

509
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,330
Please.

510
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,180
Please, just say it.

511
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,650
Brother.

512
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,775
I'm begging you. Just say it.

513
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:56,525
Thanks...

514
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,175
for believing me.

515
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:02,980
No, no, no.

516
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,730
Just tell him you're angry.

517
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,625
You're fucking angry, please. Please.

518
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,850
Please.

519
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:21,370
What do you want?

520
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,025
What the fuck do you want from me?

521
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:25,050
Officer.

522
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:29,850
Don't blame me for being cruel.

523
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,820
No.

524
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,125
Bro...

525
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,200
Please.

526
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,371
No!

527
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:45,376
Hey!

528
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,825
No! Rashen!

529
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,340
- Rashen!
- Turn it off!

530
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,200
Cut the signal now.

531
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,825
I said cut it!

532
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Okay.

533
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:03,820
No!

534
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,700
No, no...

535
00:51:17,135 --> 00:51:20,060
[Doing good gets you killed]

536
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,540
Rashen!

537
00:51:45,525 --> 00:51:46,925
Picha!

538
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:47,925
Picha...

539
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:55,900
It's okay, Picha.

540
00:52:37,225 --> 00:52:38,225
Let me go!

541
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,025
Let me go!

542
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:46,500
Let me go, I'm going to see my brother!

543
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,875
Let me go!

544
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,000
Let go of me!

545
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,780
