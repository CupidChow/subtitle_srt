00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:07,205
How is that possible?

360
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:15,565
Do you know where the transfers came from?

361
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:17,484
Not yet, sir.

362
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:18,844
Lieutenant Adisak is checking on it.

363
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,085
Hey, PM's son.

364
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:51,765
What have you got?

365
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:55,924
Here you go, Captain.

366
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:07,884
Captain, Dr. Danai's car is still there.

367
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:29,645
Well, go take a look.

368
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:55,645
I don't see anything, Captain.

369
00:46:59,004 --> 00:47:00,004
There has to be something.

370
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:25,525
Captain.

371
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,924
Check all the CCTV cameras in this area,

372
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:44,685
both on the side streets and the main road.

373
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:45,685
Yes, Captain.

374
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:15,284
Kan!

375
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:30,045
Thanks.

376
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:31,525
I'm planning to get away for a while,

377
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,685
but I still haven't figured out where.

378
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:34,685
When are you going?

379
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:36,924
In a couple of days.

380
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,685
Be careful.

381
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:47,004
I should get going.

382
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:48,004
See you.

383
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,004
- Captain, excuse me.
- Captain, could we get an interview?

384
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:55,205
Have you found any evidence the killer left
at the crime scene?

385
00:48:55,205 --> 00:48:57,085
Is the culprit the Gold Leaf Killer?

386
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,844
- So, have the police identified the killer yet?
- Right?

387
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:02,004
If I knew that, would I be standing here
talking to you?

388
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:05,364
Please answer the question.

389
00:49:05,364 --> 00:49:08,045
- When will you catch the killer?
- What do you have to say?

390
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,404
In other words, are the police incapable
of handling this case?

391
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:52,575
What's wrong?

392
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:53,575
Hm?

393
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,884
What are you doing here?
Aren't you going back to the unit?

394
00:49:57,924 --> 00:49:59,284
Uh... may I?

395
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,804
The remote isn't working for some reason.

396
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:05,730
It must be stuck.

397
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,730
Oh.

398
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:13,284
I'm not going back to the unit tonight.

399
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,245
I have to work till dawn.

400
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:18,364
No sleep.

401
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:27,725
I'd make you a cup of coffee,

402
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:32,205
but you shouldn't.

403
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:34,302
You need to get some rest.

404
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:36,245
Yeah.

405
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:37,844
Drive safe.

406
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:40,565
Oops. It's working now.

407
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:42,245
Drive safe.

408
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:08,066
Looking at the cases,

409
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,525
the killer seems very skilled with a knife.

410
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,921
They know all the vital spots.

411
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:14,385
Their precision is incredible.

412
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,324
You mean, like a doctor?

413
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,125
It's possible.

414
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:25,351
Bring me the files
on people connected to the victims.

415
00:51:28,072 --> 00:51:29,556
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

416
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:33,511
Yes, Captain.

417
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:39,321
According to the intel,

418
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:42,471
On-uma took sex workers she'd
helped to get medical treatment.

419
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,592
Chuto also took injured people
to get treatment,

420
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:49,232
Somphol consulted with an addiction specialist.

421
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,031
And Nida represented him in court
when he was a teenager.

422
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:57,871
Suthee... what's his connection?

423
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:01,471
I'll go to the prison tomorrow
and get the information.

424
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:04,871
Excuse me.

425
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,272
I've got Dr. Danai's phone records.

426
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:12,072
The last person he contacted
was Dr. Kankavin, sir.

427
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:50,672
- Oh, Grandma!
- Oh, Wit!

428
00:53:50,672 --> 00:53:53,712
- Hello.
- Hello. Have you been here long?

429
00:53:53,712 --> 00:53:55,672
- I just arrived.
- Oh.

430
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:56,911
Are you here to pick up Picha, Grandma?

431
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,031
Yes, yes, yes.

432
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:03,272
Well, I should get going then.

433
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:05,552
Thanks, son.

434
00:54:05,552 --> 00:54:07,391
Get home safe, okay? It's raining.

435
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:08,792
Yes.

436
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:09,792
Goodbye.

437
00:54:27,194 --> 00:54:28,194
Hey,

438
00:54:29,052 --> 00:54:31,475
why are you sitting here, sweetie?

439
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:35,552
Why did you take so long?

440
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:38,712
Oh, sweetie, don't be scared. Don't be scared.

441
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:39,911
It's raining, dear.

442
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:42,351
Don't be scared. Grandma's here.

443
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:43,632
Don't be afraid.

444
00:54:46,712 --> 00:54:48,152
I'm scared, Grandma.

445
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:52,752
I know, I know. I'm right here with you,
so why are you afraid?

446
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,471
Don't be afraid.

447
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,311
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

448
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,152
I have something for you.

449
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:09,152
Want to see?

450
00:55:09,152 --> 00:55:10,871
Here you go.

451
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,161
What is it, Grandma?

452
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:14,187
Here.

453
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,384
It's for you.

454
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:19,632
I don't want it.

455
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:20,632
Why not?

456
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,112
Because Grandpa gave it to you, not me.

457
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,871
Well, he gave it to me,

458
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:27,391
but I'm giving it to you.

459
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:32,752
Do you know? This bracelet brings me good luck.

460
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:33,792
How is it lucky?

461
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:37,831
- Well, I got to marry your grandfather.
- Grandma, what are you getting at?

462
00:55:40,072 --> 00:55:41,752
I'm getting older every day.

463
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:47,311
You should have someone
to walk in the rain with when I'm gone.

464
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:50,792
I worry about you. Do you understand?

465
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:58,712
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

466
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:05,072
I'm going to get changed.

467
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:06,227
Good idea.

468
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:07,866
Go on.

469
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:40,592
Come on out. It's pouring now.

470
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,632
Just walk. Don't be afraid.

471
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:47,232
Walk, walk. There's nothing to be afraid of.

472
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,471
I'll take care of everything.

473
00:56:49,471 --> 00:56:52,991
Keep walking. It's raining hard now.

474
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,712
Why are you backing away?

475
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,951
Picha, walk. Can't you see it's raining?

476
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,831
I'm right here. What are you afraid of?

477
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,951
Hurry up, it's raining!

478
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,632
Doctor, someone is here to see you.

479
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:40,552
But I don't have any appointments.

480
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:43,471
It's the police.

481
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,391
What can I do for you, officer?

482
00:58:17,152 --> 00:58:19,911
You were the last person he called
before he disappeared.

483
00:58:21,712 --> 00:58:22,712
Is that so?

484
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:27,552
Friday, 5 p.m.

485
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:30,792
Where were you, Doctor?

486
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:35,991
I think you have the wrong person.

487
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:38,431
Answer the question.

488
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:46,431
I was here, working. I have witnesses.

489
00:58:49,311 --> 00:58:51,351
It would be better
if you just told me the truth.

490
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,072
What do you mean?

491
00:58:56,391 --> 00:58:58,471
You know about the serial killer, don't you?

492
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,351
All five victims...

493
00:59:05,311 --> 00:59:06,471
they all knew you.

494
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,552
So you think I did it?

495
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,351
No.

496
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:15,431
I'm just suspicious,
so I came to ask a few questions.

497
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,592
A simple conclusion to jump to.

498
00:59:22,632 --> 00:59:24,112
If I were the killer,

499
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:26,911
I wouldn't do it so simply.

500
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:28,072
Then what would you do?

501
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:31,871
I'm a doctor.

502
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:35,327
I'd do something far more clever...

503
00:59:36,481 --> 00:59:38,752
than a cop like you could ever imagine.

504
00:59:57,072 --> 00:59:59,192
Dr. Kan said he was at the hospital all day.

505
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:01,227
Check on that.

506
01:00:15,752 --> 01:00:16,911
Get me Dr. Kan's profile.

507
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,951
What's up?

508
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,991
Captain, I have Dr. Kan's profile.
I'm sending it to you now.

509
01:00:52,272 --> 01:00:53,272
Thanks.

510
01:02:29,391 --> 01:02:30,431
How did you know, son?

511
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:40,752
I'm sorry, I...

512
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:46,471
I'll go see who it is.

513
01:02:54,712 --> 01:02:55,712
Can I help you?

514
01:02:59,511 --> 01:03:00,552
It's been a long time.

515
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:10,866
Wasn't seeing you at the hospital enough?

516
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:12,669
Calm down, son.

517
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,667
Please, come in.

518
01:04:03,747 --> 01:04:05,227
Do you know a Dr. Danai?

519
01:04:07,946 --> 01:04:08,986
Which Danai?

520
01:04:14,787 --> 01:04:15,787
Oh...

521
01:04:16,547 --> 01:04:17,986
Danai. Yes.

522
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,147
I remember you.

523
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:25,306
Here is the evidence?

524
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:29,187
This isn't evidence. He's a witness.

525
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,187
You're Dr. Orachun's wife.

526
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:39,826
Which means...

527
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:42,546
that you, Dr. Kan,

528
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:46,826
are the son of Dr. Orachun,

529
01:04:48,547 --> 01:04:49,787
the Head Hunter killer.

530
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:03,187
Actually, I should thank Dr. Danai
for leading me here.

531
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,787
I came here looking for a certain truth,

532
01:05:15,147 --> 01:05:16,667
but I ended up discovering another one.

533
01:05:31,946 --> 01:05:34,546
This Friday, there will be a press conference
on the Gold Leaf Killer case.

534
01:05:34,546 --> 01:05:36,426
Mm, thanks.

535
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:37,747
Are you at the station?

536
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:38,866
I'm heading that way.

537
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:40,274
I'm at home.

538
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,826
I'm not feeling well.

539
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:43,826
Okay.

541
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:20,187
What do you want?

542
01:06:21,147 --> 01:06:22,747
I've got good news for you.

543
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:25,547
I don't want to know.

544
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,946
I know who your son is.

545
01:06:37,107 --> 01:06:38,267
No way.

546
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:39,267
Are you sure?

547
01:06:42,306 --> 01:06:43,306
What did you find out?

548
01:06:52,787 --> 01:06:53,906
Your son is still alive,

549
01:06:56,627 --> 01:06:58,426
and I know who he is.

550
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:02,667
I'll kill him.

551
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:10,102
I told you,

552
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:14,267
a man like you can't kill anyone.

553
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,426
We'll see.

555
01:07:32,426 --> 01:07:33,707
Where have you been?

556
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:36,205
The Prime Minister is on my case again
about Judge Nida,

557
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:37,600
the judge who was murdered.

558
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Any news?

559
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:41,067
We have a lead on the culprit, Chief,

560
01:07:41,826 --> 01:07:42,946
but we still don't have any evidence.

561
01:07:45,787 --> 01:07:48,866
Okay, organize a press conference for tomorrow.

562
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:52,707
We can use the opportunity
to update the press on our progress.

563
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:54,497
That'll put the Prime Minister's mind at ease

564
01:07:54,497 --> 01:07:55,906
and show some results.

565
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:59,627
For now, you'd better get some rest.

566
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:00,826
Prepare for the press conference.

567
01:08:01,426 --> 01:08:02,426
Okay, sir.

568
01:08:46,307 --> 01:08:47,787
Hello?

569
01:08:47,787 --> 01:08:50,547
I brought you some soy milk and fried dough.

570
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:52,026
I hung them on your door.

571
01:08:55,986 --> 01:08:58,066
If you need anything, give me a call.

572
01:10:36,587 --> 01:10:38,106
I am the Gold Leaf Killer.

573
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:39,667
- The killer?
- What does he mean, the Gold Leaf Killer?

574
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:41,946
- What's he saying?
- Let's play a game.

575
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,866
If you want to play a game, play it with me.
Leave innocent people out of it!

576
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,427
See you around, officer.

577
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:48,427
Bye-bye.

578
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:55,587
Even if I don't play his game,
the child's life is already in danger!

579
01:10:55,587 --> 01:10:56,747
Are you that stupid?

580
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,266
Captain Ramil is now seated beside me.

581
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,266
Go on, say hello to our viewers at home.

582
01:11:14,387 --> 01:11:17,427
You must have had a truly pathetic
and pitiful childhood.

583
01:11:17,427 --> 01:11:19,001
Is that why you started killing people?

584
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:21,866
Because you're desperate
for the world's attention?

585
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:31,707
Please, I'm begging you.
