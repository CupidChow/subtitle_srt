1
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,563
Do you remember what that sound was?

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,710
Our baby's heartbeat.

3
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,320
I miss you so much.

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,200
[This series is a work of fiction.]

8
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,040
How much time do I have left?

9
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,743
What are you planning to do?

10
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:12,040
You don't have much time left.

11
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,823
If there's something you want to do, do it now.

12
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,160
There's something I want to do before I die.

13
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,880
People who are no longer useful
shouldn't get special privileges.

14
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,143
Hey, take it easy.

15
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:27,983
Who did this?

16
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,662
Who?

17
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,690
I'm asking you who!

18
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,422
Why?

19
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,240
Why is the Psychopathic Abortion Bill
so important to you?

20
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,880
I got the OZZI tattoo

21
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,280
because I like the singer.

22
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,023
Where did you find this bracelet?

23
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,902
Go on, shoot me.

24
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,960
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes. Yes.

26
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,463
I'll take care of it.

27
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,263
Don't worry, sir.

28
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,782
Ramil,

29
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,723
you should... drop this case for now.

30
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,422
Why?

31
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,263
Trust me.

32
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:38,703
Step away from this one.
I'll assign someone else.

33
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,362
- I really... can't push back on this one.
- Who gave the order?

34
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,062
Who do you think?

35
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,862
The Prime Minister.

36
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,903
Then what do you want me to do?

37
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,810
Take this case instead.

38
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:07,696
I'm counting on you. Do it right.

39
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,870
Hello, I found your missing dog, Gaka.

40
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,760
Who told you Gaka was a giant breed?

41
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,596
Gaka's a Shih Tzu!

42
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,982
What kind of cop can't even return
a lost dog to its owner?

43
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,840
Do I have to go find her myself?

44
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
This is such a waste of time.

45
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,050
I'm already stressed out
because my dog is missing.

46
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,560
Why did you tell me
this wasn't the right house?

47
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,163
Which way did he go? Come on.

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,800
There you are. You're unbelievable.

49
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
I messaged you so many times.

50
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,896
Couldn't you be bothered to read one?

51
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
Still ignoring me.

52
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:26,222
Hello?

53
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,280
Anybody home?

54
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,183
Read your messages.

55
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh, right.

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,336
What is it?

57
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,302
[I made a copy. It's in the trash.]

58
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,102
The trash?

59
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Where is it?

60
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,269
Darn, he's smarter than I am.

61
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Genius.

62
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:48,622
Hey.

63
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,520
- Hey.
- What?

64
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,567
What are you doing here again?

65
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,640
I didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm not here to arrest you.

67
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,040
I need you to open this file for me.

68
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,280
- A file?
- Hm.

69
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm busy, can't you see?

70
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,683
Come back in two... or three months.

71
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:16,582
Want me to find a reason to arrest you?

72
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:19,600
For what? I told you, I haven't done anything.

73
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Your porn site is still up and running.

74
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
I know all about it.

75
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,783
I'll ask you again.

76
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
How many days?

77
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,383
Two days.

78
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,040
I'll put a rush on it.

79
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
Good.

80
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,170
Where is Ramil?

81
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,422
Why are you all just sitting around?
Get to work! Go!

82
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:53,916
Hurry up, get back to work.

83
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,320
Have you gotten anything done?

84
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Go on, get out of here!

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,782
What now? I told you to go. Stop slacking.

86
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,960
- Hurry up. Get to work.
- I am, sir.

87
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,670
All you ever do is yell.

88
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,542
Hey, you're still working?

89
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,496
Why haven't you taken leave
to check on Parinda?

90
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:19,040
I want to take a break, man.

91
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,335
But it's been so stressful lately.

92
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,440
All right then,

93
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,230
let's go grab a drink.

94
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:29,223
- Are you done for the day already?
- Yeah, I took the day off.

95
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:33,570
Ugh... What the hell is this?

96
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh, it's a huge pile! Whose shit is this?

97
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,590
W-W-Who let their pet take a dump here?

98
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,120
A dog? How did a dog get in here?

99
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,200
Whose... Whose dog is this?

100
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,170
How should I know?

101
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,670
Eat up.

102
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,036
You're eating for my nephew now, too.

103
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:04,953
I know.

104
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,240
- Ramil.
- What?

105
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Can I ask you something?

106
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,920
What if... the person you love...

107
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
turned out to be a killer.

108
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,120
What would you do?

109
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,594
I'd turn them in. Of course.

110
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,394
It's not that hard.

111
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,720
But what if you loved them so much,

112
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,550
you'd break the law just to keep them with you?

113
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,896
Did Wit kill someone?

114
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,910
No, I'm just asking.

115
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,710
Hypothetically.

116
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
Are you kidding?

117
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,296
What kind of question is that?

118
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
But...

119
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,950
it is possible.

120
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,650
People are capable of doing terrible things...

121
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,730
when they're blinded by love.

122
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,840
Is it possible... for a brain transplant

123
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,680
to transfer a person's thoughts and memories

124
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,400
into another person's body?

125
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,303
Because earlier, I felt like
Wit had Kan's memories.

126
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,869
Scientifically speaking, the brain's structure

127
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:25,756
and age are unique to each person.

128
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,783
So it's hard to say if that's even possible.

129
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,710
What should I do?

130
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,590
Do what you believe is right.

131
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,796
I'll always be by your side.

132
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,160
I think you're still attached to him.
Because, deep down...

133
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,976
you know Kan's brain is inside of him.

134
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,556
Do you think I'm like him?

135
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,336
Sometimes, I think that too.

136
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,929
Because sometimes,

137
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,636
I really do feel like him.

138
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,030
But I had these feelings
before I even knew about the transplant.

139
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,756
It could be that the two parts of the brain
are still interacting with each other.

140
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,840
But Wit is getting weaker

141
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,236
because his body is rejecting Kan's brain.

142
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
What do you mean?

143
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
He's dying.

144
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,196
[Sweet Dreams Hotel]

145
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
Captain.

146
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Where have you been?

147
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,880
I told you to pick up Picha,

148
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,976
and you just hung up on me.

149
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm sorry.

150
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
Have you eaten yet?

151
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,023
Why won't you listen to me?

152
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,970
I told you to take care of Picha,
but you didn't.

153
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,376
Anyone else... can do this job.

154
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,960
What's the big deal?

155
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,560
I can't, sir. I--

156
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,360
Papaya Salad is ready.

157
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,730
Thank you.

158
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,480
I have to earn a salary, don't I?

159
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,280
How else am I supposed to live?

160
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,129
Then just take some time off.

161
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,120
Be honest with me.

162
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,628
Did you and Picha have a fight,
or are you seeing someone else?

163
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,653
What?

164
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't even think about it.

165
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,543
Picha is like a little sister to me.

166
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,750
No, no, it's not like that at all.

167
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,960
You know, I never asked.

168
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,960
How did you and Picha... get so close?

169
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I just realized,

170
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,390
you two have been close for a long time.

171
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,363
When I was a rookie,

172
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
a little girl...

173
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,183
gave me 100 baht.

174
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,583
Please kill him for me.

175
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,116
If it's not enough, I'll get you more.

176
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,756
But the bill... was torn in half.

177
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,156
She said it was payment for me
to catch the man who hurt her.

178
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,876
And did you?

179
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,256
Yeah.

180
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,410
He went to jail, and after he got out,
he was killed.

181
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,816
Go back and take good care of Picha.

182
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,229
I love that kid, and I'm worried about her.

183
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,737
But...

184
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,116
since you're the one who got her pregnant...

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,049
A toast to my new brother-in-law.

189
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,720
Cheers.

190
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,036
I thought you were going to punch me.

If you're so close to Picha,

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,016
how come you never ate
at Grandma Anong's diner?

Well...

Hey, I was just a rookie back then.

199

- That's just sad.
- Last night,

200
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
police received a report from local residents

201
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,680
that Dr. Aekpong was found dead
from a self-inflicted gunshot wound

202
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,800
in a hospital restroom.

203
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,560
The body had a single gunshot wound
to the head.

204
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,680
The cause is believed to be extreme stress,

205
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,996
allegedly linked to a drug
procurement corruption scandal at the hospital,

206
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:34,400
with clear evidence suggesting his involvement

207
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,243
throughout his entire career at the hospital.

208
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:39,043
Excellent.

209
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:41,763
Be careful over there.

Don't let anyone find you.

211
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:58,240
I bet Dr. Aekpong was involved in this case.

212
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,936
How do you know? You have proof?

213
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,596
No. Just a gut feeling.

She was only my mother for a single day,

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,936
I became a reporter because...

enough to want to kill me--

Then tell me.

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,163
- What did you do?
- If I could tell you, I'd have a long time ago.

331
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,163
You killed Sangchai.

332
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,623

And?

335
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:11,123
That son of a bitch... deserved to die anyway.

336
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:19,950
Regardless of the reason,

337
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,943
it doesn't change the fact that I'm a murderer.

338
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,110

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,830
- and finds out their father is a murderer?
- I don't care.

349

No matter what happens,

350
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,283

- Go get an abortion!

- You can just leave!
- Go get an abortion!

00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,156
This isn't about whether or not
you can raise a child.

When he is born,

360
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,970

as the child of a murderer.

00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,564
Go get an abortion.

367
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:26,463
Go get an abortion.

368
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:27,800
Wit!

369
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,544
Go get an abortion!

370
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,783
Wit...

371
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:15,190
[Sweet Dreams Hotel]

372
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,463
Who is it?

373
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,383
It's me.

374
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:11,576
It's unlocked. Come on in.

375
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:22,663
Hey, where's Wit?

376
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:24,680
We broke up.

377
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,480
What?

378
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,584
He told me to go get an abortion.

379
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:31,595
I'm going to go talk to him.

380
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:34,329
- It's no use.
- You wait here. I'll be right back.

381
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:35,840
Are you even human?

382
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,584
That's your child! You got her pregnant,

383
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,144
and now you're telling her
to go get an abortion?

384
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,996
I don't know!

385
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,256
I don't even know what I am anymore, Captain.

386
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:13,024
If I don't make it,

387
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:18,823
please promise me
you'll take care of Picha and my child.

388
00:45:18,823 --> 00:45:21,463
Why are you talking like that?

389
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:23,184
What the hell is wrong with you?

390
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:26,016
I don't know what's wrong with me either.

391
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:30,363
I don't have much time left.

392
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:38,010
And there are still so many things
I need to do.

393
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,043
Then why don't you go see a doctor?

394
00:45:51,704 --> 00:45:55,323
No doctor can help me now.

395
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:57,383
I've already been.

396
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:59,443
I went to see one.

397
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:02,240
There's nothing they can do for me.

398
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,029
Listen to me.

399
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:07,876
Let's just say...

400
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,556
you really knew you were dying.

401
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:16,920
You should spend the time you have left
with the people you love.

402
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,720
Wouldn't that be better?

403
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,663
I didn't mean to say those things to her.

404
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:47,343
I'm just afraid she won't be able
to make it on her own.

405
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,680
Captain.

406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,800
Captain,

407
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,530
can you take me home?

408
00:47:35,382 --> 00:47:37,182
Let's go.

409
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,476
All right, everyone, let's break for lunch.

410
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,920
Make sure you eat up.

411
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,670
We're not done yet.

412
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:01,144
Tomorrow at 5 a.m.

413
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,230
5 a.m.?

414
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,690
What about the director?
I thought he said we couldn't air this.

415
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:54,680
You all right?

416
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,703
I'll be okay. Thanks, Captain.

417
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,498
What is all this?

418
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,360
It's a baby crib.

419
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,750
I was planning on... finishing it today.

420
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:51,432
Come on.

421
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,958
Let's finish it.

422
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,160
Captain...

423
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,960
Come on.

424
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:54,016
I can handle the rest.

425
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,371
Hand it over.

426
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:00,171
Thanks.

427
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,263
You know, I'm really happy.

428
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,823
Just like that, I'm going to be an uncle.

429
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:13,352
Wit.

430
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:17,120
Next time you're about to make a big decision,

431
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,920
think it through first, all right?

432
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,530
I'll go get Picha and bring her back.

433
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,032
You two take care of each other.

434
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:34,191
I will.

435
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,770
Picha.

436
00:52:12,444 --> 00:52:14,244
Picha.

437
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:44,352
Let's go home.

438
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:23,472
Let's go.

439
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:51,111
If I don't make it,

440
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:57,000
please promise me
you'll take care of Picha and my child.

441
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,600
Why are you talking like that?

442
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,552
What the hell is wrong with you?

443
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:04,310
I don't know what's wrong with me either.

444
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:08,883
I don't have much time left.

445
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:23,200
Picha.

446
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,320
I brought you some food. Are you hungry?

447
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,552
Picha?

448
00:54:44,272 --> 00:54:46,072
Picha!

449
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,320
[Don't worry about me.
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.]

450
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,203
We're sorry, the number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

451
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:52,415
- Have you eaten yet?
- Hello.

452
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:53,440
- Come on,
- Hello, Aunty.

453
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,240
Sit with us.

454
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:59,072
- Please.
- Thank you.

455
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:01,990
Stay for dinner. I'll get you a plate.

456
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:12,271
Aunty.

457
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
Let's eat.

458
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,440
Manager?

459
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,511
I'm here to resign.

460
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:58,383
Here's my employee ID and the motorcycle key.

461
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,960
And my uniform.

462
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,880
Are you sure? You could keep it
in case you want to come back.

463
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,910
I don't think I'll be coming back.

464
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:14,720
Is it possible...
to transfer my final paycheck today?

465
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,056
And my security deposit as well, please.

466
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:20,880
I can't do it today,

467
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,990
but I can transfer it later, okay?

468
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,956
All right. Please do it as soon as you can.

469
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:32,258
Is everything okay?

470
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,152
I have to go now.

471
00:59:41,152 --> 00:59:43,560
Hey, call me if you need anything.

472
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,360
Okay.

473
01:00:10,192 --> 01:00:12,712
Oh, my dear. Don't be afraid.

474
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,672
Come on, come with grandma.

475
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:17,280
That's it, let's go.

476
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,436
Don't be scared, child. I'm right here.

477
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:01,872
Come on.

478
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:17,831
Let's go.

479
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,730
Hey, Picha.

480
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:24,231
Picha.

481
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,280
See? There was nothing to be afraid of.

482
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,800
You can get through this.

483
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,840
When I was a cadet,
we had class on the weekends.

484
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,123
There would be hundreds of girls
lined up just to see us.

485
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:10,903
No matter what happens,

486
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,341
you have to continue being
the good police officer you've always been.

487
01:04:16,341 --> 01:04:17,597
When we first started dating,

488
01:04:17,597 --> 01:04:20,458
we planned to meet at the movies.
Guess what happened?

489
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,363
I went to the wrong theater.

490
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:24,831
I made trouble on our very first date.

491
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:29,010
I'm sure that you'll choose to do
the right thing.

492
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Thank you so much, Uncle.

493
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:48,123
No, thank you for making my wife so happy.

494
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:54,399
I'll see you again soon.

495
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,671
Hello?

496
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,884
How are you feeling?

497
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:36,684
The same as always.

498
01:05:39,404 --> 01:05:41,204
Have you taken your medicine?

499
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,250
Tomorrow's the day, right?

500
01:05:46,431 --> 01:05:48,600
Yes.

501
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,870
Tomorrow, everyone will finally know...

502
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,490
that Dr. Kan wasn't the killer.

503
01:06:45,311 --> 01:06:50,391
We won't be promoting this special episode
ahead of time.

504
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:53,072
We'll have several special guests,

505
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:56,829
some here in the studio and some calling in.

506
01:06:57,831 --> 01:07:01,083
I need everyone on standby at all times.

507
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,363
What happens if the guests
we invited don't show up?

508
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,560
Oh, they'll be here.

509
01:07:17,991 --> 01:07:19,585
All right, everyone.

510
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:21,019
Let's get ready.

511
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:23,656
Let's get ready, everyone.

512
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,623
Hey, Ya.

513
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,720
Yes, Riew?

514
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,720
No matter what happens,

515
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,723
give it your all.

516
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,389
If I lose my job over this, so be it.

517
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,863
I trust you.

518
01:07:50,671 --> 01:07:52,471
Thank you so much.

519
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,503
Have you ever heard of
an organization called OZ?

520
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:05,056
When Kan was a child, he never showed
any signs of violence.

521
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:09,069
I'm afraid my child
will have the psychopath gene, just like me.

522
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:11,920
Our child will grow up to be a good person.
I'm sure of it.

523
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,243
I'm ready to expose everything.

524
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,520
Cut the feed from the M News Station.

525
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,960
Break down the door.

526
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,943
Shut down the broadcast now.

527
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,880
The Prime Minister ordered the feed to be cut.

528
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,400
But they're still on the air.

529
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,970
This is the police!
What the hell are you doing?

530
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:38,002
I'll kill you.

531
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,680
I'll fucking kill you!
