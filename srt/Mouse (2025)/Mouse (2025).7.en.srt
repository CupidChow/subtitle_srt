00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
Because Captain Ramil, who has been
on this case from the start,

116
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,280

then the other one must be the killer, right?

137
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:02,480
- Exactly.
- How do you explain that?

138
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840

we will release it to the public.

143
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,040
If the investigation results are confirmed,

144
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,760
what policies will be put in place to screen
people applying to work at the hospital?

145
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,800

- Yes.

160
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,880
Does it hurt?

161
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,000
The test shows he could be in the one percent.

162
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,520
Will he change when he grows up?

163
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,120
If we raise him well,
he'll stay in that one percent forever.

164
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm sure.

165
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
He won't turn bad.

166
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,280
I think so too.

167
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,960
The patient is now stable,

168
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,440

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll be a good girl.

184
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,480
I won't cause her any more trouble.

185
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,960
I don't know who to turn to.

186
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,520
I don't know what to do.

187
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,120
I don't even know what's going on.

188
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,840
Please save my grandma.

189
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,759
Mil.

190
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Tell me, what really happened?

191
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm going to kill that doctor.

192
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
I'm going to kill him.

193
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
Wait. Where are you going?

194
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
I'm going to kill that doctor.

195
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,160
Calm down. You can't just do that.

196
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,640
If it were you, what would you do?

197
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,100
What really happened?

198
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Why did this have to happen to Grandma and Wit?

199
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,040
What really happened?

200
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,280
I don't know either.

201
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,760
But Grandma must've known something.

202
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,520
Captain, the Chief wants you back at HQ.

203
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Don't do anything reckless, understand?

204
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,680
The most important thing is
to take care of grandma

205
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
and get her to wake up.

206
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Understand?

207
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's go.

208
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
His brain is severely damaged.

209
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Without immediate surgery,
things won't look good.

210
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,040
That's right, Doctor.

211
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,040
Have you eaten anything yet?

212
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,520
I can't eat.

213
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,600
I know you're worried about grandma,

214
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,360
but you have to take care of yourself too.

215
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:26,040
If you fall ill, it'll be tough on both of you.

216
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Okay.

217
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,160
Visiting hours are over for today.

218
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,160
Go get some rest.

219
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
Can I stay here and watch over Grandma?

220
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Please.

221
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's the hospital's rules.

222
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Fine, ten more minutes.

223
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,320
Thank you.

224
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Kan.

225
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:11,406
Kan, you're awake?

226
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:13,139
Kan.

227
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Can you hear me?

228
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,160
Let me go get the doctor.

229
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Kan.

230
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
He woke up just now.

231
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Really?

232
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,153
I'll go get the doctor.

233
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Yes.

234
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Kan.

235
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Kan.

236
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,800
I have no idea what happened.

237
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,720
My mind is full of questions.

238
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,040
But no matter what,
I'll help you get the answers.

239
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Please wake up soon, Kan.

240
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,440
He moved a little just now, Doctor.

241
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,560
Excuse me, I'll check on the patient.

242
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Please help.

243
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,200
Chanya, what's wrong?

244
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,320
You overexerted yourself.

245
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
You're pregnant.

246
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,560
No food, no sleep, and you'll collapse.

247
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:01,577
Here.

248
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,480
Have something sweet. Your blood sugar's low.

249
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,886
You haven't eaten all day, right?

250
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,159
I ordered hospital food for you.

251
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:15,826
Eat and rest, okay?

252
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,127
Thanks, Kwang.

253
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,640
Take care of yourself, bestie.

254
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,280
I worry about you.

255
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah, I know.

256
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,159
Rest well.

257
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:44,346
The X-ray shows a skull fracture.

258
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,280
Swelling in the frontal lobe
and multiple brain hemorrhages.

259
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,960
He's in critical condition.

260
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,520
Will he survive?

261
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,080
I've contacted a friend in the U.S.
to fly over.

262
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,640
He's quite skilled.

263
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,040
Can he wait until then?

264
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm also worried the patient
won't be able to hold on.

265
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,960
Oh, I remember now.

266
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,840
There's another doctor
who could take this case.

267
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Who?

268
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,920
How are you feeling?

269
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,600
Does it hurt anywhere?

270
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,440
I just went to the bathroom.

271
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,640
Go home.

272
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,840
Get some rest.

273
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:11,747
I'll see you tomorrow.

274
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,679
No.

275
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,880
You're really not going back?

276
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:14,726
Fine.

277
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,800
Just five more minutes, okay?

278
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,830
It's so warm.

279
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,730
- It's warm.
- Sleep.

280
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,100
- Too warm.
- I can't take it anymore.

281
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,630
What are we going to do, bro?

282
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,880
Everyone! Sleep!

283
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,880
- Sleep, sleep.
- Sleep.

284
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
- I'm sleeping.
- Sleep, sleep.

285
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,700
I'm sleeping now.

286
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,300
- Yes, go to sleep.
- How is it?

287
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,950
I'll put some drops
on your tongue if you snore.

288
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,960
Can't sleep.

289
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,360
- Someone's here to see you.
- Hey.

290
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
What do you want?

291
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Here's the information and evidence
collected from the scene.

292
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
Have you gotten any sleep?

293
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,106
Would you be able to sleep?

294
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,760
Show him.

295
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,520
Here are the call logs
for all three numbers. Here.

296
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,720
Dr. Kan called Grandma Anong.

297
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,280
Then she called Wit,
all within a short timeframe.

298
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,840
This is Dr. Kan's car GPS route.

299
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,960
And here's the street cam footage.

300
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,840
It shows Wit driving to the old neighborhood.

301
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,720
From the evidence I collected,

302
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,720
it makes a strong case
that Dr. Kan is the Gold Leaf Killer.

303
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,640
While we were waiting for forensics,

304
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,880
I was keeping watch on Kan's place.

305
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,520
As I waited for Dr. Kan,

306
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,520
Grandma Anong rushed out. She looked anxious.

307
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,880
I assumed she'd found some evidence.

308
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,640
So I followed Dr. Kan.

309
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,800
From Grandma Anong's calls,

310
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,040
she likely asked Wit for help.

311
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,680
Hello.

312
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,360
I'm almost there.

313
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Wit, hurry up. I'm scared.

314
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,800
Okay, okay, okay.

315
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,480
But once she realized Dr. Kan was tailing her,

316
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,720
she hid and waited for Wit.

317
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,880
But he found her first

318
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,200
and attacked her to take back the evidence.

319
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:11,193
Do you want to know who I am before you die?

320
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,200
Dr. Kan.

321
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,760
Dr. Kan.

322
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,840
Please, don't hurt me.

323
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,840
Please don't.

324
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,960
I'm scared.

325
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,160
Look at me.

326
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,520
I'm scared.

327
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm really scared.

328
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,880
When Wit arrived
and saw Grandma Anong attacked,

329
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,200
he rushed in to help.

330
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,000
The gunshot led me to Grandma Anong.

331
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,520
When I found her, she was barely alive.

332
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Grandma.

333
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,240
PM's son, call the emergency team
to the old neighborhood.

334
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,680
Someone's injured. Send backup.

335
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,000
I followed the trail and found Dr. Kan,

336
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,120
attacking Wit violently.

337
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,400
So I shot him.

338
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:18,237
That crazy boy...

339
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,350
didn't tell anyone
and went after him by himself.

340
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,480
This photo could be key evidence
linking the victims to Dr. Kan.

341
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,200
But all of that... is just your assumption.

342
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,880
No one knows the truth.

343
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Besides,

344
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,880
none of them are in a state
to give a statement right now.

345
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,200
We'll have to wait for someone
to wake up first.

346
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Yes.

347
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,240
Yes, yes. I'll go now.

348
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,240
Doctor, what's happening?

349
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,400
Wit, wit!

350
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,825
Doctor, what's happening to him?

351
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:33,905
The patient's condition is critical,
we need to operate immediately.

352
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:36,040
- Then--
- I can't answer anything right now.

353
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,000
Captain, what should we do?

354
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
What are you doing here?

355
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,760
I was ordered to guard
all patients in this case.

356
00:51:58,432 --> 00:51:59,432
What about their families?

357
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,800
I don't know. I didn't see anyone
when I got there.

358
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,560
Wait! Where are you going?

359
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,760
I'm going to kill that doctor.

360
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,120
Calm down! You can't just do that.

361
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,800
If it were you, what would you do?

362
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,480
Dr. Kan.

363
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,440
Dr. Kan.

364
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,720
Don't hurt me.

365
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,760
Kan.

366
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
Nurse,

367
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,560
where did the patient in this room go?

368
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,800
I'm not sure. I just started my shift.

369
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,320
He might've been taken for tests.

370
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,440
Let me check.

371
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Thank you.

372
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,000
Alright, I'll head down.

373
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,080
I'd like to give you an update
on the patients' condition.

374
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,440
After several surgeries,

375
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Sergeant Patcharawit
and Ms. Anong are now stable.

376
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,200
Oh, thank goodness.

377
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:05,899
Mom.

378
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,160
However, their bodies remain unresponsive
to external stimuli.

379
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,400
We cannot confirm
whether they will return to normal.

380
00:56:24,726 --> 00:56:26,606
Doctor, what about Dr. Kan?

381
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:33,726
Dr. Kankavin has passed away.

382
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Is that true?

383
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,400
Did you get in a fight with a dog or something?

384
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,280
Why so rude, Doc?

385
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,980
It's nothing serious.

386
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,480
Ugh!

387
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,200
Afraid I'll get sick?

388
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,280
No.

389
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,120
I'm just scared no one will feed me anymore.

390
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,800
I saw you at the hospital.

391
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,600
So I secretly peeked at your records.

392
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,960
That's cheating.

393
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,600
Let's name the baby.

394
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,760
Kawinchaya.

395
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,160
You're really not going back?

396
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:10,253
Fine.

397
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,280
Just five more minutes.

398
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,560
I have no idea what happened.

399
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,280
My mind is full of questions.

400
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,240
But no matter what,
I'll help you get the answers.

401
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,640
Please wake up soon, Kan.

402
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,320
Eat. It's still hot.

403
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,760
Eat up so you'll stay strong.

404
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,600
Go back to school.
You've missed school for days.

405
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,280
You'll get expelled.

406
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,720
But Grandma is still...

407
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,760
What you're doing doesn't help Grandma at all.

408
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,320
Let the doctors take care of it.

409
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,780
But you...

410
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,750
need to keep living.

411
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,430
Help me!

412
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,900
Somebody, help!

413
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,040
Doctor, the patient is awake!

414
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,120
All change comes with conflict.

415
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,440
Those who have never lost anything
will never understand.

416
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,680
I lost my child because of them.

417
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,520
Why did you let them out?

418
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,200
Feels good, doesn't it?

419
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,300
[Restricted area]

420
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:27,160
Lieutenant Patcharawit will serve
as a model officer in Maga One City.

421
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,560
Nice to meet you.

422
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:34,803
[I came back to this house, but it feels strange.
It doesn't feel like my own home.]

423
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,200
Grandma, I'm sorry.

424
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,920
I wish I could've helped you more.

425
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Grandma!
