Good evening. Recently, the term "amnesty"
has been in the headlines,

30
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,460
referring to the release of prisoners.

31

Stay tuned for our special report
on this topic.

[Amnesty or Bad Karma?]

33
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,500
The prisoner was convicted of raping
and murdering his victim.

34
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,300
Consequently, he was sentenced to death.

35
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
The death sentence was later commuted
to life imprisonment.

36
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,740
However, he was released
from prison under amnesty.

37
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:40,275
Why didn't they let me out too, huh?

38
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,100
The prisoner was arrested for raping
and sexually assaulting a girl under 13.

39
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,100
He received just a 20-year prison sentence
and was released together with the others.

40
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,540
Many prisoners sentenced to death
were not executed,

41
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,500
and their sentences were reduced
to life imprisonment instead.

by this 'simplistic understanding'?

linking them to rape and murder, not just once.

77
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,820

don't you think it's only right?

Instant noodles again?
Spent your paycheck already?

545
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,425
My paycheck's too small.

546
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,740
I don't hire ex-cons.

547
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,700
Where have you ever seen them hire ex-cons?

548
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,260
How are you so sure he's a killer?

549
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,500
My instinct.

550
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,775
Get out of the car!

551
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:16,860
[Community Development Area 2]

552
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,300
We need to give wrongdoers a chance!

553
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,780
What if someone in your family got killed?
Would you still say that?

554
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,940
We'll probably have to postpone
the amnesty law for now,

555
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,020
before things get out of hand.

556
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,140
If we keep flip-flopping, people will lose
even more faith in the Prime Minister.

557
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,580
The intention was to make the city
free of crime.

558
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,180
You said you'd take care of Picha,

559
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,540
can't you even do that?

560
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,700
Don't be scared.

561
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,175
[Sangchai]

562
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,660
The victim was stabbed.

563
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,300
Whoever did this isn't just an ordinary person.

564
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,940
The genitals were cut off.

565
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,860
It makes me think of a psychopath.

566
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,100
These prisoners have been released.

567
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,980
If you don't want to be used, drop this case.

568
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,780
The package you ordered has arrived.

569
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,300
I got my revenge.

570
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,020
If it means going to jail,

571
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,780
I'm not afraid.
