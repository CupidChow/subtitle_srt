Whatever you're planning to do,

6
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,636
I'm not getting involved with this anymore.

7
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,680
You've been in this since day one.

8
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm thinking of finding a small plot of land
for the three of us.

9
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,720
For you and our baby.

10
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,800
If we can be together here,

11
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,240
it would be great.

12
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,296
Do you really think

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,890
you can live...

14
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,560
a peaceful life?

15
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
Psychopaths are dangerous,

16
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,160
they must be eliminated from society.

17
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't know what happened.

18
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm lost. Everything's confusing.

19
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,220
How did the killer know Lieutenant Shin
was working on it?

20
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,020
I don't get it.

21
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,800
An insider.

22
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,960
He collected data from that boy
right before he resigned.

23
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,133
Hey, Picha!

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,120
[Peaceful Society Association]
Why do you want to work at this foundation?

25
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,080
I want to help care for kids
abandoned by their families.

26
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
Karan, you'll stay with me.

27
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,760
Whether it was intentional or not.

28
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,950
Don't be afraid.

29
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,760
This place is your home now.

30
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,064
That's why I want to take care
of these children.

31
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:17,089
I think this place...

32
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,920
Hello.

33
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,496
This place is an organization
that helps people contribute to society.

34
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Uncle Dumrong.

35
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,880
So I want to be part of this organization too.

36
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,920
I had an older sister. She was a reporter.

37
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,280
She'd leave for work in the morning
and come home late.

38
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,760
It was like that every day.

39
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,375
But one day, she never came back.

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
If it weren't for them,

41
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,975
I think everyone
would have made it home safely.

42
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,160
He collected data from that boy
right before he resigned.

43
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,376
- Hey.
- Hey.

44
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,583
- I need to check some records real quick.
- Go ahead, man.

45
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
What are you looking for?

46
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
The family murder case from 15 years ago.

47
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
- 15 years?
- Yes.

48
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,743
Darn, that was ages ago.

49
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,243
But the statute of limitations isn't up yet.

50
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,360
- Hey, don't touch! The gun might go off.
- No, can I touch it?

51
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
- No, no.
- No, I want to see.

52
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,691
- But you're a cop.
- Don't touch a cop's gun, got it?

53
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,953
Eh, but I want to see.

54
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,800
This is called a revolver...
why are you asking?

55
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,650
Hey! What's going on over there?

56
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,196
Officer, don't carry a gun to the school
next time.

57
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm sorry.

58
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,960
How can I help you?

59
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm looking into a former student.
He studied here.

60
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,200
What's his name?

61
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,076
Karan Singsathapakorn.

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,543
The kid who threw an eraser at your head.

63
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,280
Ouch.

64
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,390
Hey, pay attention!

65
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,200
And return the eraser to me.

66
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,639
Oh, is there something?

67
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,840
What was he like?

68
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,640
He was like a wall.

69
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,086
Whatever you gave him, he gave it right back.

70
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,886
So...

71
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,743
it's like an eye for an eye?

72
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,280
You can say that.

73
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,352
Let the good be truly good.

74
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,160
Let the wicked be utterly wicked.

75
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,440
Give back what was done to you.

76
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,760
You threw it first, so I threw it back.

77
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,440
If you apologize to me first,
then I'll apologize back.

78
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,256
And then we're even.

79
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,540
Looking back,

80
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,400
it wasn't his fault. It was mine.

81
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,640
What was his personality like?

82
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,320
He was a strange kid.

83
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,520
He did strange things, and sometimes creepy.

84
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,416
He once brought a knife
and slaughtered a chicken,

85
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,510
just to see how it laid eggs.

86
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,760
Did he have any friends?

87
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,083
The kids were scared of him
and kept their distance.

88
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
But...

89
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,240
I've seen one boy who used to talk
and hang out with him.

90
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,336
Do you remember that boy's name?

91
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
No, sorry. But he was in another class.

92
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
His personality was just as strange as Karan's.

93
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,196
He was... emotionless.

94
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,003
Do you have their current addresses on record?

95
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
- Hello.
- How can I help you?

96
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
I'm a police officer.

97
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,556
I'm looking for someone who lived here.
This is a photo of him as a child.

98
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Does he look familiar?

99
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,016
I've never seen him before.

100
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Not at all?

101
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,236
- No.
- She wouldn't know anything. She just moved in.

102
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,080
Thank you.

103
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,120
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm a police officer.

104
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm looking for someone who used to live here.

105
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,176
This is him as a kid.

106
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,406
Oh, this boy?

107
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:24,200
- Yes.
- Someone came and got him a long time ago.

108
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,056
I heard it was his aunt.

109
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,763
- His aunt?
- Yes.

110
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,243
Any updates?

111
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,456
Are you asking about me?

112
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,843
I've been keeping an eye
on your condition all along,

113
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,243
and it gradually became clear.

114
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,783
After reading Dr. Aekpong's report,

115
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,243
I'm even more convinced.

116
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,680
Convinced about what?

117
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,936
Your body is rejecting the new brain
that was transplanted into you.

118
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,280
What are you saying?

119
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,936
I'm saying your brain transplant didn't work.

120
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,095
I've seen this pattern before in lab rats.

121
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,435
You don't have much time left.

122
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,625
You shouldn't be alone.

123
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll be fine.

124
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,023
Don't be stubborn. Stay with me. It's safer.

125
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,256
Do you have feelings for Picha?

126
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,120
I think I like her.

127
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,320
I promise I'll take good care of her.

128
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,120
I...

129
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,920
I like you, Picha.

130
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,790
I'm thinking of finding a small plot of land

131
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,273
for the three of us.

132
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,840
For you and our baby.

133
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,683
I don't care where we live
as long as we're together.

134
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm pregnant.

135
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,869
Do you think the child will turn out like us?

136
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,040
How long...

137
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,176
do I have left?

138
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,090
Who did this to me?

139
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,570
Who did this to me?

140
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,328
Who?

141
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,696
Who was it?

142
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,444
Who?

143
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,725
I'm asking you, who was it?

144
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
Bussarin.

145
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,560
Bussarin?

146
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm sorry.

147
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,120
Mom.

148
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Mom.

149
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,425
Mom!

150
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,016
You don't have much time left.

151
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,356
If you want to do it, do it now.

152
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,440
Whatever you want to do, do it fast.

153
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,130
Hello, Chanya.

154
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,160
Is there any way I could meet Bussarin?

155
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Not long after his sister died,

156
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,320
he started volunteering at the association.

157
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,640
Hello. How can I help you?

158
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes,

159
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,199
I heard your organization
offers scholarships to students?

160
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:13,906
- That's right.
- I want to apply for my son's scholarship.

161
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:16,023
What grade is he in?

162
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,400
He's in Grade 10.

163
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,440
We only offer scholarships for Grades 9 and 12,

164
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,570
so your child isn't eligible.

165
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,120
Oh, really?

166
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,760
Can I still apply? Do you have the form?

167
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,676
- Sure, please wait a moment.
- Okay, thank you.

168
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,416
Here's the form. Complete it
and return it with the documents.

169
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,550
- Yes.
- Officer.

170
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,640
Yes.

171
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,910
- Thank you.
- Yes.

172
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,576
Couldn't you think of a better excuse?

173
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Grade 10, seriously?

174
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,360
Hello, I'm at the foundation.
Found something interesting.

175
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,475
Meet me at our usual spot.

176
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840
Okay.

177
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,280
What is this?

178
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,120
Peaceful Society Association.

179
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,840
And?

180
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,920
It's where the Gold Leaf Killer started.

181
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,200
The first victim was Chuto,

182
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,720
so I traced it back there.

183
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,865
Chuto used to be a volunteer here.

184
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:43,705
His job was filming the kids' behavior.

185
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,320
That's it?

186
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,800
At first, I thought
it was just standard behavior tracking,

187
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,920
since they provided scholarships and all.

188
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,375
But after I saw the footage myself...

189
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,600
Wasn't that normal? They offered scholarships,
so they followed up on the kids.

190
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,840
But he was monitoring every day,

191
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,000
and he was assigned to track
the behavior of this kid, Karan.

192
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,585
The kid's behavior was odd.

193
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,726
Then his whole family was murdered.

194
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,133
Everyone died,

195
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,600
except Karan.

196
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,760
He's the only one who survived.

197
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,445
Later, a relative took him in.

198
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,430
So you think
he's somehow connected to this kid.

199
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,680
There was never a suspect in this case.

200
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,480
I thought this boy could lead me somewhere,

201
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,120
but all records of him,
name, ID, everything, were erased.

202
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,930
Even the relative who took him in
has no records.

203
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,235
And after the murders, Chuto resigned.

204
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,360
Didn't the killer mention Chuto's guilt?

205
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,400
That he caused someone's death,

206
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,323
and that the wounds were inflicted out
of revenge.

207
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,200
Chuto could have known

208
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,600
about Karan's family's murder.

209
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,423
And when Karan... grew up,

210
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,390
he came back for revenge.

211
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,040
There's a real chance Karan...

212
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,520
is the real Gold Leaf Killer.

213
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,360
Wait, is that a guess, or do you have evidence?

214
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
In police terms, it's a hypothesis.

215
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,146
Is it a presumption or just a hunch?

216
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:35,320
Like last time, the Five Precepts thing...

217
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,249
- you couldn't even get them all right--
- That's why I'm starting over again.

218
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,003
I want to find out
what the PM's aide was doing here, too.

219
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,880
Fine. Just send me those photos.

220
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,056
- That's all?
- Yes.

221
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,923
Wait, what?

222
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,530
[To: Ms. Chanya Praephatthapong,
M News Station]

223
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,030
Say hi to the viewers at home.

224
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,440
Plawan!

225
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,043
I want to go home!

226
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,760
Two years after a boy named Plawan disappeared

227
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,680
in the Gold Leaf Killer Case,

228
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,853
his body was anonymously shipped to M News.

229
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:07,280
Reporter Chanya received the package herself,

230
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,120
and it appeared to be Plawan's frozen body.

231
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,720
The sender's identity remains unknown.

232
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,400
Authorities had found no trace of the boy
in the two years since his disappearance.

233
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,960
It's believed he was assaulted
by the Gold Leaf Killer,

234
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,360
rendered unconscious,

235
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,040
and preserved in a freezer.

236
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,160
Chief Banjong Chanasittha

237
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,760
has launched a special task force,

238
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,587
scouring CCTV footage and searching for clues.

239
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:44,200
He has vowed

240
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,710
to bring the perpetrator
to justice as swiftly as possible--

241
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,573
This news is tanking
the government's approval rating.

242
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:57,253
If it keeps up,

243
00:31:57,253 --> 00:32:01,006
we won't survive the next election.

244
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,776
It's actually more beneficial for us.

245
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:10,270
Most MPs are leaning
toward supporting the bill.

246
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,290
Headlines like this will hasten their decision.

247
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,496
Why is this Psychopathic Abortion Bill
so important to you?

248
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,640
The defendant is guilty of murder,

249
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,060
but due to mental incapacity,

250
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,163
the act was under diminished responsibility.

251
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,627
Standard sentencing...

252
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:45,403
cannot be applied.

253
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,400
Therefore, capital punishment is waived,

254
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,533
and the defendant...

255
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:55,360
is sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.

256
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,040
- Hey, how can you do that?
- Yes, what is it?

257
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,400
He took someone's life!

258
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,080
Order in the court.

259
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,263
A crime-free city was my father's dream.

260
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,240
I intend to make it real myself.

261
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,096
While we wait for the vote,

262
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,276
perhaps you could invite
the senators to dinner.

263
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,200
I've kept all five precepts,
and my theory was right.

264
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,680
Precept one: Do not kill living beings.

265
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,126
The verdict has been passed. Please, sit.

266
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,806
Precept two: Do not take what is not given.

267
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,403
My mum taught me not to take things
that don't belong to us.

268
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,480
I'll spill the names of everyone you sold to!

269
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,200
Precept three: No sexual misconduct.

270
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,973
It was my fault, sir.

271
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:07,100
Precept four: Do not lie.

272
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,240
Wit, stay out of this.

273
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,560
Just punish me.

274
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,440
I saw your anti-drug and alcohol signs
around the neighborhood.

275
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,120
You'll regret crossing me.

276
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,840
Precept five: No alcohol or intoxicants.

277
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,440
What's next?

278
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,640
Have you looked into Bussarin's ties to
the Peaceful Society Association?

279
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,570
Not yet, but I've got an interview with her.

280
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,920
We searched Dr. Aekpong's office
but found nothing.

281
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,560
- But...
- But what?

282
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,440
CCTV caught Wit sneaking in.

283
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,023
But there's nothing in his room.

284
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,303
Could Dr. Aekpong have taken it too?

285
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,823
- Find Aekpong and take care of him.
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,880
Why would they send me the body?

287
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,970
I think they're after publicity.

288
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,640
That's possible.

289
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,210
I have a hunch... they're after something else.

290
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,790
So it wasn't the killer's doing, then.

291
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,603
I can't figure out why, either.

292
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,260
Either way, it's key evidence
that Dr. Kan isn't the Gold Leaf Killer.

293
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,863
Only the real killer would know
where the body was hidden.

294
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,760
You're kind of contradictory, you know.

295
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,867
You said only the killer could remove the body.

296
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:29,120
Now you're saying only the killer
would know where it was hidden. What?

297
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,400
Honestly, I'm so lost.

298
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,016
And I have to fix the past,
make the case right.

299
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:42,280
I'll have to start the investigation
over from the beginning.

300
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,270
Back to the beginning again.

301
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,720
You should be careful.

302
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,643
Don't take risks unless necessary.

303
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,669
You keep asking me to meet like this.
What do you want?

304
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,160
Come on.

305
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
You said you wanted insider info, right?

306
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
You could've just called.

307
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,146
Look, we're here already. Just eat.

308
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:20,530
Come on, I can't finish it all by myself.

309
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,770
Delicious?

310
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,130
Ouch, hot.

311
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,843
- Hello.
- Hello, Doctor.

312
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,920
Doctor,

313
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,080
how much time...

314
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,600
do I have left?

315
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,400
What are you going to do?

316
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,200
I...

317
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,750
There's something I want to do before I die.

318
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,040
What are you planning to do?
Don't do anything to Bussarin.

319
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,583
If you do it, you'll end up dead in prison.

320
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,840
Honestly, I don't even know...

321
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,640
if I can do it.

322
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
What do you need from me?

323
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,343
Can I get a stronger prescription?

324
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,080
I'll see what I can do.

325
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,240
Thank you.

326
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,496
That year, 28 children with
the psychopathy gene were born and not aborted.

327
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,545
From 28, the number has decreased
over the years.

328
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,160
Subjects 22 and 23...

329
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,510
were taken for extended testing,
lasting longer than the others.

330
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,000
What kind of testing?

331
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,600
The tests were designed
to stimulate their psychopathy

332
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,163
to turn them into criminals.

333
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,640
Human trials like that are illegal
and unethical.

334
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,816
But they took my research
and continued it secretly.

335
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,030
Who's behind all this?

336
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,150
I've managed to schedule
a meeting with Bussarin.

337
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,800
This is all you've got?

338
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,950
So what does this association
have to do with the case?

339
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,960
So Chuto,

340
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,520
the first victim of the Gold Leaf Killer,
used to work here when he was young.

341
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,020
So it's connected to
the Gold Leaf Killer case again?

342
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,680
Of course it is.

343
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,160
The Gold Leaf Killer
and the person hunting ex-convicts are the same.

344
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,363
We have to go back to the beginning,
the first victim, and everything connected.

345
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,683
I've been there. Something feels off.
Suspicious things are going on.

346
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,170
Is the PM's advisor in the photo
involved in this?

347
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,840
Not sure yet.

348
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,040
But from the photo,

349
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,863
she seems to be the chairwoman
of this association.

350
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,320
- Adisak.
- Yes, Captain.

351
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,840
Find out all you can about that advisor

352
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,200
and her ties to this association.

353
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,000
Yes.

354
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,400
Tawee.

355
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,843
Come out here and talk to me.

356
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,483
What is it, Captain?

357
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,825
It's you.

358
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,843
- What?
- You're with OZ, aren't you?

359
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,920
I asked if you're one of them. I have proof.

360
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,610
I was just hired for security.

361
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,240
You think that's funny?

362
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,223
- Ramil.
- Hey, Captain.

363
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,120
Hey, Tawee.

364
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,960
What are you talking about?

365
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,320
I suspect he's with the OZ,
digging into our confidential info,

366
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,790
and covering for them.

367
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,650
I got the OZZI tattoo
because I like the singer.

368
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,090
Don't make me find out what you're doing.

369
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,689
What the hell is going on between you two? Huh?

370
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,213
Look at this.

371
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:22,720
You see?

372
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,400
There are OZ operatives
all over that association.

373
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,030
I'm afraid Tawee might be one of them.

374
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,990
He said he was hired. He already told me.

375
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,816
Why are you like this?

376
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,536
Can I trust you?

377
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,600
Of course.

378
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,010
Then help me keep an eye on Tawee.

379
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,876
- What?
- Hey, Wit.

380
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,723
Did you get hit, too?

381
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,880
- No, it's nothing, Captain.
- Why is your nose bleeding?

382
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,760
Here's a gel pack.

383
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,743
Must be the heat, Captain.

384
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,080
Thank you.

385
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,440
Should you go see a doctor?

386
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,425
I already went. The doctor said
it'll get better gradually.

387
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,710
For now, help me keep an eye on Tawee.

388
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,720
You're overthinking.

389
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,520
It's a gut feeling.

Hey,

392
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,396
Wit hasn't been feeling well lately.
Is he okay?

393
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:10,040
He said...

394
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,640
it's from the surgery.

395
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,903
But at his last check-up,
the doctor said he's getting better.

396
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,743
Just take care of him, okay?

397
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,870
I don't know where to care for him either.

398
00:47:29,653 --> 00:47:31,680
Why?

399
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,480
He rarely comes home.

400
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,320
And when he does,

401
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,120
it's really late.

402
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,156
And he rushes out early in the morning.

403
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,920
Okay. I'll talk to him.

404
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,720

Sorry, did I wake you up?

No worries. I dozed off.

410
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,009
I was going to ask you back at the hospital.

411
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,240
What is it?

What about you?

Where did you find it?

00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,223
In the drawer, under your desk.

417
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,920
Thank you.

418
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,563

the symptom-suppressing medicine?

You're the one...

Why? You're not happy I saved your life?

01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,916
I've seen your progress,

01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,623
from the first body...

01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,570

So you kept me alive...

482
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,120
instead of letting me die.

483
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,203
I couldn't let you die.

484
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,720
You're my masterpiece.

485
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,840
So you see me and Dr. Kan as nothing...

487
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,196
You and Kan...

488
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,440
are my favorite toys.

Now it's just you.

491
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,310
How could you do this to us?

492
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,985
This is me being generous.

493
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,885
I don't like to bully those
who are about to die--

494
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,560
Who do you think you are?

495
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,836
God or what!

496
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,896
Go on, shoot me.

497
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,440
Then everything I've planned...

498
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,560
will be finished.

499
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,325
What do you mean?

500
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,560
Hey, get inside!

501
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,040
Hey, watch out.

502
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,840
Stop.

503
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,520
Don't shoot him.

504
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,975
He's going to die anyway.

505
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,360
I'm curious to see

506
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,320
how this dying mouse will struggle

507
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,300
in its last gasp.

508
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,675
Get him out.

509
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,920
Go. Get him out.

510
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,240
Let's go.

511
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,083
- Clear all the security out.
- Yes, ma'am.

512
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,280
What the hell is going on?

513
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,640
Yes, Captain.

515
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,176
Picha's at the station now. Come pick her up.

516
01:04:04,786 --> 01:04:06,586
Captain,

517
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,429
can you

518
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
take Picha home for me?

519
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,153
Didn't I tell you to get some rest?

520
01:04:15,153 --> 01:04:18,206
Wit.

521
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,600
You should go back to her.

522
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,520
Take care of the one you love
while you still can.

523
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,310
If you were me,

524
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,850
would you dare go back to the one you love?

525
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,600
They'd come after me for sure.

526
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,860
So what now?

527
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,180
I need to finish this.

528
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,803
At least I want to expose them all
before I die.

529
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,276
But our evidence isn't enough to implicate her.

530
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,383
Next week, the House will vote
on the bill's third reading.

531
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,520
If it passes, it will move to the Senate.

532
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,800
Since the Constitutional Court
has already approved it,

533
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,920
we don't expect any major issues.

534
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,085
And what's the Senate's stance?

535
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,400
The Senate is starting to shift.

536
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,726
Seven out of ten senators
seem positive about the bill.

537
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:07,166
I think it will likely pass there, too.

538
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:09,680
What about the human rights groups?

539
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,019
Will they protest
and cause trouble like last time?

540
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:15,073
I don't think it's much of a concern.

541
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:18,600
Right now, people are terrified of psychopaths.

542
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,800
The Prime Minister's son's death

543
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,800
has made this law seem more justified.

544
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,080
So they're afraid to take any action.

545
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,880
Good.

546
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,183
I'll report to the Prime Minister myself.

547
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,960
If there's anything causing problems

548
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,880
or holding up the bill,

549
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,326
make sure it's taken care of.

550
01:06:46,326 --> 01:06:48,126
Understood.

551
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,650
Thank you.

552
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,760
Warden.

553
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,616
Hey! Get up!

554
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,560
Hands.

555
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,200
Take him out.

556
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,840
- Get up!
- Go.

557
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,329
- Come on!
- Go.

558
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,880
Get out!

559
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,496
Hey, take it easy. Save some for me, too.

560
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,440
I think the bill will easily pass
the third reading.

561
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,740
I'll prepare everything to show that

562
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:37,320
the Psychopathic Abortion Bill
is the best solution for this city.

563
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,560
Then...

564
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,240
I'll leave this to you.

565
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,376
Carry out everything you've planned

566
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,480
and make sure it succeeds.

567
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,700
Yes, sir.

568
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,500
Excuse me, ma'am.

569
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,123
- Who is it?
- It's 6060, ma'am.

570
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,040
Bussarin speaking.

571
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,430
Why are you doing this to me?

572
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,520
Over 20 years...

573
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,000
you survived execution.

574
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:20,596
I kept you alive
because I thought you were useful.

575
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,120
But in the end,

576
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,295
you failed,

577
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,025
not as skilled as you boasted.

578
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,200
Those who are no longer useful
shouldn't get special treatment.

579
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,239
That's enough.

580
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,070
Time's up. Get back to work. Go!

581
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,080
Thank you.

582
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,920
Wit, wait.

583
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,955
Is that you in the photo?

584
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,116
She was only my mom for a day,

585
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,416
but I still clearly remember how I felt then.

586
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:55,166
Where's your mom?

587
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,480
She couldn't come.

588
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,856
Then today, I'll be your mom.

589
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,475
Okay?

590
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,323
I'm about to have a kid, too.

591
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,956
I'm really scared he might grow up like me,

592
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,240
doing bad things.

593
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,876
You weren't born bad,

594
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,976
you were made this way by others.

595
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,143
Do you remember the sound?

596
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,769
Our child's heartbeat.

597
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,350
Can you treat me?

598
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,960
I don't know what happened to you.

599
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,760
I don't care.

600
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,600
If I'm gone,

601
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,480
please look after Picha and my kid.

602
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,320
What the hell is wrong with you?

603
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,080
I've survived this long...

604
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,680
because I stole other people's lives.

605
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,423
He wants to kill everyone who knows,
including Wit.
