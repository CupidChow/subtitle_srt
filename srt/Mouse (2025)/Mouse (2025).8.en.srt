Please help my dad.

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:14,900
Out of 100 people with the psychopathy gene,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,800
maybe only one doesn't become a serial killer.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,401
But that one might turn into a genius.

6
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:26,282
A society without crime exists only in theory.

7
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,881
Still, wouldn't it be great
if we could make it real?

8

He died too easily.

It was you? What do you want?

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,121
I'll kill you.

19
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:05,361
I'm suspicious about the medal
in the victim's mouth

20
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,042
and the slashes on their forehead.

21
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,342
What do you think the killer is trying to say?

22
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:16,882
Someone like you could never kill anyone.

23
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,802
If I had just killed you
like I did your parents,

24
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,522
you wouldn't be suffering now.

25
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:25,081
You couldn't hurt anyone. You're a cop.

26
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,762
I became a cop so I could kill him.

27
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,762
What's your problem?

28
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,181
Do you want Grandma to get in trouble?

29
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,602
The killer's a psychopath.

30

Psychopath...

31
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,561
He's not going to stop at just two victims.

32
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,442
So you're the one
who was talking about psychopaths.

33
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,682
Now everyone's in a panic.

34
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,561
I got rid of him.

35
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,281
Did you kill my son?

What are you doing here?

37
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,921
Grandma told me to check on you.

00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,861
The people are the water.

185
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,181
The water helps us float,

186
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:56,061
but it can also sink us.

187
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Yes.

188
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:07,660

Chief!

192
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,061
What?

193
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,221
Is your dad here?

194
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:21,981
Yes.
What?

195
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:23,701
My dad's here.

196
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:33,101
He's here? Clean this place up!

197
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,221
Clean it up. Come on, clean it up.

198
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,461
Hurry, clean it all up.

199
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,061
- Move it.
- It really is filthy in here.

200
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,620
Wipe it down.

201
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,380
Why didn't you tell me your dad was coming?!

202
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,941
Mr. Prime Minister, you didn't give us
any notice. We weren't prepared.

203
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,821
He wanted it to be a surprise.

204
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,221
To avoid formalities.

205
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:01,295
What brings the Prime Minister here?

206
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:02,895
You may not believe this,

207
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:05,176
but we nearly lost one of our finest officers.

208
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:06,335
That's true.

209
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,815
But thanks to his courage and determination,

210
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,055
he pulled through and came back to us.

211
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,496
He is the pride of our police force.

212
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,176
From now on, Lieutenant Patcharawit

213
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:24,200
will be a role model for the entire
Maga One police department.

214
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:50,936
Are you okay?

215
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:55,815
Just a bit of a headache, sir.

216
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,575
Alright, then let's wrap it up here.

217

Thank you, sir.

Yes, sir.

I'm counting on you.

220
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:08,615
You're counting on me?

221
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,216
To be my son's partner.

222
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,125
Uh...

223
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,895
Yes, of course, sir.

224
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:22,295
Alright, members of the press,
please come this way.

225
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:28,776
Oh, I forgot to introduce him. This is my son.

226
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,776
He's handsome, sir.

227
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,656
Just like you, sir.

228
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:34,055
May we take a photo?

229
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:35,895
Sure, go ahead.

230
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,335
Give us a smile, please.

231
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,056
He's handsome, just like his father.

232
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:41,855
Alright, that's enough for now.

233
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:42,855
This way, please.

234
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,055
Right this way, sir.

235
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,788
This way. Hurry up.

236
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,186
Is he really fully recovered?

237
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,335
According to the medical report,
he's back to normal.

238
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:19,216
That's good to hear.

239
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:20,696
Yes.

240
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,781
You know, at first I thought you'd died on us.

241
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,775
Congratulations, Lieutenant Wit.

242
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,615
Thank you, sir.

Congratulations.

00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,615
Thank you.

245
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:48,525
You still don't remember Picha, do you?

246
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,095
What about me?

247
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,035
Do you remember me?

248
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:03,256
I saw you looking at me during the ceremony.

249
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,936
I thought you recognized me.

250
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,736
Your face looks familiar.

251
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,416
You've got to be kidding me.

252
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:18,976
We worked cases together.

253
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:20,855
We did?

You asked to join my investigation team.

255

When I was practically dead at home,

256
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,086
you were the one who brought me food and water.

257

You're the one...

258
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:37,001
who found my brother's locket.

00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:54,736
Yeah, that's me.

262
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,375
I didn't see you at the station this morning.

263
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,176
Were you out on a case?

264
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:06,898
No.

265
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:09,755
What was his crime?

266
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,656
The suspect was a drug addict.

267
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:16,855
He was addicted to meth
and sexually assaulted women.

268
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,575
Then why did you use your firearm?

269
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:22,736
When you're chasing a suspect in the city,
you never know what might happen.

270
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:23,996
I had to be prepared.

271
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:27,436
Why did he fall from the building?

272
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:30,335
He jumped.

Right after we played a little question game.

Do you believe what you did was wrong?

275
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:41,676
Of course it was.

276
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:57,176
Just talk to him nicely.

277
00:22:57,936 --> 00:22:59,616
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

278
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:20,936
The disciplinary committee has reviewed
the case of Police Captain Ramil Nonthachai,

279
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:25,696
who discharged his firearm on duty,
leading to a suspect's death.

280
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:30,853
Based on the evidence, the committee finds
the action was performed in the line of duty.

281
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:34,692
Therefore, Police Captain Ramil Nonthachai

282
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:38,216
was acting within his responsibilities.

283
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,741
There was no personal motive or vendetta.

284
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:43,736
Therefore, no penalty will
be issued for this incident.

285
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:46,736
However, other disciplinary violations
were found,

286
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:50,064
such as the misuse of a service weapon

287
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:53,615
to intimidate civilians,

288
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,761
as well as other conduct violations

289
00:23:56,761 --> 00:24:00,776

overall image of the police force.

The committee hereby orders
Police Captain Ramil Nonthachai

be reassigned to the evidence archives unit,

292

00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,135
You remember Shinohm, right?

299

of the Amnesty Bill,

many groups, including the opposition party
and the public, voiced their disapproval.

307
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:22,187
The issue has split the nation.

between opposing factions.

Her wallet, valuables, and phone are all here.

367
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:45,696
Everything is untouched.

368
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:48,375
No signs of a struggle.

369
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,856
The door was locked from the inside.

370
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:56,855
Given the circumstances,
it was most likely a suicide.

371
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,775
What are you holding that for?

372
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:02,776
To catch the bad guys.

373
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:05,696
Are you okay?

374
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:07,376
You won't be needing that yet.

375
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:09,135
Give it here.

376
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:16,736
Oh, come on!

377
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,296
Go!

378
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:21,975
Hey.

379
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,225
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,325
Hey! Ugh.

381
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,150
Hey!

382
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:56,776
Picha.

383
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:03,026
First day back and you're already in trouble.

384
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,136
What did the doctor say?

385
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,515
He said he fainted.

386
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,315
They're keeping him for observation.

387
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,015
Did you catch the suspect?

388
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,415
No, sir,

389
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,376
but we found a body instead.

390
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,455
Captain, are you sure he's okay?

391
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,388
He seems a lot weaker this time around.

392
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,269
You said the same thing last time.

393
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:40,756
Keep an eye on him for me, Picha.

394
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:43,535
Okay.

395
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:49,428
Look after him.

396
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:07,696
[Maga One City Police Station]

397
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:13,855
[Special Investigation Unit]

398
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:14,855
Yes, sir.

399
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,136
- Are you going?
- Yeah.

400
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:27,656
Look what I brought.

401
00:36:31,696 --> 00:36:35,096
I knew the victim, Kaneungha. She was a nurse.

402
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:39,015
Any personal issues? Debt? Problems at work?

403
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:41,576
She seemed to enjoy her work.

404
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:45,895
As for debt, just her car loan,
and she was almost done paying it off.

405
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,816
She's the nurse who looked after Wit
during his recovery.

406
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:52,216
From what I could tell, she was a good person.

407
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,496
What about problems at work?

408
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:57,535
I wouldn't know about other departments.

409
00:36:57,535 --> 00:37:00,696
But here in the physical therapy department,
we were all close.

410
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:04,116
A kind soul. Doesn't seem like the type
to commit suicide.

411
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,375
No way.

412
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:08,415
She wasn't the type
to do something rash like that.

413
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:12,696
It might have been a murder.

414
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:17,455
She did once mention a man she was seeing.

415
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,755
Do you know who it was?

416
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,009
What are you doing here?

417
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:29,421
I was hoping to be reassigned here.

418
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:33,703
You've caused hundreds of problems already.

419
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:37,262
Give me one good reason
why I should let you back.

420
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,522
For personal reasons?

421
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:42,415
I've been stuck in the archives for two years.
It's incredibly boring.

422
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,903
But for professional reasons...

423
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,321
First,

424
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:51,302
no matter what, I believe
Wit still needs a mentor.

425
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,103
Second,

426
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:56,603
I have a feeling the serial killer
is going to strike again.

427
00:37:57,063 --> 00:38:00,063
And third, you know better than anyone

428
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:02,822
that no one is more suited for this case
than me.

429
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,262
So confident.

430
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:08,900
And what if I say no?

431
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,250
Come on.

432
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,422
You basically raised me.

433
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:14,102
You wouldn't be that heartless.

434
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:16,223
Me?

435
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:17,462
I didn't raise you.

436
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:20,422
Tak was the one who asked me to.

437
00:38:20,422 --> 00:38:24,143
Either way, my answer is no.

438
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:27,543
- The Prime Minister's son.
- Yes.

439
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,262
Get your dad on the phone.
I'll talk to him myself.

440
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:30,262
Okay.

441
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:31,503
Now.

442
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:32,743
One second.

443
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,543
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

444
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:37,982
- Put it away.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:47,583
You're going to give me a migraine
or high blood pressure.

446
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:52,154
If I'd known, I would've told Tak
to strangle you when you were a kid.

447
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,499
Then I wouldn't have to deal with this.

448
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,183
Awesome.

449
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:21,028
- Wit.
- Yes.

450
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,578
Go on up and visit Grandma.
I'll be up in a minute.

451
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,862
Your grandma?

452
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:31,863
You're the one who saved her.

453
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,462
Fourth floor, room 475. Go on.

454
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,399
Did I...

455
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,543
really save her?

456
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,623
If you hadn't blocked the killer,

457
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,643
my grandma would be dead.

458
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,788
You almost didn't make it yourself.

459
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:30,043
I'd like to ask about the relationship

460
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:34,462
between Kaneungha and you, Director.

461
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,782
Can you promise me
my family won't find out about this?

462
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:48,902
This may be related to the case.

463
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:52,723
I can't promise you that.

464
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:57,262
But I can advise you to tell me the truth.

465
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:01,623
Everyone knew I was married.

466
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:03,743
She knew it too.

467
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:07,242
We were seeing each other casually
for two or three years.

468
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,043
Based on what we've heard from others,

469
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:25,382
Kaneungha had no reason to kill herself.

470
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:29,401
Which means it's possible this was a murder.

471
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:30,755
What?

472
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:32,103
A murder?

473
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,342
Thank you for your time, Director.

474
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:46,223
But if I find any new leads
connecting you and Ms. Kaneungha,

475
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:49,462
I'll have to come back
and speak with you again.

476
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:51,503
Understood.

477
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:05,462
Then why was my grandma attacked?

478
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,451
She found evidence of the murders.

479
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:12,703
That's why he tried to kill her.

480
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:33,503
Police.

481
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:39,023
I'd like to see the work logs for all staff
between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.

482
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,703
on the night Kaneungha died.

483
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:42,223
One moment, please.

484
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,023
Here you go.

485
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:56,942
What does this crossed-out name mean?

486
00:42:57,262 --> 00:42:59,703
The director covered Dr. Anutin's
surgery shift.

487
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,342
And before he went into the surgery,

488
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:04,623
do you know what he was doing?

489
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,862
I wouldn't know.

490
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,822
I'm sorry, Grandma.

491
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:13,812
I should have been able to protect you.

492
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,223
Grandma!

493
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,782
Grandma!

494
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:24,942
Nurse, help!

495
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:31,862
Her blood pressure is dropping. Ploy!

496
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:38,232
Go get her attending physician.

497
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:42,743
Grandma!

498
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:49,622
Her condition is stable now.

499
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,223
What happened?

500
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:07,583
Wit. Hey, what's wrong with you?

501
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:09,743
Wit!

502
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,982
Wit.

503
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:18,422
Wit!

504
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:21,302
What's wrong?

505
00:44:21,822 --> 00:44:22,822
What happened?

506
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:30,223
Wit!

507
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,103
I'm fine.

508
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:36,628
I'm fine.

509
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:37,961
You sure?

510
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:46,063
So what exactly is wrong with me?

511
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:51,503
It's a form of neurogenic shock.

512
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:54,623
Let me explain.

513
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:58,342
With a very delicate procedure,
like brain surgery,

514
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,342
there can be certain side effects.

515
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:05,462
Right now, your brain is re-organizing
its memories.

516
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,902
The images you're seeing in your mind
are causing you anxiety.

517
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:14,743
When you get anxious,
your heart rate speeds up.

518
00:45:15,623 --> 00:45:19,103
Then, oxygen can't get to your brain
fast enough,

519
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,693
which causes you to lose consciousness.

520
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:26,953
Is it serious?

521
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:33,273
From what I can tell now,
it's nothing too concerning.

522
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:38,473
But we can't let our guard down either.

523
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:40,634
If these symptoms appear again,

524
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:43,353
please come see me immediately.

525
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:45,674
I will.

526
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,554
Thank you very much, Doctor.

527
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:50,714
You're welcome.

528
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,594
I won't take up any more of your time then.

529
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:53,594
Alright.

530
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:56,114
Goodbye.

531
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:22,074
Sir,

532
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:28,234
Wit just came to see me
about his neurological symptoms.

533
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:30,393
Yes.

534
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:34,154
There you are.

535
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:38,074
How did it go?

536
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:43,554
The doctor said my brain is just
reorganizing memories.

537
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:47,953
It doesn't seem like anything serious.

538
00:46:47,953 --> 00:46:48,953
That's good.

539
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:51,634
It's great that it's nothing serious.
You'll recover in no time.

540
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:54,114
Do you remember us?

541
00:46:55,634 --> 00:46:56,634
Do you?

542
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:00,473
Name?

543
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:03,514
You're Shinohm.

544
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:05,793
And me?

545
00:47:12,674 --> 00:47:13,674
Captain Angkan.

546
00:47:13,674 --> 00:47:15,473
Hey, you remember!

547
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:17,833
What about over there?

548
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:21,970
Well, she...

549
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,852
Picha told me her name the first time we met.

550
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:32,074
Last time you said you didn't remember her.

551
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:33,694
Now you remember perfectly.

552
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:36,993
Wit.

553
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:37,913
Yes.

554
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:40,634
I'm sure you'll be completely
back to your old self soon.

555
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:42,473
This calls for a celebration!

556
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:43,514
- You're in?
- Barbecue!

557
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:44,554
No way.

558
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,393
He's not fully recovered yet.

559
00:47:48,873 --> 00:47:50,194
I know, I know.

560
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:52,434
Come on, I'll take you home.

561
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:55,694
Had enough fun yet?

562
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:57,234
Time to go.

563
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:58,234
Celebrating?

564
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,202
So no barbecue.

565
00:48:01,202 --> 00:48:03,674
It's fine. The two of us can go celebrate.

566
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:04,674
Get home safe.

567
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:15,833
Wit.

568
00:48:16,114 --> 00:48:17,313
Yes?

569
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:19,563
The body you found in the abandoned building,

570
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:22,934
and Kaneungha's body...

571
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:27,194
do you think they're connected?

572
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,083
The condition of the bodies was very similar.

573
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:34,433
Right.

574
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:37,194
And the knots they used...

575
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:42,433
What about them?

576
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,954
I feel like I've seen them somewhere before.

577
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:55,953
Is another psychopathic killer on the loose?

578
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:54,603
You...

579
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:56,993
How are you feeling?

580
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,313
Is your headache gone?

581
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:01,754
It's better now.

582
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:05,353
Then why did you faint earlier?

583
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:12,444
I'm not sure.

584
00:50:13,265 --> 00:50:14,393
I just blacked out.

585
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:19,153
You should go see a doctor
for a more detailed check-up.

586
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,913
I already did.

587
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:29,154
The doctor said I might have fainted
partly because I was on an empty stomach.

588
00:50:30,514 --> 00:50:31,634
You haven't eaten?

589
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,194
No.

590
00:50:33,194 --> 00:50:34,194
Here.

591
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:38,754
Thank you.

592
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,674
I'll handle it for you.

593
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:10,273
Let's eat some noodles. This place is amazing.

594
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,446
You first.

595
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,833
Smells great.

596
00:52:07,993 --> 00:52:10,594
Wit, are you okay?

597
00:52:12,473 --> 00:52:13,953
I'm sorry.

598
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,463
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

599
00:52:16,463 --> 00:52:18,234
I'll get a cloth and clean it up.

600
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,050
Feeling good, huh?

601
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,194
Wit.

602
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:37,433
Wit. Wit.
Wit.

603
00:53:14,353 --> 00:53:15,433
Let me wipe you down.

604
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,913
I'm sorry.

605
00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:20,993
This happened again.

606
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,114
It's okay.

607
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:25,629
But maybe...

608
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:27,234
you should see a doctor?

609
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:29,793
You don't seem well.

610
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:49,554
What's wrong?

611
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:53,754
Just give me five minutes.

612
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,314
Let's pick a name for our baby.

613
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:56,074
It's okay now.

614
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:00,473
You're okay now.

615
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:17,993
Are you okay?

616
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:24,703
I...

617
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:28,242
I'm okay.

618
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:31,819
You should go home, Picha.

619
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:38,234
Are you sure?

620
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:40,393
Yeah.

621
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:48,554
Then I'll head home.

622
00:57:19,754 --> 00:57:22,313
So much to sort through.

623
00:57:24,806 --> 00:57:26,687
There's so much info, Wit.

624
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:31,087
I have no idea
what the captain wants with all this.

625
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:35,527
Feeling any better, Wit?

626
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:43,167
Forensics is sending over the autopsy reports
for the bodies you two found.

627
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,727
Compare them to nurse Kaneungha's case.

628
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,806
Will do.

629
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:48,966
Wit, can you help me look them up?

630
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,567
Just pull the files on deaths by hanging.

631
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:54,127
Sure.

632
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:57,926
What?

633
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:16,846
What is it?

634
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:27,567
Who is she?

635
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,067
She's a reporter.

636
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:32,867
Her name is Chanya.

637
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:34,687
Chanya.

638
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:36,626
Do you recognize her?

639
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:41,406
Her face just flashed in my mind.

640
00:58:47,406 --> 00:58:49,086
It just popped into my head.

641
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:53,120
Chanya...

642
00:58:54,412 --> 00:58:55,779
used to work with us.

643
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:09,167
Was she your girlfriend?

644
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:11,527
No, not at all.

645
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:16,926
Then who was her boyfriend?

646
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:25,900
If I wanted to find her,

647
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,406
where would she be?

648
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:34,806
I don't know.

649
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:52,647
Chanya.

650
00:59:54,766 --> 00:59:55,806
Chanya.

651
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:11,887
When did you get in?

652
01:00:13,246 --> 01:00:14,246
This morning.

653
01:00:23,647 --> 01:00:27,647
You must be here for a reason.

654
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:34,607
There's a lot I want to talk to you about.

655
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:42,607
My wife is the same as she's always been.

656
01:00:43,861 --> 01:00:44,948
So,

657
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:48,519
are you just visiting,
or are you back for good?

658
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,727
I'm back for good.

659
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:53,966
Good.

660
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,966
And don't worry about a place to stay.

661
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,217
I've had a housekeeper
clean your place every week.

662
01:01:01,846 --> 01:01:03,167
Thank you so much.

663
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:09,487
You're back because of the amnesty bill,
aren't you?

664
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,087
On the surface, it doesn't look like much.

665
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:18,296
But I think there's something
going on behind the scenes.

666
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:21,087
Why are you so focused on this?

667
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:24,766
It's just another piece of legislation.

668
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,067
Excuse me for a moment.

669
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:45,007
I knew you'd be here.

670
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:46,727
Hello, Inspector.

671
01:01:46,727 --> 01:01:48,286
How'd you know I was here?

672
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:50,246
I stopped by the station and you weren't there,

673
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:52,296
so I figured you'd be at your usual spot.

674
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,227
Wait just a moment, what's going on here?

675
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:58,866
Having a secret date?

676
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:00,907
Where is she?

677
01:02:00,907 --> 01:02:05,246
Hey, knock it off. Don't even think about that.

678
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:06,866
She stepped out for a call.

679
01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:08,746
You know her, actually.

680
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,687
Hello?

681
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:14,406
Are you there yet?

682
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,647
Why? Is something urgent?

683
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:18,966
Yeah.

684
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:21,687
Come to the studio today.

685
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:23,047
Alright, okay.

686
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:25,727
Ever since you started working with me,

687
01:02:26,766 --> 01:02:28,821
you've looked like a sad puppy.

688
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:31,647
You tell me. The work at the archives
is deadly dull.

689
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:34,487
I don't know how you put up with it.

690
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:41,007
When you've lost everyone important to you,

691
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:43,807
no job seems important anymore.

692
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:46,926
Excuse me.

693
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:49,007
Yes?

694
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,527
Is the item I asked for ready?

695
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:52,207
Yes, it's ready. One moment.

696
01:02:57,926 --> 01:02:59,426
So what brought you here?

697
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,870
Well...

698
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,477
I...

699
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,959
I came to thank you.

700
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:12,001
Working with you these past two years

701
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:13,366
has given me a lot to think about.

702
01:03:13,846 --> 01:03:15,846
Oh, really?

703
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:20,207
As far as I can see, you haven't changed a bit.

704
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:23,681
Let's just say...

705
01:03:23,681 --> 01:03:27,127
that who I am today is
thanks to you and the chief.

706
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:33,687
Now, let me do what I came here for,
a little more formally.

707
01:03:34,446 --> 01:03:35,446
Thank you.

708
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:43,406
Well, I won't disturb you any longer.

709
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:45,366
Enjoy your meal.

710
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:09,527
Happy birthday.

711
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:14,367
How did you know it was my birthday?

712
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:18,806
We're friends on Facebook.

713
01:04:18,806 --> 01:04:20,246
Oh. Thank you.

714
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,846
Orange cake. Your favorite.

715
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:26,007
Let's eat.

716
01:04:38,054 --> 01:04:39,766
Thanks so much.

717
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:48,766
Wait. Wait. Wait.

718
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:54,806
I'm so happy to be working with everyone again.

719
01:04:56,286 --> 01:05:00,366
Thank you for not giving up
on our mission to find the truth for society.

720
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:06,687
Hey!

721
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:09,406
What's all this?

722
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:15,607
How many times have I told you?
No food in the meeting room.

723
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:16,846
What is this?

724
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,406
Are you using your hands?

725
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:20,207
What?

726
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,446
That's disgusting.

727
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,322
Wipe it.

728
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:25,727
Ew.

729
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:27,827
How are you going to be a real journalist?

730
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:29,692
You have to be on the field.

731
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:33,252
And listen. When you come back this time,

732
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:36,999
no melodramatics
like that livestream last time.

733
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:40,292
