on TV are huge!

to clarify matters to the public.

- I'll be right back.

- Where are you going? What the hell?
- is the amnesty issue.

96
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,230
- Get everyone in here. We're on standby.
- Amnesty gives offenders a second chance...

97
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,040
- Understand? Don't go anywhere.
- and they have already shown remorse...

98
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,076
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:49,120
They deserve a chance to reenter society.

100
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,876
- The amnesty law gives criminals a chance...
- No way.

101
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:51,960
- How could she say that?
- to wipe their slate clean...

102
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
Right, so this means

103
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,160
- letting these prisoners return to society.
- but children born with psychopathic genes...

104
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
- What? How can they do that?
- committed the crimes and were released.

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,440
- Ms. Bussarin, how would you explain this issue?
- That way, society is full of convicts.

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,360
No matter what happens,

108
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I will never, ever kill my own child.

No matter what, huh?

110
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,096
Even though our kid was born,

111
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,950
- and everyone knows they're a killer's child?
- I don't care.

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,240
How did they let them out?

113
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
It took them forever to catch him.

114
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,720
We were all wondering
when they'd finally catch him.

115
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
- How much is it, Aunty?
- 10 Baht, honey.

116
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
These prisoners, they've been punished,

117
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,200
but that doesn't mean
they've learned their lesson.

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,243
Yes, that's true.

119
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,840
Hey, they've been released.

120
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,600
They should get a chance
to turn over a new leaf.

121
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,240
How can you be sure? Even if they're given
a chance, they'll only do good?

122
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,680
They've done bad before, they'll do it again.

123
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,360
We still have to give them a chance.

124
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,403
You're a good person.

125
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
Our kid will definitely be good, too.

126
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,480
How do you know, Picha?
How can you be sure I'm a good person?

127
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm not even sure myself if I'm good or bad.

128
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
- Hey.
- Go, get out.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
Just get out already.
Don't ever show up here again.

130
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
You're old and out of touch.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
So you just kick people out like that?

132
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Hey, folks, come deal with this!

133
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,260
Hey, hey, hey!

134
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,520
What the hell are you guys doing here?

135
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,400
Do they have to be your family to get a chance?

136
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,560
It's quite strange.

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,960
Not long after the amnesty,

138
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,010
there were reports that
the released prisoners had died.

139
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,080
We're currently investigating the cause.

140
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,800
This won't just be quietly forgotten, right?

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,360
Absolutely not.

142
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,970
Once we get any leads,
we'll report back immediately.

143
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,760
Thank you.

144
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,120
They've already been punished.

145
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,040
Now that they're out,
shouldn't we give them a chance?

146
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
You're too narrow-minded.

147
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Yeah, you only see one side of things.

148
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,869
How would you know they'd do it again
if you don't give them a chance?

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,043
And on this matter,
what's the Prime Minister's opinion?

150
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,120
I can't answer for the Prime Minister.

151
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,510
I can only speak within my responsibilities.

152
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,640
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,200
Suchart,

154
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,600
how did Ms. Bussarin
get to appear on the live show?

155
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
Don't worry, sir.

156
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,810
Our secretary is well prepared.

157
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,800
For prisoners who are still alive,
if they go and commit crimes again,

158
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,756
how does the government
prevent them from reoffending?

159
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,080
From what we've seen,

160
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,960
only a few commit crimes again.

161
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Because they're not psychopaths

162
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
or serial killers.

163
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,440
Doesn't it seem a bit contradictory?

164
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,160
The law gives killers a second chance,

165
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,120
but kids born with psychopathic genes
lose their chance at life...

166
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,520
You see?

167
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
even though they haven't done anything wrong.

168
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,840
If this experiment succeeds,
society will definitely benefit.

169
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,120
- Absolutely!
- That's right!

170
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Who would do that anyway?

171
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,880
Those reporters just make up fake evidence.

172
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,200
- Yes, that's right!
- Yeah, exactly!

173
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
If you don't know what you're talking about,
you should just shut up.

174
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,240
- Yes, just shut up!
- Yeah, absolutely!

175
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,036
Is this prisoner release
some kind of experiment?

176
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,679
No, definitely not.

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,400
- Do you know the Peaceful Society Association?
- Yes, I do.

178
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,480
I donate scholarships
to top students there every year,

179
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,956
[Spin News - Scholarship Award Ceremony]
as you can see here.

180
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Have you ever heard of
an organization called OZ?

181
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,125
Never.

182
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,170
But I have information that links you
to this organization.

183
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Excuse me.

184
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,176
Hey, check this SD card for me.

185
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,250
Sure, just a sec.

186
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,400
Send it to the same email as before.
Send this clip, this clip, this clip.

187
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,463
- But don't send this one.
- Okay.

188
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,770
What the hell are you doing?
I said don't send that clip!

189
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,680
Hey, I didn't hear you!

190
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,240
Can you get it back?

191
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Wait, let me check.

192
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,383
Too late, someone received it.

193
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,960
If you don't answer,

194
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,336
may I explain myself?

195
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,080
These kids in the photo...

196
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,520
are the ones who were found
to have the psychopath gene.

197
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,440
They were brought here for research.

198
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,003
At that time, the Psychopathic Abortion Bill
didn't pass in Parliament,

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,560
but OZ ran secret research,

200
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,360
using the Peaceful Society Association
as a cover,

201
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,080
under your supervision, right, Ms. Bussarin?

202
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,480
The Psychopathic Abortion Bill
from 25 years ago...

203
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,560
never passed, even before I took office.

204
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,960
All those projects were stopped.

205
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,840
So if you're asking if I was involved,

206
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,360
the answer is no.

207
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,760
Then why bring the Psychopathic Abortion Bill

208
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,480
back to Parliament?

209
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,200
That's right.

210
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,560
We want Maga One City to be crime-free.

211
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,880
This law seems like the best solution.

212
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,450
But it's not enforced yet,
so you can't accuse me of anything.

213
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,840
What about this then?

214
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,440
As I've said,

215
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,960
I provide scholarships to gifted students
at this foundation every year.

216
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,840
This photo is just a keepsake.

217
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,023
So you deny being behind OZ?

218
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
Hey, should we show this photo side by side?

219
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,796
- Side by side on Chanya's show?
- Yeah.

220
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
- Take it to her.
- Sure.

221
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,080
I was just attending a lecture.

222
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,880
Chanya, here.

223
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,796
Everyone, move out and stop the protest. Hurry!

224
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,720
Get out! Get out! Get out!

225
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,800
For the events happening at various locations,

226
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,000
our station is broadcasting live.

227
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,963
You can follow along
from the corner of your screen.

228
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,969
After the abortion bill failed in Parliament,

229
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,316
but secret research projects continued.

230
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,680
Many children were taken for experiments...

231
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,520
to see if those with psychopathic genes

232
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
would exhibit violent behavior as theorized,

233
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,520
or to see what factors might trigger
their aggression.

234
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,080
I've never heard of this.
I never received any reports.

235
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
Where did you get this information?

236
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,233
The children found with psychopathic genes
were contacted to join the program,

237
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,640
with full scholarships as bait.

238
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,520
Their parents agreed,
so the children participated.

239
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,556
What exactly are you talking about?

240
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
Behind this human experiment...

241
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,520
is the Peaceful Society Association
and the OZ organization,

242
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,160
which you've been funding
and supporting all along.

243
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,440
Ms. Chanya,

244
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I've said it many times,
I only provide scholarships.

245
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,976
I have nothing to do with these experiments.

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm just using a killer to kill other killers.

247
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,600
But our evidence isn't enough to implicate her.

248
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,880
I'm just using a killer to kill other killers.

249
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,840
So you kept me alive...

250
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,720
Is that enough for you?

251
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,616
- So you kept me alive...
- Yes.

252
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,243
I couldn't let you die.

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,850
You're my masterpiece.

254
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,510
So you see me and Dr. Kan as nothing...

255
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,603
but lab mice?

256
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,790
You and Kan...

257
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,160
are my favorite toys...

258
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Where are you going, Ms. Bussarin?
Come back and explain this!

259
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,520
Ms. Bussarin!

260
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,240
- Ms. Bussarin!
- Chanya.

261
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,330
- Ms. Bussarin!
- Chanya, easy.

262
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,960
How could you do this to us?

263
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,640
This is me being generous.

264
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,200
You're going off-script
from the questions we provided.

265
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,240
You're going to be sued,
all of you, including the station.

266
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,600
Sued for what?

267
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,680
For giving false information
about government agencies,

268
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,890
creating fake evidence and witnesses.

269
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,890
I think you've got it wrong.

270
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,320
We're just... doing our job as journalists,

271
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,683
presenting the facts to viewers.

272
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
And you call this good journalism?

273
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
Better get ready.

274
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,656
So you see me and Dr. Kan as nothing...

275
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,670
but lab mice?

276
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:16,752
Chanya.

277
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
Come here.

278
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,480
So, what's next?

279
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,400
Hey.

280
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,080
Listen to me,

281
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,296
keep exposing them until it's done,
then let the law handle it.

282
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,433
Go.

283
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:48,880
Wait, hold on.

284
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,720
Hey! Stop! Stop now!

285
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,960
What the hell is going on?

286
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,560
- They started it and caused chaos!
- Yeah! They started it.

287
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,200
Wait, move away. Get out first.

288
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
- Calm down.
- Get out.

289
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,436
You got something to say, say it to my face!

290
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,840
Let's calm down first, just a moment.

291
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,000
Stop! Stop, wait!

292
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
From the interview with Ms. Bussarin,
the Prime Minister's secretary, a moment ago,

293
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm sure everyone watching
is thinking the same.

294
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,120
If we let society create killers
to hunt down killers,

295
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,503
we need to ask ourselves:
Is this really the right thing to do?

296
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,463
Cut the feed from the M News Station.

297
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,183
What are we going to do now?

298
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,520
Hello.

299
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,160
The station has been cut off the air.

300
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,000
We're going live again,

301
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,170
online this time.

302
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,667
Can you have someone contact Dr. Orachun
for an interview?

303
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,120
No.

304
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Why not? This is our chance
to get the whole truth.

305
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,240
No.

306
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,440
Listen to me,

307
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,496
calm down, and get ready for the show.

308
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:20,739
Okay.

309
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,120
- You murderer! You killed them!
- How can you do that?

310
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
You're the Gold Leaf killer!

311
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,000
Everyone ready?

312
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,996
We're about to start the online segment.

313
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
Okay, everyone, ready to shoot.

314
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,616
Five, four, three, two, and action.

315
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,840
[Spin News]
Thank you all for following our show online.

316
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,960
Please don't forget to share our link.

317
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,840
All the information I've gathered is reliable.

318
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,000
Whether it's the Peaceful Society Association,

319
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
the OZ, psychopathic killers,
prisoner releases,

320
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,560
and recent murders,

321
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,960
everything is connected.

322
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,360
I've learned...

323
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,400
there's an attempt to bring
the Psychopathic Abortion Bill

324
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,640
back to Parliament.

325
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,440
This law was rejected 30 years ago,

326
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,520
so why is it being reconsidered now?

327
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,196
Who's behind this? Or who benefits from this?

328
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
Break down the door
and shut down the broadcast now.

329
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,440
The Prime Minister ordered the feed to be cut.

330
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
But they're still on the air.

331
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,880
We have a special guest today,
who will share some information with us.

332
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Please welcome...

333
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,300
Hello, I'm Jirawan,

334
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,636
ex-wife of Dr. Orachun, the Bounty Hunter.

335
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,200
With a strong and smart mother,

336
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,250
our child is bound to be clever.

337
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,000
27 years ago,

338
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,400
after Orchun was convicted,

339
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,960
I had to change my surname

340
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,396
so no one would know me or recognize me.

341
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,350
I was pregnant at the time.

342
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,320
It's not about whether
you could raise the child or not.

343
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,010
The child was born, but would be labeled
as the killer's offspring.

344
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,650
So I asked Dr. Danai to check
the psychopathic genes of the child in my womb.

345
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm going to terminate my pregnancy.

346
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,013
I'll forward your name to the medical team
that handles this procedure.

347
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:02,813
Okay.

348
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
Go get an abortion.

349
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,040
No matter what happens,

350
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,769
I will never, ever kill my own child.

351
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,483
The test results came in,
and he might be part of that one percent.

352
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,920
When Kan was a child, he never showed
any signs of violence.

353
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,880
Kan, what are you drawing?

354
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,000
Let me see.

355
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,750
I'm helping stitch a patient.
I want to save his life.

356
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,200
Good job, son.

357
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,316
But as he... hit adolescence,

358
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,950
he started having intense emotions.

359
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,330
He got irritated and angry easily,

360
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,240
and I could't help but wonder if it was
because of the psychopathic genes he carried.

[Emergency Room]

362
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,163
Hey. Don't think I won't report you
just because you have money.

363
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,225
How did you raise a kid to be a thug?

364
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,800
Enough,

365
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,640
what do you want?

366
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,536
What else do you want?

367
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,250
Look what he's done. See? Look at my face.

368
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,040
You want money?

369
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,560
- 20,000 Baht.
- No way,

370
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,000
my son didn't do anything wrong.

371
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,200
Why do I have to pay?

372
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,270
- You--
- Then who did it?

373
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,080
You can't talk about my kid like this.

374
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
If we can't settle it,
we'll talk to the police.

375

Don't threaten me.

376
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
I'm not threatening.

377

What's this?

378
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,523
What the hell are you messing
with my family for?

379
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,243
Let me ask your kid,
where did this wound come from?

380
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
Who did this?

381
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Who did this? Tell me.

382
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,163
Look at me, don't be scared.

383
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,280
What? A father hitting his kid,
nothing's wrong.

384
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,200
Because you're drunk!

385
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Every time you drink, you beat him.

386
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,240
You think it's normal?

387
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,920
And you're hurt because my son helped yours.

388
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,470
What else do you want? Can you stop?

389
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,880
Fine. But he apologizes to me first.

390
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
My son doesn't need to apologize.

391
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,920
He saved your kid.

392
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,680
You're the one who should apologize to him!

393
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,920
Kan.

394
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,446
I'm sorry.

395
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,400
Please.

396
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,136
- Guard the door. Don't let anyone in.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,110
He got through his teenage years

398
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,363
without anything too violent.

399
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,596
He managed his emotions
better than most kids his age.

400
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,929
What changed was that...

401
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,600
Kan grew colder,

402
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,880
unshaken by anything.

403
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,040
But that coldness wasn't a lack of feeling,

404
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,880
on the contrary,

405
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,040
it showed his concern for others.

406
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Because no matter what,

407
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,000
I know Kan has always felt
my love as his mother.

408
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,480
So when bad things happened to him,

409
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,209
he just let them pass.

410
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,800
That's all I got.

411
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,623
What proves Dr. Kan isn't a killer...

412
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,600
is the day he found out
he was going to be a father.

413
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,360
- Oh.
- See?

414
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,023
I saw you at the hospital...

415
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,869
so I secretly checked your records.

416
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,083
You cheater.

417
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,520
See?

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,300
Our baby.

419
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,626
Yes.

420
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,663
So is it a boy or a girl?

421
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
We can't confirm yet.

422
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,896
But boy or girl, I'll love them just the same.

423
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:48,560
How about you?

424
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,500
You want a boy or a girl?

425
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,699
A girl.

426
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,560
Why?

427
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,630
She'll be adorable like me.

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,090

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
Kawinchaya.

433
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,996
Dr. Kan found out I was pregnant.

434
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,720
That day,

435
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,990
we had many things to talk about.

436
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,496
Kan, what's wrong?

437
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,080
Are you hurt?

438
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,000
Kan.

439
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,080
Kan.

440
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm scared.

Don't worry,

442
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,060
I'll take good care of myself.

443
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,990
I'm afraid our kid will inherit
the psychopath gene from me.

444
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,680
Don't be afraid.

445
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,383

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,536
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

473
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,720
From what we've observed in Dr. Kan,

474
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,960
it's clear that...

475
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,720
he isn't a psychopath.

476
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,280
A true psychopath...

477
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,600
wouldn't show such gentle feelings.

478
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,200
Based on Dr. Danai's research,

479
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,600
upbringing plays a crucial role
in children's behavior.

480
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,840
Doctor, could you expand on that a bit?

481
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,440
A good family environment...

482
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,575
can reduce violent and aggressive tendencies.

483
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,760
Having the psychopathic gene doesn't mean
someone will automatically become a killer.

And here's confirmation from the expert:

491
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,080
Even if someone carries the psychopathic gene,

492
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,575
it doesn't mean they will become a killer.

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,160
Chanya is about to expose the OZ organization
that I told you about before.

Do you remember?

498
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,440

- So this organization--
- Wait.

501
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,225
Hold on, wait.

502
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,350
- We don't want it!
- We don't want it!

- Chief.
- What?

506
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,720
Should we call in backups?
I don't think we can handle them.

507
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Yeah, call them in.

508
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,440
Upbringing, love, care,

509
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,320
even the environment,

510
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,600
- these can all influence behavior, right?
- That's right.

511
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,200
But conversely,
someone without the psychopathic gene,

512
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,480
if they're raised poorly
or influenced by a bad environment,

513
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,300
they can still become a murderer in the future.

514

And here's confirmation from the expert:

515
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,636
Even if someone carries the psychopathic gene,
it doesn't mean they will become a killer.

516
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,880
It's the upbringing and environment
that can turn someone into a killer.

00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,200
Besides, we don't know
if what Dr. Danai said is true

530
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,000
or if he's just protecting his own interests.

531
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,175
But you don't have to take responsibility.
I'll handle it myself.

532
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,333
Yes, sir.

533
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,816
Take out every single witness!

534
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,760
Do it.

535
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,560
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,440
Take them out.

537
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,920
As the doctor said earlier,

538
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,526
upbringing and environment are key factors
in violent behavior.

539
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:34,000
That's right.

540
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
Based on the children
we've been observing in our study,

541
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,840
these children carry the psychopathy gene,

542
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,800
but they're raised in a proper environment.

543
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,225
Believe it or not, none of these children
has shown aggressive behavior.

544
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,200
With today's medical advances,

545
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,120
we can transplant parts
of Dr. Kan's brain to some psychopaths.

546
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,400
This can give the recipients
new personalities opposite to their own.

547
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,600
Traits like gentleness or compassion,

548
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,750
could be described
as a form of dual personality.

549
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,680
I've saved up some money.

550
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm thinking of finding a small plot of land...

551
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,025
for the three of us.

552
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,700
For you and our baby.

553
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,560
After Dr. Kan's death,

554
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,813
I tried to gather evidence to prove...

555
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,720
his innocence.

556
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,200
But he was framed as a murderer,

557
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,440
even though he never killed anyone.

558
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,950
Now that Dr. Kan is dead,

559
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,675
similar murder cases have emerged.

560
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,440
So the Gold Leaf Killer is still at large.

561
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,000
Up next, we'll meet someone
we thought was a victim...

562
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,320
or maybe he's the real killer.

563
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,750
We'll be back after the break.

564
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,480
- Hey! Open the door!
- Hey!

565
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,425
This is the police!
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,400
[Spin News]

567
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,696
Today, I've invited a key victim
of the OZ organization.

568
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,400
As mentioned earlier, this organization
experimented on children,

569
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,320
an unethical and immoral study.

570
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,760
But our team can't reach this guest
at the moment.

571
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,000
Have you arrived at his place?

572
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,160
Hey,

573
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,100
keep filming.
Roll tape, five, four, three, two.

574
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,600
Uh... sorry, everyone.
We've just reached this key victim.

575
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm now here with
Police Lieutenant Patcharawit Muksigprakarn.

576
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,250
The key victim
who will reveal the truth today. Hello.

577
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,880
Why can't you do it?

578
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,000
Why haven't you done it yet?

579
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,625
Hello.

580
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,120
The signal's clear, right?

581
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,150
It's clear. Can you hear me?

582
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,800
I'm not even sure myself if I'm good or bad.

583
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,480
- Go get an abortion.
- Wit.

584
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,056
Go get an abortion!

585
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,680
Wit.

586
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,920
It's okay, I can do it. Just underwear.

587
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,600
Just underwear? No, I'll do it myself.

588
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,160
It's okay. I've done a few.
Just underwear, see?

589
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,300
First of all...

590
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,875
I want to apologize to the victims' families...

591
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,300
who were murdered
in the Gold Leaf Killer cases.

592
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,725
I believe everyone...

593
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,700
still remembers the murder cases...

594
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,616
with gold leaf.

595
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,025
But why are you apologizing
to the victims' families?

596
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,175
Why do I have to do that?

597
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,450
It's because of what I'm about to tell--

598
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,760
Lieutenant?

599
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,016
As I said earlier,

600
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:17,150
the reason I apologize
is because of what I'm about to share...

601
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,325
Since I was young...

602
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,325
Will you ever do this again? Will you?

603
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,360
My family...

604
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,200
was murdered.

605
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,080
My mom,

606
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,625
my step-dad,

607
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,116
and our house was burned down.

608
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,475
Nothing was left.

609
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,950
When I became a cop,

610
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,156
I... tried to track down my family's killer.

611
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,040
I searched through
countless case files for years.

612
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,750
But no matter how hard I tried,

613
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,240
I found no leads.

614
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,200
Then one day,

615
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,600
I got a mysterious message on my phone.

616
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,600
It gave info about Chuto,

617
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,725
the rescue unit chief.

618
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,920
That's how I found out...

619
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,943
he killed my family.

620
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,040
And after digging deeper,

621
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,650
he was really the one who killed my family.

622
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,780
Then I waited for the right moment...

623
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,760
Do you remember me?

624
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,200
I asked, do you remember me?

625
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,400
Before I killed him...

626
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,740
After I killed him,

627
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,175
a feeling arose inside me...

628
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,175
A feeling that...

629
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,525
I wanted to keep killing,

630
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,050
and I couldn't stop it.

631
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,880
What's up, Wit?

632
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,120
Hello, Captain?

633
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,200
Um, l-l-last night,
someone broke into my house.

634
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,850
And I-I-I got into a fight with him
and accidentally stabbed him.

635
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,120
I'm not even sure if I killed him.

636
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,200
But when I woke up this morning
and checked, there was nothing.

637
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,720
Hold on, Wit. Compose yourself.
What's happening?

638
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,500
I'm sorry, Captain.

639
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,600
I...

640
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,200
I-I-I... uh, nothing.

641
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,320
I couldn't stop it...

642
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,225
so I...

643
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,200
kept killing.

644
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,275
I want to join your team
and help catch the killer.

645
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,560
No.

646
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,750
Why, Captain?

647
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,960
You have no experience.

648
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,560
The killer's a psychopath.
You're going to risk your life for nothing.

649
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,775
But I have to catch the killer.

650
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,725
He killed my friend, Captain.

651
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,020
- I've got to deal with him. Let go!
- Captain!

652
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,800
Somphol...

653
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,075
I'm here to bail out my guy.

654
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,120
Ah, the drunk-driving case.

655
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,480
- So your guy?
- Yeah.

656
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,040
I've seen your anti-alcohol,
anti-drug signs everywhere.

657
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,640
Didn't you let him read them?

658
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,360
Come on. Help me, Captain.

659
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,935
- How much should I pay?
- Enough.

660
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Drug dealing,

661
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,620
drunk driving, and someone's dead.

662
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,000
On-uma...

663
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,676
I'll expose everyone you sold to!

664
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,680
I'll spill it to the whole community! Hey guys!

665
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,720
Calm down, calm down.

666
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,920
This bitch used to sell herself.

667
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,280
No, no, no.
Can I hear the full story from the start?

668
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,520
Selling herself...

669
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,825
Help me! Help!

670
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,520
Help!

671
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,600
Help!

672
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,706
And sent the kids to the old men.

673
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,025
Help!

674
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,840
Help!

675
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,640
Help...

676
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,760
Help!

677
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,620
Help me!

678
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,240
Somebody help me!

679
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,140
Help!

680
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,280
Judge Nida...

681
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,760
Please remain calm. The court has ruled.
Have a seat.

682
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,640
- But your honor...
- Have a seat, please.

683
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,695
For the sake of the country, your honor.

684
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,425
Thank you, sir.

685
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,950
Bribery and injustice.

686
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,575
And Suthee...

687
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,920
You didn't want your friends punished,

688
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,450
so you offered to take the blame alone.

689
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,840
No, sir.

690
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,080
I just don't want any trouble.

691
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,640
Hey, I'm sorry...

692
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,200
for claiming I helped those two.

693
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,160
Seeing you help them
without a second thought...

694
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,850
I wanted to be like you.

695
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,420
My dear friend...

696
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,360
the deceiver.

697
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,725
When I did it,

698
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,280
I truly thought

699
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,350
I was doing good...

700
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,960
for the greater good.

701
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,775
Cleansing all the filth hiding in our society.

702
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,225
Just these two hands...

703
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,300
could make our city better.

704
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,875
It's me...

705
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,760
[Who do you think you are?
Watched too many movies?]

706
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,003
[I'm so confused, a cop or a criminal?]

707
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,250
I'm the sacrificial one...

708
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,640
and I'm...

709
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,760
the reaper for those bastards!

710
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,200
Or at least...

711
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,360
that's what I told myself

712
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,625
to justify killing again and again.

713
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,175
And Rashen...

714
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,800
Have you eaten yet?

715
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,720
Don't have time? It's okay.

716
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,660
Put it in the fridge.

717
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,000
I told myself...

718
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,443
he broke the fourth precept.

719
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,760
Is your brother...

720
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,840
doing good to cover something up?

721
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,120
I'll let your brother go,

722
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,240
if he admits the truth that...

723
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,960
he's been...

724
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,480
carrying anger, hatred,

725
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,396
and a desire for vengeance for everything
that's happened to him.

726
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,850
Just to kill him in cold blood.

727
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,360
Say it.

728
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,160
- Tell him.
- Say it.

729
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,760
- Admit it.
- Please.

730
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,520
You've carried anger,

731
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,320
a desire for vengeance,

732
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,360
and you've never forgiven it,
not even for a second.

733
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,240
Tell him!

734
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,420
Tell him! Just tell him, please.

735
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,440
You're angry that our parents died.

736
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,656
You're angry that you've got
a messed-up little brother like me.

737
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,080
Just tell him.

738
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,000
Please.

739
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,090
Please, just say it.

740
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,675
The truth is,

741
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,320
until his last breath,

742
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,160
Rashen...

743
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,250
stayed true to himself.

744
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,375
Thanks...

745
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,925
that you believe me.

746
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,800
I'm really sorry.

747
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,900
I'm so sorry,

748
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:32,059
Ramil.

749
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,210
I'm really sorry.

750
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,441
["Sorry" won't bring them back, dumbass.]

751
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:53,440
[That's manly,
but still deserves death penalty.]

752
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,040
[Guys like you should be executed.]

753
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,160
Don't judge others for how they think,
especially when you're wrong yourself!

754
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,875
You have no right to kill someone!

755
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,880
No! No! No!

756
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,145
Brother! Brother!

757
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,950
I'll kill you.

758
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,610
I'll fucking kill you!

759
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,280
- How did you lie to me?
- Ramil!

760
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,240
- How did you lie to me?
- I'm sorry, Captain!

761
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,040
- How the hell did you lie to me?
- I'm sorry!

762
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,960
OZ wants these children turned into killers.

763
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,923
Using humans as lab mice?

764
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,623
Is it handled yet?

765
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,880
Are you going to serve the corrupt politicians,

766
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,920
or serve the people?

767
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,000
Doctor, do you even know who's behind this?

768
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,880
I should've killed you from the start.

769
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,360
I have a secret...

770
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,000
I've never told anyone.

771
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,840
I saw the deaths of two victims.

772
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,640
No.

773
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:37,920
No.

774
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,050
No! I don't believe it!
