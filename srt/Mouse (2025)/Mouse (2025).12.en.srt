Congratulations on the new show.

6
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:43,134
Kill him.

7
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:47,373
Go on.

8
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:52,147
Kill him!

9
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,870
Wit, get inside. Please.

10
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,710
I'll raise Korn the best I can,
just like I raised Kan.

11
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,390
Kan.

12
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,309
Police.

13
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,149
What's going on?

14
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,549
What's up?

15
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,750
The DNA results from Sangchai's case
just came in, sir.

16
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,310
I asked how the hell you let them in!

17
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,989
The DNA test from the knife
used to kill Sangchai belongs to Boonsong, sir.

18
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,830
Then it's over.

19
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,749
Boonsong's dead.

20
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,270
Captain, where are we going?

21
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,590
Who is she?

22
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,069
Her name's Nilla.

23
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,950
She went missing.

24
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,789
So we're taking this case?

25
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:31,229
I'm not worried about that anymore, Grandma.

26
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,789
Wit takes really good care of me now.

27
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,790
I lost our bet, Grandma.

28
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,750
About Wit.

29
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,229
So you need to wake up soon.

30
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,030
I'm heading to work.

31
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:16,030
We'd like to ask a few more questions
about Nilla.

32
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,590
Nilla was a student at a private university.

33
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,429
I heard she had an older boyfriend.

34
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,790
He was planning to take her abroad with him.

35
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,510
Did you ever see this boyfriend?

36
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,349
Wait a minute.

37
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,830
Here.

38
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,309
Nilla's phone.

39
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:38,470
Wait, this is Nilla's phone?

40
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,950
- Yes.
- Why didn't she take it with her?

41
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,749
She said her boyfriend
was buying her a new one,

42
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:46,189
so she left this for me.

43
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:50,189
We'll need to take this phone as evidence,
if that's alright.

44
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,510
Okay.

45
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,189
Thank you.

46
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,009
Thank you, Uncle.

47
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,229
Excuse me.

48
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,989
I'm here to see Ms. Naruemon.

49
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,309
The head nurse isn't in today.

50
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,909
She's at an out-of-town seminar.

51
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,749
What about Ms. Somrudee?

52
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,109
No one's here. We're just filling in.

53
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:20,429
- So the whole department is gone?
- Yes.

54
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,856
Hello customers!

55
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,476
For a limited time only,

56
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:44,590
our mystery boxes start at just 599 baht.

57
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,950
You can win amazing prizes,
from small gold charms up to 10-baht gold bars.

58
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,189
And that's not all.

59
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:58,830
We're also giving away brand new motorcycles.

60
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,710
Police.

61
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,309
One moment, everyone.

62
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:06,830
Yaya will be right back. Just a second.

63
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,989
We need to ask you some questions
about Miss Parinda.

64
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,950
You were friends with her, right?

65
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,510
I knew her, but we weren't close.

66
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:28,360
Did she have problems or...

67
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,150
get into any arguments with anyone recently?

68
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,549
I don't know if she argued with anyone,

69
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:37,229
but if I had to guess,
I'd say it was loan sharks.

70
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,830
I used to see debt collectors shouting for her
out in front of the warehouse.

71
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,070
They were really loud.

72
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,910
But honestly, officer,
you're wasting your time here.

73
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,150
No one here was close to her.

74
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,210
Is there anything else?

75
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,840
- No.
- Okay. Thank you.

76
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,869
Kaneungha saw a lawyer
about filing an adultery lawsuit.

77
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:25,469
Parinda... was financially supporting
a male university student.

78
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:31,710
She saw a lawyer... about her debts
and a mystery box scam.

79
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,669
And Nilla, who had a sugar daddy,
was about to move abroad.

80
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,430
She saw a lawyer about getting married.

81
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,790
No matter what, Lawyer Patthapol
seems really suspicious to me.

82
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,189
Because he's connected to both cases.

83
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:50,429
He might even be involved in
Nilla's disappearance as well.

84
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,229
But...

85
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,150
Yes, Captain?

86
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,670
What's the motive?

87
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,750
I don't know if it's a coincidence,

88
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,349
but all of these cases
seem to revolve around affairs.

89
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,310
If he's a psychopath,

90
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,429
he'll definitely strike again.

91
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:30,579
So for now, we need to keep an eye
on Patthapol.

92
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,430
I'll handle that.

93
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,309
Hello? You want me to leave now?

94
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,830
Sure, see you later.

95
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,229
You bastard! Get out of my way! Move!

96
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,870
I need to search your vehicle.

97
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,990
Do you have a warrant?

98
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,429
Darn it.

99
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,229
You bastard!

100
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,149
Sorry about that.

101
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,669
Thank you for your cooperation.

102
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,110
You're just like me.

103
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,030
Alright, let's move it. On time, everyone.

104
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,150
Hurry up. The guest speaker is about to arrive.

105
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,069
Let's be on time.
Please head into the lecture hall.

106
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,950
Let's pick up the pace, please.

107
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

108
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,709
Let me help you with that.

109
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,829
It's an honor for our university to have you
speak to our students, Mr. Patthapol.

110
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,589
- The pleasure is all mine. Thank you.
- Right this way.

111
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,349
Hey, you three. Get up here.

112
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,109
Alright everyone, settle down, please.

113
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:00,869
Thank you all for being here today.

114
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,630
Before we begin,

115
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,589
I have a question for all of you.

116
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:10,049
Let's see if anyone in this room can answer.

117
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,400
The questions is this.

118
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,745
What are the legal limits of...

119
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:19,669
a police officer's authority...
when dealing with a suspect?

120
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,729
Who knows the answer?

121
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:28,590
If the cop is as handsome as you,
I'd volunteer as a suspect.

122
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,109
Thank you.

123
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,829
Okay, one more question.
And this one is serious.

124
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,096
Let's say...

125
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:44,150
you're accused of a crime you didn't commit.

126
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,030
What are your legal rights in that situation?

127
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,629
Does anyone know?

128
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,030
What did you do?

129
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,589
That lawyer, Patthapol, called me.

130
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,429
He said you searched his car.

131
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,790
And look at this.

132
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,030
He sent a messenger to drop off
his lecture notes for me.

133
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,110
Does he think I'm a student or something?

134
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,870
I thought he was about to flee, sir,
so I went to intercept him.

135
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,309
You two need to stop obsessing
over this psychopath nonsense.

136
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:45,270
From now on, you're working separately.

137
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,709
We can't do that, sir.

138
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:47,829
And why not?

139
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,790
These two cases are connected.

140
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,590
There could be other victims.

141
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:56,349
I don't know what kind of lead you have,

142
00:14:56,349 --> 00:15:00,069
but whatever it is,
don't let the press get wind of it.

143
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,877
Catch the killer first.

144
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,270
Then you can go on whatever talk show you want!

145
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,070
Yes, sir.

146
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,690
Are you going to read that?

147
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,109
Kill him.

148
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:43,109
You want to kill him, don't you? Then do it.

149
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:55,149
Wit, where are you going?

150
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,869
Why are you in such a hurry?

151
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:01,510
Take your medicine first.

152
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,829
I have to go check on something.

153
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,389
Can you take your medicine first?
You don't look well.

154
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:16,109
- Wit.
- Picha,

155
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,869
I'll be back.

156
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,229
Wait for me at home, okay?

157
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,470
You're burning up, Wit.

158
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,270
Take something for the fever.
Let me get it for you.

159
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,629
The police officers from yesterday
are waiting out front.

160
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:22,230
Did they go upstairs?

161
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,230
Not yet.

162
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,109
I'm going upstairs to work on a case file.

163
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:32,190
I won't be answering my phone.

164
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,670
If anyone calls, take a message.

165
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,470
Understood.

[Police Major Commits Suicide
After Wife Leaves Him]

167
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,600
Are you here for Chanya?

168
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,909
- Yes.
- She's in this room. You can go in.

169
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:07,709
Thank you.

170
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,470
Chanya, you have a visitor.

171
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,710
Hello.

172
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,629
Can I help you?

173
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,109
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

174
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:41,709
I found information suggesting this family
is connected to a suicide case.

175
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,629
But when I searched the police database,
I couldn't find any details.

176
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:52,109
Is this related to a case you're investigating?

177
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,470
Yes, with Captain Ramil.

178
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,869
Did Captain Ramil send you?

179
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,550
No, I came on my own.

180
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:13,270
Okay. I'll search the old news archives
for you.

181
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,070
Thank you very much.

182
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,640
- Wit.
- Yes?

183
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,830
Who taught you to do that sign language?

184
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,440
Sign language? No one.

185
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,240
Why?

186
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,030
The other day at the studio,
what did that sign you made mean?

187
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,670
I'm not sure, actually.

188
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,869
In that moment, I just felt the urge to do it.

189
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:14,430
My hand moved on its own.

190
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,850
I don't know what it meant.

191
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,669
Hey.

192
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,990
Hey.

193
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:25,049
Is something wrong?

194
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,187
No. It's just...

195
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:36,553
you remind me of someone.

196
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,990
If I find anything,
I'll contact you right away.

197
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,790
Thank you.

198
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:59,000
Is Mr. Patthapol in?

199
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,670
- Yes.
- I have urgent business with him.

200
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,430
It would be better if you came back later.

201
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,349
He said he's not seeing any visitors today.

202
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,670
I need to see him today.

203
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,990
I'm sorry, he insisted.
No calls and no visitors.

204
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,670
I can make an appointment for you.

205
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,349
Can you schedule an appointment for him?

206
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:17,761
Sir, please!

207
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:20,270
You can be charged with trespassing!

208
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,149
Sir, please stop!

209
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,629
Sir, you'll be charged with trespassing!

210
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,990
Sir, please stop!

211
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,790
You can't go in!

212
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,309
Wit.

213
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,109
I found it.

214
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,189
Miss, have you seen this woman around here?

215
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,109
Thank you.

216
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,349
I've missed you so much.

217
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,110
Of course I missed you, Note.

218
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,989
You never call me.

219
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,669
I've just been really busy.

220
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,029
I've been working to pay for tuition, Note.

221
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:31,389
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,070
I didn't want to be a bother.

223
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,309
You're not bothering me at all. It's fine.

224
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:42,110
- I just didn't want to impose.
- How do you want me to transfer the money?

225
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,550
If it's a bank transfer,
could you do it in the back?

226
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,189
Sure thing.

227
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:09,389
Miss, have you seen this woman around here?

228
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,189
No, I haven't.

229
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:28,826
Hey.

230
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:32,672
Is something wrong?

231
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,840
No.

232
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,700
No. It's just...

233
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,970
you remind me of someone.

234
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:16,269
Excuse me. Let me through.

235
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Help! Help me!

236
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:48,469
Mr. Patthapol, what are you doing here?

237
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:51,110
I had a meeting with a client nearby,

238
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,550
but I'm finished now.

239
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,790
What about you?

240
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,870
I just got off work.

241
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,909
Want to grab dinner?

242
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,709
My treat.

243
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,149
I actually forgot something at the university.
I have to go get it.

244
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,190
Alright, I'll come with you.

245
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,990
Okay.

246
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,230
I found her. I'm following her now.

247
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,530
Sending you the location.

248
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,909
Please wait here, Mr. Patthapol.

249
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:03,389
I'll be right back.

250
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:04,509
Hurry up.

251
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:06,990
Okay, wait here.

252
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,950
You can't. Someone might see us.

253
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,430
You can't, Mr. Patthapol.

254
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,910
Hey!

255
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,629
Hey, stop!

256
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,070
Stop!

257
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,389
What do you want from me?

258
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,849
Get out of my life.

259
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:11,429
You're the reason I'm this way!

260
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,430
Get out of my life.

261
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:16,429
Stop haunting me.

262
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,029
Get out of my life!

263
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:21,990
Get out!

264
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,990
Get out of my life!

265
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,110
How can I get out of your life?

266
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,350
I'm inside you, aren't I?

267
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,630
What the hell are you talking about?

268
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,909
Get out!

269
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:43,989
What the hell is so funny?

270
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,070
Go ahead, punch me.

271
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,910
What the hell?

272
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,629
I didn't know you could punch yourself.

273
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,990
Wit!

274
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,029
Wit.

275
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,229
Calm down.

276
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,796
[Ruamkatanyu Foundation]

277
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,109
Wit.

278
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,989
- Hello?
- Where the hell did Wit go last night?

279
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:44,469
Is he home?

280
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:47,070
Yes, he's home. He's resting now.

281
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,710
What's wrong with him?

282
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,590
I don't know.

283
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,349
He suddenly had a seizure and passed out.

284
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:55,989
Keep an eye on him.

285
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,989
If it gets any worse, take him to the hospital.

286
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,550
Call me if anything happens.

287
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,350
Okay.

288
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:43,120
Wit.

289
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,790
- Captain.
- Are you okay?

290
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,389
I'm fine. Really, there's nothing wrong.

291
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,790
You didn't show up last night,
so I called Picha.

292
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,150
She told me you were sick.

293
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,070
If you're not feeling well, just tell me.
You don't have to rush back to work.

294
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,230
No, I'm completely fine now, Captain.

295
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,509
Thank you for your concern.

296
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:06,309
Yes.

297
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:35,149
Chanya sent this over.

298
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,189
Yes.

299
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,750
Why were you in contact with Chanya?

300
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,230
And why didn't I know about it?

301
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,590
Today's top story.

302
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:10,309
A police major was abandoned by his wife,
leaving him for another man.

303
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:14,389
He reportedly tried to reconcile,
but she refused.

304
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:16,869
Locals say that not long after,

305
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:20,641
the wife gave him custody of their son,

306
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:26,590
and then committed suicide
by hanging with her new partner.

307
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,309
The heartbroken father
then hanged himself as well.

308
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,349
A true tragedy for the child left behind.

309
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:36,870
We can only hope
for a positive outcome for him.

310
00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:46,630
Patthapol's mother and her new husband
hanged themselves.

311
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,669
Then his father did the same.

312
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:55,589
What are you getting at?

313
00:48:57,627 --> 00:48:59,520
It's suspicious, Captain.

314
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,710
His father may have had a motive for suicide,

315
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,630
but his mother and her new husband didn't.

316
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:15,630
Which makes me wonder if their deaths
were staged to look like suicides.

317
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,750
The nurse, Kaneungha, also died by hanging.

318
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,429
And when Parinda's body was found,
there were ligature marks on her neck.

319
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:29,869
In every single one of these hanging cases,

320
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:33,669
Patthapol was connected to the victim.

321
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,349
Are you suggesting Patthapol
murdered his own parents

322
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,829
and his mother's new husband?

323
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,590
I'm just saying the cases from 20 years ago
and the ones now are all connected.

324
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,366
There's a high probability
that the killer is the same person.

325
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,910
If that lawyer is the killer...

326
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,790
Psychopaths won't stay quiet for long.

327
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,829
He'll strike again.

328
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:41,630
This is Khing. She's an acting coach, Captain.

329
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,029
- Hello.
- I've already briefed her.

330
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,979
Is there anything you want to add, Captain?

331
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:56,509
Are you sure you can do this
without making him suspicious?

332
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:58,190
She studied acting in the US.

333
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,710
There's no way Patthapol will suspect anything.

334
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,750
I've never done anything like this before,
but I promise you,

335
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,629
I won't mess up your plan.

336
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:12,190
Don't worry.

337
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,909
When you're with Patthapol, we'll be nearby.

338
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,949
If anything happens, we can get to you
in under two minutes.

339
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:22,389
You'll be wearing a hidden camera.

340
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:25,669
If something goes wrong,
we're ready to move in.

341
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:38,230
Okay.

342
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,391
Then let's get everything ready.

343
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:41,710
We can't screw this up.

344
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,510
Right.

345
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,570
Here's your coffee.

346
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:08,550
And for you.

347
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,350
Thanks.

348
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,496
Go. Go on.

349
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:23,749
Get out.

350
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:33,669
Okay.

351
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:40,029
To be honest, my husband is incredibly boring.

352
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:44,829
I'm this pretty
and spent a fortune to get this body,

353
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:47,529
and he never pays any attention to me.

354
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:53,550
If I file for divorce,
what grounds could I use?

355
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,390
Has he ever...
been physically violent with you?

356
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:14,030
He slapped me once and called me a slut.

357
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:29,829
You'll need evidence for that.

358
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:32,149
It's a complex matter.

359
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,429
Do you have some time?

360
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:37,229
Yes.

361
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,849
[Wed & Sun]

362
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,829
Alright, I'll see you later today.

363
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:59,070
- Okay.
- Let's get dinner. My treat.

364
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:41,269
Do you think I'll win the case?

365
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,789
Absolutely.

366
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:56,989
You haven't touched your drink.

367
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:59,590
That's because I'm driving.

368
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,109
I'm putting my trust in you.

369
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:09,789
And that includes for tonight, too.

370
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,550
We're here.

371
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,870
Watch your step.

372
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,200
- How's it going?
- Right here.

373
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,590
Have another drink.

374
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,070
Where's he going? Is he getting a knife?

375
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,430
Hold on. If we're wrong, we'll blow our cover.

376
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,430
Shit!

377
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:21,469
- Get the key for Room 405.
- You can't go in there.

378
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:25,269
- Shinohm.
- Police! Get the key. Now!

379
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,230
Watch the video.
This woman is about to be killed!

380
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,509
A killer is attacking a woman.

381
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:32,510
She could die. Give us the key, now!

382
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,350
Hurry!

383
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:52,749
Go!

384
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:29,270
Check on the victim.
- Copy that.
- I'll go check the bathroom.

385
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,360
- Khing!
- He's not in the bathroom!

386
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,750
- How is she?
- She's still breathing.

387
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,350
- Call an ambulance.
- On it.

388
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,429
Yes.

389
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:42,909
Hello, we have an emergency.

390
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,670
If you're so tough, follow me, you idiot.

391
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,309
Come and get me, if you dare!

392
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:16,870
Come on. Bring it on!

393
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,870
You're just like me.

394
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,870
Kill him.

395
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:22,749
You want to kill him, right?
Then do it. Kill him.

396
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:41,950
Captain.

397
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:05,550
Hello, Lieutenant.
The captain has been injured.

398
01:02:13,389 --> 01:02:15,630
The doctor says his condition is improving.

399
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,149
He'll probably be moved out of the ICU soon.

400
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:24,510
And don't worry,
I'll take care of all the hospital bills.

401
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,270
Thank you, officer.

402
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:31,550
Thank you for taking care of everything.

403
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,309
What have I done?

404
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,110
What happened?

405
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:07,230
That patient is being reckless.

406
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,989
The doctor didn't discharge him,
but he insists on leaving.

407
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:13,789
If something happens,
he shouldn't come crawling back here.

408
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,150
Why did you do that, Captain?

409
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,950
It's fine.

410
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:24,789
Are you in pain?

411
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,450
It's not too bad.

412
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:38,510
But it was worth it. At least now we have proof
that Patthapol is the culprit.

413
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:49,389
- Captain.
- Yeah?

414
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:51,510
That's my coffee.

415
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:55,709
Thanks.

416
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,770
And what about Shinohm?

417
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,949
He's not doing so good.

418
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:16,149
He feels incredibly guilty
for getting Khing involved in this.

419
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,709
- Captain.
- Yeah?

420
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:31,430
Do you think we went too far?

421
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,989
I've reviewed the X-rays.

422
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,190
You can go home soon.

423
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:49,230
Just make sure you come back
for your follow-up appointment.

424
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:51,869
Thank you, Doctor.

425
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:53,270
Not you.

426
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,469
You're the stubborn one.

427
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:59,150
You never listen to the doctors or the nurses.

428
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:03,270
With a concussion like that,
how can you even think about going home?

429
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,389
You're staying here.

430
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:07,689
And listen to the nurses.

431
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:12,070
How is he, Doctor?

432
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:15,389
What can I say?
He's stubborn, so he has to stay.

433
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:18,950
- Stubborn?
- Extremely. Please look after your friend.

434
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,349
Come on, Wit, I'll take you home.

435
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:23,590
Thanks.

436
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,710
And how's Khing?

437
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:28,190
She's safe.

438
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,710
So, you're being stubborn, Captain?

439
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,829
It's a good thing
the doctor is making you stay.

440
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,429
I'll call Tawee to keep you company.

441
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,590
Hey! Why are you taking that off?

442
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,309
I'm not.

443
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:43,909
It's itchy.

444
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:46,389
Maybe it's an allergic reaction.

445
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,949
Wit, where were you all night?

446
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,749
And...

447
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,190
what happened to you?

448
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:05,150
The captain and I ran into some trouble,

449
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:07,110
so we ended up at the hospital.

450
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:10,327
Sorry I didn't call.

451
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:12,150
Things got a little chaotic.

452
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,909
And the captain still has to stay here.

453
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:16,709
Are you hurt?

454
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:21,710
It's nothing.

455
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:27,470
The doctor said I can take this off
when I shower, so it's not a big deal.

456
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,829
And what about Mil?

457
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:37,710
He has to stay in the hospital
for a couple more days.

458
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,560
But the doctor said it's nothing serious.

459
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:49,750
I was planning to visit grandma
and Mil after work,

460
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,204
but...

461
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:54,710
I'll just stay here and look after you today.

462
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,510
It's okay.

463
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,950
You should go.

464
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:02,393
I'm fine.

465
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:05,189
Are you sure?

466
01:07:07,909 --> 01:07:12,710
Okay, I'll head to work then.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

467
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,510
Okay.

468
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:29,349
I'm not sure, sir.

469
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:32,630
When was the last time you saw him?

470
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,350
The last time was yesterday evening.

471
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:15,149
Why is this thing so hard to get off?

472
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:16,949
Sir, you can't take that off!

473
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:18,350
I have to use the bathroom,
and this is in the way.

474
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,676
Either you take it off,

475
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:21,802
- or I'll do it myself.
- Okay, I'll help you to the bathroom.

476
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:24,269
It's okay, I'll take him.

477
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:26,561
Okay, then.

478
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,989
Come on, I'll help you.

479
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:37,109
You're not going anywhere.

480
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:38,909
I'm going home.

481
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:44,949
You can't go home.
The doctor ordered you to stay.

482
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:51,229
What did you two get into
to both end up injured like this?

483
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,270
Didn't Wit tell you?

484
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,270
If he had, would I be asking you?

485
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,949
Nurse!

486
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,150
Mil.

487
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,370
Keep your voice down,
you're bothering the other patients.

488
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:18,109
Nurse!

489
01:10:18,109 --> 01:10:21,470
Mil, you're being loud.

490
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,510
It's embarrassing.

491
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,949
Sorry about that.

492
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,350
Captain, I've tracked down Patthapol.

493
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,390
What?

494
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:28,029
I'm not scared of you,

495
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:29,390
loser.

496
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,590
She deserved to die!

497
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,830
Deserved to die? You monster!

498
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:39,989
Just answer me this.

499
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:42,630
Did you perform my brain surgery?

500
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,510
I was in prison.

501
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:47,029
How could I have performed your surgery?

502
01:11:47,029 --> 01:11:48,410
If not you,

503
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,869
no one else in this country could've done it.

504
01:11:50,869 --> 01:11:54,750
No father would let his son die.

505
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,310
What did you say?

506
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,829
You're lying!

507
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:01,710
I don't know what you're talking about,

508
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,790
but I'm not your mother.

509
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:07,270
Doctor said grandma's getting better.

510
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:14,709
When the part of your brain
with the killer gene activates,

511
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,590
you start craving an outlet
for your murderous instincts.

512
01:12:23,829 --> 01:12:25,629
You're here?
