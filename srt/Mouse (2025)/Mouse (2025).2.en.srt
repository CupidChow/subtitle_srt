there may be only one

32

- Pimri, don't move.
- Wait a moment, Pimri.

54
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,169
Pimri, stay still.

55

Pimri.

56
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,409
Stay still.

57
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,690
Pimri.

58
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,289

61

And this is Pimri.

What's your name?

63
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,729
Oh, I'm Wit.

64
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,130
So, can I have your Line ID?

66
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,250

68
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,450
In that case, you can just call 191.

72
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,169
Have you got nothing better to do
than stick your nose in my business?

73
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,849
You're breaking the law.

74
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,930
She's my kid. I can do whatever I want.

75
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,770
Calm down... What's going on here?

76
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,049
It's my kid! She ran away from home,
and when I finally tracked her down,

77
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:10,409
I found out this woman
has been brainwashing her!

78
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,770
She said she's taking her to join some
"women's empowerment club."

79
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,849
That sounds like a scam, doesn't it?

80
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:16,890
A scam?

81
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,930
The girl told me everything.

82
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,130
You forced her into prostitution.

83
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,890
People took a liking to her.

84
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,649
They wanted to take her out,
treat her to nice food...

85
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,250
What's wrong with that?

86
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,850
What's wrong is that you took money for it.

87
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,289

88
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,090

89
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,169
You act like you've never done it yourself.

90
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,610
I'll tell everyone who you sold yourself to.

91
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,396
- I'll tell this whole community!
- Hey, everyone...

92
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,329
Calm down, sir. Calm down.

93
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,649
This bitch used to be a prostitute.

94
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,409
No, no, no...
Can I please hear this from the beginning?

95
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:51,049
Because I'm completely lost.

96
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,729
Don't make me say it.

97
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,169
Or do you want me to?

98
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,236
Hey, let's talk this out first!

99
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:00,569
Alright, go ahead.

100
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:02,850
Okay, I'll tell you.

101
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,449
Everyone here knows what this woman used to do.

102
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,809
Listen up... she used to be a prostitute.

103
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,490
She was involved with so many men.

104
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,012
This whole "good person" act is just a front.

105
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,621
I heard a dog barking all night.

106
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,501
I couldn't get any sleep.

107
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:37,700
I don't hear a dog.
All I hear right now is you.

108
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,141
Careful, or I'll bite your head off.

109
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,221
- I'm already irritated.
- Oh, an officer. Perfect timing.

110
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,540
Officer, over here, please.

111
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,661
Please, sir.

112
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,300
- What's the problem?
- Her.

113
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,961
My neighbor's dog barks every single night.

114
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,820
It's keeping me awake.

115
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,381
Have you spoken to the owner?

116
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,660
Of course I have. I've said everything.

117
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,340
And what did they say?

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,101
He said it's "a dog's business."

119
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,141
That was his way of insulting me, officer.

120
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,401
It's because the dog is locked up all day.

121
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,501
That's why it barks.

122
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:13,526
Alright then,

123
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,741
I'll call the animal
welfare society to report it.

124
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,820
Oh, wonderful! Yes, please. Thank you so much.

125
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,500
You're welcome, ma'am.

126
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,861

130

131
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,090
two basil chicken stir-fries with fried eggs.

132
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,289
- Got it.
- Ow, hot!

133
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,169
Okay, have a seat.

134
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:57,010

135
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,689
Why not?

136
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,329

137

142
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,569
Beautiful?

143
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,118
She looks...

144
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,890
the same as always.

145
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:36,692
How can you say that? She's gorgeous.

146
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,409
Beautiful and cute, as always.

147
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:42,250
I like that. I like that.

Why not?

150

Oh, I forgot.

154
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,649
I completely forgot he ordered food.

155
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,890
Hold on, just a minute.

- Just a moment, just a moment.

157
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,690

159

to make Maga One City a crime-free city.

160
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,090

to keep things peaceful for everyone.

- Okay.

169
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,336
- Be careful.
- Hey, what's happening?

170
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,210
He's chasing a thief over there.
I don't really know.

171
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,890
Another incident?

172
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,409
Oh no... the bike just died on him.

Ugh... you've got to be kidding me.

Huh. I thought they said
there would be no more crime.

Stop!

In this incident,

184
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:27,090
- one person was found dead at the scene.
- Hey, are you okay?

185
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,370
It's believed that they fell from a height.

186
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,289
The cause of death appears to be the impact.

187
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,169
We'll have more updates in our next segment.

188
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:35,010
So why did he jump?

189
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,569
I'm not sure if he jumped
or if something else happened.

190
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,929
When did you see him jump?

191
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,796
I only saw him when he was already falling.

192
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,210
Hey Wit, isn't that you over there?

193
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,810
The one throwing up?

194
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,649
What a mess.

195
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,170
What are you doing here?

196
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,409
It's me.

197
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,529
Here.

198
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,490
Captain.

199
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,289
Why don't you spend the night here?

200
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,329
Why the hell would I?

201
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:44,871
The evidence.

202
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,770
If you didn't do it, bring us proof.

203
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,205
Wait, you're putting me in a cell?

204
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:51,529
How am I supposed to find evidence then?

205
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,770
And do you have any proof that I pushed him?

206
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,089
Wit...

207
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,210
He saw it.

208
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,650
You darn kid...

209
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,797
Did you really see me push him?

210
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,889
Huh?

211
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:10,170
Hey, Lieutenant.

212
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,170
This way, Captain.

213
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,089
Just spend one night. We'll wait for Jong.

214
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,719
Are you guys serious?

215
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,079
This way, please.

216
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,919
Wow, all together now.

217
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,119
You guys must be satisfied now, huh?

218
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,479
This way, please.

220

[No prior record found]

221
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:11,558
Captain.

222
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,159
- Ah, there you are.
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:26,986
How much was it again?

224
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,318
Just a second.

225
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,399
- I forgot.
- 144 baht, ma'am.

226
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,038
One hundred forty-four, right.

227
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,958
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

228
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,639
Here you go.

229
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:37,959
Thanks, ma'am.

230
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,439
Thank you.

231
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,598
I might be a bit late tomorrow.

232
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,639
Oh? Why? Where are you off to?

233
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,878
I have another delivery to make.

234
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:46,959
- Okay, okay.
- Auntie!

235
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,959
- Need something?
- One fried rice to go.

236
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,878
- Okay, one box. With a fried egg?
- Yes, please.

237
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:54,078
Alright, I'll give you an extra egg,
on the house.

238
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,199
Lots of extras.

239
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,199
You got it.

240
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,599
Wait, just a moment.

241
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:09,118
- Okay, Auntie.
- Here, I'll add extra pork for you, too.

242
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:10,358
Lots more, add more.

243
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,159
Sure thing.

244
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,719
Hey.

245
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,239
What are you doing?

246
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,318
Nothing.

247
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:26,919
Grandma's phone was ringing,
I was just going to answer it.

248
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,759
I don't believe you. Let me see that.

249
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,078
Hi, Grandma.

250
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,558
Hi.

251
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,292
Officer, come arrest this little liar!

252
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,412
What's going on with them?

253
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,798
So you're not staying to eat with me?

254
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:02,199
I already ate, Grandma.

255
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,439
Okay, then.

256
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:05,999
And Picha...

257
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,399
Oh, yes. Picha!

258
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,558
Picha, come and eat first!

259
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,159
Get up, hurry.

260
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,919
Can't you go a day without causing trouble?

261
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,749
The Prime Minister announced a policy.

262
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:03,639
A crime-free, non-violent society.

263
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,319
And look what you did!

264
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:06,999
What?

265
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,159
I was chasing a criminal...

266
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,838
for that crime-free society.

267
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:15,719
Oh, so you became the criminal yourself!

268
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,598
Chief, the reporters are all waiting outside.

269
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,798
The victim's relatives are all here too.

270
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,759
What the hell are they here for?

271
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,278
They're here to confront the Captain, sir.

272
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,278
See?

273
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,239
I'll go.

274
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,518
No!

275
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,198
I'll handle it myself.

276
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:37,159
Hey, hey, wait.
The reporters won't understand you.

277
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,919
Chief, I'll go with you.

278
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,118
Oh, there they are.

279
00:22:44,118 --> 00:22:45,358
Commander Banjong... Sir!

280
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:46,399
Calm down, everyone.

281
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,878
Would you say the police used excessive force?

282
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,479
Why did it have to end
in an extrajudicial killing?

283
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,944
Witnesses say Captain Ramil
threw the suspect off the building.

284
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:56,719
- What really happened?
- Please answer us, sir.

285
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,038
Everyone, please calm down.

286
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,159
Okay... hold on!

287
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,879
Hello? Yes, sir... Yes, sir.

288
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,439
- Sir, please come back!
- Give us an answer.

289
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,919
Everyone, please stay calm. Please.

290
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,681
- But you said--
- Our police officers are

291
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,959
doing their best.

292
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,358
Didn't you say society would be crime-free?

293
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,199
If he was your kid,

294
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,479
would you still have the guts to say that?

295
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,518
That's right! Answer the question!

296
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,078
Please, calm down.

297
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:21,959
Sir, please answer. What happened?

298
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,118
Stop!

299
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,903
Captain Ramil did not push
the suspect to his death.

300
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,439
What? Do you have evidence?

301
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:36,918
I have proof.

302
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,639
I'm sending it to all of you now.

303
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,598
Bring it on!

304
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:13,878
- Well? Anything else?
- This is impossible.

305
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:15,598
Any more questions?

306
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:16,798
Are we clear?

307
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,294
- Yes, all clear. No more questions.
- Go on, feel free to ask.

308
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,479
We've got our answer, sir.

309
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,072
Thank you, sir.

310
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:26,719
- Goodbye, sir.
- Bye, sir.

311
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,999
This can't be...

312
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:29,999
Why did they only send it to us now?

313
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,993
Whoa, Chief, you just left us in the dust.

314
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:33,364
Should've sent this to us earlier.

315
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:36,308
Right, back to work. It's like this every day.

316
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:43,760
You have a mouth but you don't use it!

317
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,624
You always let someone else speak for you.

318
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:48,344
Who are you talking about?

319
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:49,624
Chanya!

320
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:54,904
If you'd just told me
the suspect jumped on his own,

321
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,665
I wouldn't have had to stand there
and get torn apart by the reporters.

322
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:00,104
And when was I supposed to get a word in?

323
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:02,304
You were talking the whole time
and didn't listen to anyone.

324
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:06,464
Next time, let me finish speaking
before you start yelling, okay?

325
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:14,104
Wait. So this is my fault now? Really?

326
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,224
Oh... no, sir.

327
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,384
Hey, Rashen.

328
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,425
Hey, Wit.

329
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:23,505
Rashen,

330
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:26,897
who all is joining the volunteer event
at the prison?

331
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:29,624
The prison event? Yeah, the usual crew.

332
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:33,865
But this year, I was thinking
we should put on a performance.

333
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,384
Wow!

334
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:37,064
The prison requested it.

335
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,105
That sounds good.

336
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,465
Let me help.

337
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,832
- I should get going then.
- Go and take a break.

338
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,025
I booked in advance, Teacher.

339
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,665
Why can't we use the space?

340
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:04,144
The Women's Friends Association
requested to use the area for an event.

341
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:05,425
What event?

342
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:08,864
"Teen Moms and Sex Education Awareness."

343
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,745
What does that have to do with me?

344
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,624
I need to use that space.

345
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,544
But it was the Director's order.

346
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,544
Excuse me, is there a problem?

347
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:21,624
Why don't you come and take a look?

348
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:25,784
Today we're offering free HPV vaccines
to prevent cervical cancer.

349
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:31,104
A program like this is for virgins.

350
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:33,785
Picha wouldn't be interested.

351
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:37,584
Oh please, Prae. As if you're so pure!

352
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,011
What about it?

353
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:48,589
What's your problem, bitch?

354
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:51,326
What the hell do you want from me?

355
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,584
Come here!

356
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:54,174
That's enough.

357
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:55,447
Let go!

358
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,264
My apologies, everyone.

359
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:07,512
Everyone, calm down.
Let's go get in line for the vaccine.

360
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:15,344
Let go, you're hurting me.

361
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,745
Why are you getting involved?

362
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,904
I'm trying to keep you

Hey, hey...

00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:25,376
Why are you so stubborn?
Do you want to get Grandma in trouble?

- Come on.
- Where are we going?

Who did you get in a fight with?

371
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:12,544
A person.

372
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:17,505
Right. If it were a dog,
it wouldn't have left a gash like that.

373
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,705
Look at her. See? This is what she's like.

Wit, can you please look after her?

375
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,785
Of course, Grandma.

Does it hurt?

387

That's enough.

Stop fooling around.

Nope.

The cause of death.

Why did he jump?

416
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:25,477
Or did you pressure him?

417
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
I didn't.

418
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,980
Then why did he jump?

419

- Are you going or not?
- Yeah, whatever.

Nop, what do we have?

431
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,141
The deceased is Chuto Phakdeepathummat, age 43.

432
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,341
He worked as a rescue team leader

433
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:36,808
and was formerly the head of a boxing club.

434
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:40,981
The body was found badly burned,

435
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,621
with stab wounds to the abdomen.

436
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,260
There was a medal in the victim's mouth

437
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,460
and a slash mark on his forehead.

438
00:33:58,843 --> 00:34:04,061
And... a gold leaf was found on his back.

439
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:06,380
A gold leaf?

440
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:16,768
The killer must have been hiding inside.

441
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,181
The killer must have excellent combat skills.

442
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,125
The victim was a former youth boxing champion.

443
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,828
The victim shows signs
of having been both beaten and stabbed.

444
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,564
The killer burned the body to destroy evidence.

445
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,608
I'm suspicious about the medal in his mouth

446
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,914
and the slash mark on his forehead.

447

the killer is trying to send?

Hey, Ramil.

475
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,541
The victim was slashed across the abdomen,

476
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,501
with barbed wire wrapped tightly
around her body.

477
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,581
And there's a slash mark on her forehead.

Her name was On-uma.

She was a volunteer who helped women
lured into sex trafficking.

486

Just like the last victim?

487

What does the killer want?

488
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:40,365
Could this be a conflict
with an influential figure?

489
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,820
We can't be sure yet.

00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,780

491
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,460
How much longer will you need
to collect the evidence?

492
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,260
The killer is a psychopath.

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,980

- But that case was 25 years ago.
- Right.

01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,815
Come on...

729
01:05:16,815 --> 01:05:18,855
Really, it's okay, Grandma.

730
01:05:18,855 --> 01:05:19,935
Hold him still, Picha.

731
01:05:19,935 --> 01:05:21,860
Good job, Picha.

732
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,340
Hurry up so he can go home.

733
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,722
Hold still. How did this come off?

734
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,880
Okay, got it... There.

735
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:46,999
- Are you done, Grandma?
- Almost, almost... Just a little more.

736
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,547
Grandma doesn't have a black one,

737
01:05:49,547 --> 01:05:51,947
so I used a white one instead, okay?

738
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:05,519
Thanks for the ride.

739
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,319
Hey... wait.

740
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:25,519
What is it?

741
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,440
The light in your room.

742
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:33,479
Oh... I must have forgotten
to turn it off this morning.

743
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:34,959
Oh.

744
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:36,079
Get home safe.

Everything seems normal.

01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,800
You can't catch the real killer,

750
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,560
so you're going to pin it on a scapegoat?

751
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,560
Pathetic,

752
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,640
you orphan brat.

753
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,039
I'm an orphan because of you!

This bastard's going to get
what he deserves! Let go!

So it was you who started talking
about psychopaths.

Now the public is in a panic.

How are you going to take
responsibility for this?

758

I've already taken care of it.

You killed my son?

What are you doing here?

761
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:06,972
Grandma sent me to check on you.
