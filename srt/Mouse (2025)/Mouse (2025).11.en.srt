Her family member came to file a report.

366
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,960
She's been missing for several days now.

367
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,400
If it gets media coverage,
we might be able to find her faster.

368
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,280
So she'll be able to go back
and see her family at home.

369
00:58:22,025 --> 00:58:25,800
Uncle.

370
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:33,440
Maybe your daughter is still alive
somewhere out there.

371
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,318
I also hope that...

372
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:45,896
someday...

373
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:50,520
I'll be able to see her face again.

374
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,440
Don't give up, please.

375
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,720
And don't forget to peel the apples for Auntie.

376
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,280
Thank you so much.

377
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:33,120
[Maga One City Police Station]

378
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,280
Hello.

379
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,000
You got the file I sent, right?

380
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,840
Yes, thank you very much.

381
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,400
If you'll excuse me.

382
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,800
Sure.

383
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,770
Don't you have work to do?

384
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:49,962
Kan.

385
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,960
Kan.

386
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,200
Are you okay?

387
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,245
I'm...

388
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:19,480
I'm fine.

389
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,080
What are you doing here?

390
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,440
I just saw you.

391
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:52,838
Same place as always?

392
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,120
What are you following up on?

393
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,185
The Gold Leaf Killer case.

394
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:18,610
Why?

395
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,040
This girl went missing.

396
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,900
Inspector Pitak asked me
to get her case on the news.

397
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,525
What do you think?

398
01:05:36,986 --> 01:05:39,950
Hey, Yai.

399
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,000
What's that woman doing here?

400
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,920
Her roommate went missing.
She hasn't been able to contact her.

401
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,040
She said it's been days now,
so she came to report it.

402
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,480
Inspector Pitak said this photo was provided
by her relatives.

403
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,120
The last message she sent said she was abroad,

404
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,560
so the police dropped the case.

405
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,640
Even though the case was closed two years ago,

406
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:13,040
for me, it can't end like this.

407
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,425
Relatives.

408
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,200
If you want to find the truth,

409
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,120
I won't stop you.

410
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:38,825
But don't do anything reckless,
it could come back to hurt you.

411
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:08,120
What are you looking for?

412
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,530
You look tense.

413
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:13,075
There's DNA on the knife handle
from the crime scene.

414
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:17,300
But it's not Picha's.

415
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,200
So,

416
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,360
are you trying to trace the killer's DNA?

417
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,200
The killer doesn't have a criminal record,

418
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,640
so it's really hard to track him down.
No suspects to test the DNA against.

419
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,280
Is it still necessary
to continue the investigation?

420
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:45,800
Even if I have to search the whole world,
if the captain orders it, I'll do it.

421
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,575
My head hurts.

422
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,280
I'm returning this evidence, sir.

423
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,480
Just put it here. I'll put it away myself.

424
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,920
I'll help you put it away.

425
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:32,173
Thanks.

426
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,400
Yes.

427
01:11:01,944 --> 01:11:05,519
Yes, Captain.

428
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:11,150
Ever since you transferred here,
the captain hasn't called me even once.

429
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,600
Have I been benched already?

430
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,920
No, i-i-it's not like that. Don't overthink it.

431
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,800
It's just that the two cases I'm working on
are connected, so I need to assist the captain.

432
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,880
- I'm joking.
- Uh.

433
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,925
Hurry up, or he's going to chew you out.

434
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,453
- Sorry I'm late, sir.
- Why are you so late?

435
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:47,760
I had a flat tire.

436
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,000
- Let's go.
- Can I leave my helmet in your car?

437
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:07,240
Do you have an appointment?

438
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,850
We're the police. We need to talk
to Lawyer Patthapol about a case.

439
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,640
Uh, do you have an appointment?
If not, today might be--

440
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,120
I need to see him now.

441
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
- But if there's no appointment today--
- I said now.

442
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:22,280
Uh, let me check.

443
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:28,575
- Wit.
- Yes, sir.

444
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:40,686
Police.

445
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:45,417
What's going on?

446
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:49,042
I have to use the bathroom first.

447
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,616
Did you know Nurses Kaneungha and Parinda?

448
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,724
Well?

449
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:23,080
Yes.

450
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,040
They were my clients.

451
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,480
They came in for a consultation,

452
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,440
but it never went to litigation.

453
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,320
I just found out that they... died.

454
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,003
Where were you...

455
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:46,200
on the day of the incident?

456
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,760
Hey, are you suspecting me now? Huh?

457
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,300
Where were you that day?

458
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,480
I was in another province for a case.

459
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,160
I can confirm my whereabouts.

460
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,750
In that case, we would like to have
your contact number.

461
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,960
So basically, we got no new evidence
beyond what we already have.

462
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,480
Captain, look at this.

463
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,360
These two phone numbers, they don't match.

464
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,640
Look at this.

465
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,320
This is more interesting.

466
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:09,200
What's up?

467
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,346
The DNA results from Sangchai's case
just came in, sir.

468
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:14,604
Okay.

469
01:15:14,604 --> 01:15:18,004
Let's go.

470
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,450
How did you let them get in here?

471
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:42,560
Um... I...

472
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,720
I asked how the hell you let them in!

473
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,833
- I'm sorry--
- Get out!

474
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,389
- Yes, sir.
- Darn it!

475
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:55,789
Darn!

476
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:25,080
How's it going?

477
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:30,480
The DNA test from the knife
used to kill Sangchai belongs to Boonsong, sir.

478
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,200
Then it's over.

479
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,800
Boonsong's dead.

480
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:05,920
Scoundrel!

481
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,720
No matter what, Lawyer Patthapol
seems really suspicious to me.

482
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,160
Because he's connected to both cases.

483
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:16,360
He might even be involved in
Nilla's disappearance as well.

484
01:17:31,724 --> 01:17:33,520
Okay.

485
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,800
Then let's get everything ready.

486
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,916
- Don't mess this one up.
- Yes.

487
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,225
What do you want from me?

488
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:49,625
Huh?

489
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,480
We want the key to Room 405!

490
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,760
That woman is about to be murdered!

491
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,320
You're just like me.
