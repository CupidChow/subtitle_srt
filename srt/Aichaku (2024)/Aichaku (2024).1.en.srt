Ah, Lucas!

21
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,888
Oh! Good morning Yoshiko.

22
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,702
Good morning Marie.

23
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,086
Good morning!

24
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:41,064
Marie, say hello to him in English.

25
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,489
Good. Morning.

26
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,151
After all that time living abroad...

27
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:52,010
What did you do in America for four years?

28
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,435
Lucas, do you need a ride to school?

29
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,616
No, I'm fine.

30
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:57,917
Are you sure?

31
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,110
Yeah!

32
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,782
No problem.

33
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:07,079
Let him go. You know he wants to stop
at that building.

34
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,673
His bag is falling apart.
That bike is, too.

35
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,888
I wish he'd let us help more.

36
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:13,978
Let's go.

37
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,861
Thank you.

38
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,424
Do you know him?

39
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,000
No.

40
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,733
Sometimes I see him handing out fliers
for the English school at the station.

41
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:47,846
He's probably stalking you.

42
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:51,531
If you're not careful he's going to show up
at your house one day.

43
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:53,947
Shut up.

44
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:59,446
One day you'll look outside and there will
be a foreigner in your driveway.

45
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,510
Just waiting for you to come out.

46
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,812
He's going to kidnap you and force you
to learn English.

47
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,430
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,588
Alright, today we are going to be working
on self-introductions.

49
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:42,777
I'll go first.

50
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,597
How do you do?
My name is Lucas.

51
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,105
I'm from America.

52
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,513
I'm 35 years old.

53
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,905
My hobby is baking.

54
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:55,283
Nice to meet you.

55
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,292
The whole point of a self-introduction

56
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:05,154
is to give you and your conversational
partner something to talk about.

57
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:08,030
Make sure to think of them
and remember.

58
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,359
Don't be shy.

59
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,653
Now, you have five minutes to prepare
your own self-introduction.

60
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:21,003
When the five minutes are up, you will
come up here and present them to the class.

61
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,163
Begin.

62
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,990
Morning!

63
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,833
I just need your signature on your
visa paperwork.

64
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,053
We are still waiting for your contract
from the home office, though.

65
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:35,628
Sorry it's taking so long.

66
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:39,138
Oh, that's ok. I think I've still got
two weeks left on my visa.

67
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,075
I'm just hoping for more than a
one year extension this time.

68
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Fucking visas.

69
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,436
Lucas! Language!

70
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,055
Sorry, fricking! Fricking visas,
everybody. Fricking.

71
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:50,664
- Better.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,230
And sign here.

73
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:57,627
Hey, how is registration looking.
Are we doing ok?

74
00:06:57,857 --> 00:07:00,863
Not great, but I think we're
in the clear.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,902
I've got a meeting with the home office
tonight to talk with them about it.

76
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,713
And I'll make sure to remind them about
your contract.

77
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,005
Hey, Erika!

78
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,500
Do you want to hand some some more
fliers later or something?

79
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,126
You just want me to buy you a coffee,
don't you?

80
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:19,323
I mean, it can be both things. We can have
coffee and save the school.

81
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,969
Better you than some guy on a dating app.

82
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:23,877
Bye!

83
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:27,368
Alright, time is almost up!

84
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,751
Come in.

85
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,919
Oh, Ken.

86
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,009
Finally.

87
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,037
Sit.

88
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,404
Your father...

89
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:15,134
You know he never lost a single match?

90
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:20,277
When we were kids, he'd get into fights
with kids from other schools.

91
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,480
No one could take him.

92
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,224
My brother, he...

93
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:40,696
We used his prize money to start
this company.

94
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:46,342
One of your father's dreams was making
this company a success.

95
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:59,814
How old were you when you started
working here?

96
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,329
Fifteen.

97
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:09,598
So, you've been working here for
fifteen years now.

98
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,028
I know life hasn't been very fair to you.

99
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,850
After your father died...

100
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,227
I did everything I could to
take care of you.

101
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:33,976
With Nakamura retiring, there will be
an opening in management.

102
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,901
I'd like to promote you.

103
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,424
Oh, I see.

104
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,731
Too good for the dirt under your nails?

105
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:50,218
You want to wear a suit to work?

106
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,174
You got something else you want to do?

107
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,692
Let me be clear.

108
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,404
There isn't a job out there for a middle
school dropout.

109
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,308
No one will want you.

110
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,801
This isn't a bad offer.

111
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,153
So take it.

112
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,329
Or you can quit.

113
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,391
I don't care either way.

114
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,890
Let me know your decision
by next week.

115
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,704
Today is payday.

116
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,982
I expect rent by tomorrow.

117
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:30,630
Drop the cash deposits off at the bank
when you get your money.

118
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,565
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

119
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,753
He didn't offer you the promotion, did he?

120
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,085
Tell me he didn't give you
Nakamura's job.

121
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:47,857
So what if he did?

122
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:50,733
You don't have any experience in management
like I do.

123
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,211
You don't have a college degree.

124
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,657
You don't need the money.

125
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:54,487
How do you know?

126
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,158
Your parents are gone so you don't have to
take care of them.

127
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,704
You don't have any kids.
You're on your own.

128
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,144
I need money.

129
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,415
Why?

130
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,842
You don't have any hobbies.
You don't go out.

131
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,606
You don't do anything.

132
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,443
What do you need it for?

133
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,029
None of your business.

134
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,338
Oh, I see what's happening here.

135
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:20,339
You're going to propose to Kumi.

136
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,352
No.

137
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,842
That's my little sister.

138
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,967
You were saving up to propose,
weren't you?

139
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,899
It's been three years.
It's about time.

140
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,565
I'm not proposing.

141
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:33,812
Hey!

142
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,135
What's wrong with my sister?

143
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:37,703
Hey!

144
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:43,313
Look, a foreigner!

145
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,910
Say hello.

146
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,001
Say hello to him.

147
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:49,477
Say hello!

148
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,054
He said hello to you.

149
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,146
Good afternoon!

150
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:59,015
We actually have classes for
young children.

151
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:01,524
Classes start from ages one and up.

152
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:04,226
We can begin as early as next week.

153
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,452
I see.

154
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,727
Thank you so much.

155
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,502
Say bye-bye!

156
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,107
Say thank you, bye-bye!

157
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,056
Say bye-bye!

158
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,744
Thank you!
Bye!

159
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,706
Thank you so much!

160
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:22,002
Ok, let's call it a day. I'm pretty beat.

161
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,938
Yeah, I am pretty tired of the animal
in a petting zoo treatment as well.

162
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:30,193
I've always thought of you more like a
circus animal. A tiger or something.

163
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:31,471
I think you mean circus freak.

164
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,107
You're not a freak.

165
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,884
For a lot of these people, you're the
first foreigner they've ever met.

166
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:38,931
And probably will be the last.
You're special.

167
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,273
Yeah, I get it.

168
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,264
I get it, it's just that sometimes
I forget I'm a foreigner.

169
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,659
Like, for a moment I don't understand why
everyone is staring at me all the time.

170
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,967
And then we have days like today where
I am extremely hyper aware of it.

171
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:58,828
Well, I think there's a big difference
between curious glances and hostile glares.

172
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,682
Curiousness is marketable.

173
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:02,512
I know, I'm counting on it.

174
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,561
So am I.

175
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,697
Hey, it's payday today. Make sure and see
if the right amount was transferred or not.

176
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,522
You'd think after five years they would
get it right.

177
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:14,783
You'd think after ten they would, but you'd
be surprised how often they get it wrong.

178
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,330
- See you tomorrow morning.
- Bye bye.

179
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,326
Please wait a moment.

180
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,774
Your account balance is 250,130 yen.

181
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,763
Withdrawing 200,000 yen.

182
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:40,685
Please wait a moment.

183
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,837
Thank you very much.

184
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,542
Put this in Nobu's usual account.

185
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,254
Please wait a moment.

186
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,591
Your account balance is 5,690,980 yen.

187
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,623
Here you are.

188
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:47,371
Hey, Kumi.

189
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,837
About what I said earlier.

190
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:51,947
How is this evening?

191
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,244
Hi! Hello.

192
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,408
There you are!

193
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,094
Ask him already!

194
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,660
Are. You. Hungry?

195
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:11,225
Oh, no thank you. I'm sorry, I don't
really have any money.

196
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,371
It hurts so much!

197
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,490
I'll pay for it if you speak English
to Marie while we eat.

198
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,900
I would love to go.
Yes.

199
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,361
She needs all the help she can get.

200
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:26,377
Yes, she does.

201
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Let's go!

202
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:34,331
Thanks for waiting!

203
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:36,690
Thank you!

204
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:40,964
Here is your chilled noodles and
the onigiri for you.

205
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:43,456
Thank you so much.

206
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:48,348
And hamburger!
Delicious!

207
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,853
We heard you.

208
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,179
I need a fork!

209
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:00,314
He doesn't know how to use chopsticks!

210
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,771
One fork!
So good.

211
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,833
Lucas, how is Marie doing at school?

212
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:16,220
Is she getting better?

213
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,815
Yeah, she's doing alright.

214
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,242
Did you hear Marie?

215
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:25,617
He said your English is getting better!

216
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:32,917
You know, Marie is only a bit younger
than you.

217
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,780
Isn't she like ten years younger than me?

218
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,811
Exactly.
Just a bit.

219
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,494
She is single.
You are single.

220
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:47,716
Ok. You know, I don't think
I'm really her type.

221
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:54,453
Marie, what are you doing?

222
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,025
We're in public!

223
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,671
I saw a video that said this kind of
stretch was good for your jawline.

224
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,063
So what?

225
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,467
You don't need to do them right now.

226
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:04,492
Yoshiko?

227
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,767
Shiori?

228
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,259
Is that really you?

229
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:13,217
I can't believe it, it's been forever!

230
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:39,462
Hello.
How are you?

231
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:43,071
How about dinner sometime?

232
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,363
What a surprise!

233
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,308
I haven't seen her in forever!

234
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,832
You finished already?

235
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,715
Yes, and I really have to get going.

236
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,965
I have so much to do for work tomorrow.

237
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,764
I'm going to go. Thank you for
the invitation.

238
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,091
- See you later.
- Bye bye.

239
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:10,150
Marie! Say goodbye!

240
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,925
Good. Bye. Lucas.

241
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:58,712
Are you there?
Dinner is my treat!

242
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,698
How about tonight?

243
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:04,680
But of course,
Mon Cherie

244
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:19,078
So, you're not French?

245
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,091
No, I'm American.

246
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,233
I thought your profile said you were
French.

247
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,780
No, it says American.

248
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,724
Well, you look very French.

249
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:39,287
Really? I'm Irish and Italian.

250
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,510
Do you speak French?

251
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,739
No, sorry, I don't speak any French.

252
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,625
What if you tried to speak French?

253
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,528
Can you understand this?

254
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,577
Like I said, I don't speak any French.

255
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,133
Oh, no.

256
00:19:56,158 --> 00:20:00,010
I brought my French textbook so that
we could look at it together.

257
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,744
Oh, did you think I was a French
tutor or something?

258
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,025
No, I just thought it would be fun
to look at together.

259
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:13,393
You thought it would be fun to look at
a textbook on a date?

260
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:17,345
I thought we could take turns reading it.

261
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,333
French is the language of love
after all.

262
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,750
Ok, I still do not speak French so...

263
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,373
It's been awhile.
How are you?

264
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:34,977
Busy.

265
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:38,089
I heard from Ryosuke.

266
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,539
He said you've been picking up shifts.

267
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,908
I heard your uncle might promote you.

268
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,228
Ryosuke tells you everything.

269
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,429
My brother has a big mouth.

270
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,121
I'm still thinking.

271
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:58,695
Thank you.

272
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:04,232
You'll make a lot more money
as a manager.

273
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:08,407
You could settle down, start a family...

274
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,483
I could afford this restaurant.

275
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:18,345
It's a special place for a special day.

276
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,315
What's so special about it?

277
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,402
You tell me.

278
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,696
You know, there's a really famous Japanese
bath house near here.

279
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,708
Have you been to an onsen before?

280
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:54,029
I thought maybe we could get to know
each other a bit better over there.

281
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:57,170
Sorry, I have tattoos.

282
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:59,458
They don't allow people with tattoos
into onsen.

283
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:00,878
I've never been.

284
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:04,012
Really? You have tattoos?

285
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,987
That's so surprising.

286
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:08,576
I didn't think French people
liked tattoos.

287
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,478
I'm going to the bathroom.

288
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,321
I'll be back shortly, my love.

289
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,765
Something funny?

290
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:39,618
I wonder what living in another
country feels like.

291
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,511
To be surrounded by things you don't know.

292
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:47,824
Things you've never seen before.

293
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,799
It must be scary.

294
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:59,149
A little lonely too.

295
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,665
Do you ever think about leaving here?

296
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:04,824
What do you mean?

297
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:05,924
This town.

298
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:11,207
No, I'm happy here.

299
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,377
Sorry, did I miss something?

300
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:21,301
Ryosuke said that you might...

301
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,233
He said you might propose tonight.

302
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,124
Can I ask you a question?

303
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:39,271
I want to get married.

304
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:42,717
I want to become a mom.

305
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:48,151
You're not interested in any
of that, are you?

306
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,890
No.

307
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,669
I didn't think so.

308
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,373
I didn't think so for awhile now.

309
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:09,054
Do you know what happens to women like
me if we stay in relationships like this?

310
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,332
One day, men like you figure out
what it is you really want.

311
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:22,584
Women like me wind up alone.

312
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:31,178
I don't want to wind up alone.

313
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,442
I have the right to have a happy life.

314
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,038
So do you, Ken.

315
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,618
It's not too late.

316
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,188
For either of us.

317
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:51,741
We can't stay like this.

318
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,761
Neither one of us will be happy.

319
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Ken.

320
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:05,588
I hope you figure out what it is you
really want.

321
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:08,744
I really do.

322
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:37,169
Alright, shall we get going?

323
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,169
I could give you a ride home.

324
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:44,228
No, I'm fine. I like taking the train
at night by myself.

325
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,299
Well, we should do this again sometime.

326
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,461
I will be in touch.

327
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,772
Good bye!

328
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,317
Hey! Good morning.

329
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,808
Did you get my package?

330
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,051
Yeah, I did. It is right here.

331
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:32,347
Did you open it yet?

332
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:33,912
No, I was waiting for you.

333
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,398
Well, I have my morning coffee ready
to go.

334
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,924
Let's see what customs took out
of your box this time.

335
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:46,173
Mom! American underwear!

336
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,298
Japanese underwear either fits in the front

337
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:54,823
or the back, but it does not fit into the
front and the back at the same time-

338
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:59,260
Oh, Mom. There are bikinis.

339
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:01,870
Did you not want bikinis?

340
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:05,938
Seriously? You took all of this in and
were like,

341
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:09,653
Yeah! My sun definitely wants to wear
bikinis.

342
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,841
I pretty much went to the men's underwear
section of Kohls.

343
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:17,893
Closed my eyes, and grabbed whatever
I could find.

344
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:23,680
I mean, do you know how pornographic
the men's underwear section is?

345
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:26,116
Look, I will make you a deal.

346
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:31,308
If you could promise me to keep your eyes
open long enough to find me boxer briefs,

347
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:35,613
I promise to not make you do this for
another six months.

348
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,269
Or however long American underwear
lasts for. Deal?

349
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,479
Deal. How was your night?

350
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,033
Date.

351
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,216
How did that work out?

352
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:49,716
Poorly. He thought I was French
for some reason.

353
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:53,198
And at the end of the date he kissed
me on my nose.

354
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:00,859
Well, I'm glad you went out. I wish
you went out more.

355
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:02,115
I go out!

356
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:05,215
No, you don't. Not out out.

357
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,365
Ok, fine. You are right. I do not go
out out.

358
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,077
What is your point point?

359
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,544
It just seems like a waste.

360
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:18,920
You're all the way over there in Japan,
and you're not actually experiencing it.

361
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,466
I do.

362
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:23,919
I do.

363
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:25,567
In my own way.

364
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:31,290
We are just so close.

365
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:34,031
I wish I could lend you some more money.

366
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:38,392
I've just taken out as much from
my retirement as I can.

367
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:42,495
Hey! It's ok!

368
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,226
Because, as of today, which was payday

369
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:49,389
we are 800,000 yen away.

370
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,292
What is that in dollars?

371
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:55,417
Depending on the exchange rate...

372
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:56,758
Eight thousand dollars.

373
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:58,281
Wow!

374
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:02,034
Until then, what shall we bake?

375
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:07,742
So, I was thinking it is morning there.

376
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,174
It is very much broke o'clock over here.

377
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:15,145
How about you bake scones

378
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,788
and I will fantasize about your scones.

379
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,532
Yes, I love it.

380
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:39,593
How do you do?

381
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,068
My name is Ken.

382
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,990
I am Japanese.

383
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,964
I am thirty years old.

384
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,060
My hobby is boxing.

385
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,969

It's on the table.

401
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:09,562
There are some deliveries today.

402
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,772
Use my van.

403
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,181

Good. Morning!

410
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:53,739
Very good, Marie! You did it.

411
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:18,193
Almost there.

412
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:33,905
No!

413
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,425
No!

414
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,366
No!

415
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,989
Lucas, see me after class.
Urgent.

416
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
No.

417
00:35:57,347 --> 00:36:00,123
Let's practice a few sayings that
you can use

418
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:04,281
to ask someone what they want to do with
their lives.

419
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,043
Repeat after me and remember that
no one's English is perfect.

420
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:12,341
It's alright to make mistakes.

421
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:16,351
It's not alright to give up because
it's difficult.

422
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,674
What is your goal?

423
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,365
What is your goal?

424
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:23,641
What do you want to do with
your life?

425
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,778
What do you want to do with your life?

426
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:30,598
Seriously, Ken? What the hell is wrong
with you?

427
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,574
Hey!

428
00:36:33,145 --> 00:36:34,597
What do you want? I'm busy.

429
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:36,740
What happened with you and Kumi?

430
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:39,464
Nothing. She broke up with me.

431
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:41,966
Move.

432
00:36:41,974 --> 00:36:44,699
You wasted three years of my sister's
life.

433
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:47,349
You've got nothing to say for yourself?

434
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:50,452
Hey, what's your problem?

435
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,153
Quit messing around.

436
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,135
What was that for?
Would you stop?

437
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,725
Are you serious?

438
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,430
Hey, Ken!

439
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:03,465
And remember that no one's
English is perfect.

440
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:07,161
It's alright to make mistakes.

441
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:10,888
It's not alright to give up
because it's difficult.

442
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:14,095
What is your dream?

443
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,479
What is your dream?

444
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,134
What is your goal?

445
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,139
What is your goal?

446
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:23,370
Very good.

447
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:25,314
Everyone needs a dream.

448
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:30,014
I hope this lesson helped you think about
your own dreams as well.

449
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:43,996
Hey! I am so sorry about this morning.

450
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,807
I can't believe I'm about to say this
to you, but my bike got hit by a car.

451
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,509
Then I had to walk here.
It took forever.

452
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,925
Literally, it can never happen again.

453
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,871
Lucas, sit down.

454
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:59,088
Oh, shit.

455
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:00,765
Lucas, language.

456
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,300
Sorry, shoot, am I in actual trouble?

457
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,172
I don't think I've ever been late before.

458
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,554
I found out what was taking so long with
your contract.

459
00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:14,775
They've decided to close the school.

460
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,401
What? Why, I thought we were
doing alright!

461
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,982
They are going to close five other schools
in the area as well.

462
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,638
There's just not enough business to keep
us all open.

463
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,724
They'd rather push more students
into the schools

464
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,873
that are doing good than keep us open.

465
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,415
When?

466
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,826
Next month.

467
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,075
Uhh...

468
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,373
Should I be worried?

469
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:41,657
Am I going to be alright?

470
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,509
No, there's still a lot of schools open.

471
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:46,783
They're going to find one that needs
another teacher.

472
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:49,132
Once they do, they'll make a new
contract for you.

473
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:51,997
They know about your visa expiring
in two weeks.

474
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,707
Did they say when they're going to get
back to you about the school?

475
00:38:55,837 --> 00:39:00,249
Tomorrow. I know it's your day off, but
would you mind stopping by around noon?

476
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Yeah.

477
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:06,208
Sure. Thank you.

478
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:10,779
Well, see you tomorrow.

479
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:19,072
Erika? Are you alright?

480
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,472
Yeah. I'm not sure how to tell everyone
that they are out of a job.

481
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:29,638
But at least you are the only one I
really need to worry about.

482
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:35,930
We have all these people coming in to sign
up because of the fliers we handed out.

483
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,724
And I have to tell them something too.

484
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,295
Yeah.

485
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:44,136
We really handed out a lot of fliers,
didn't we?

486
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:46,955
We really did.

487
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,080
What do you mean you're closing?

488
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,775
I'm really sorry.

489
00:40:27,814 --> 00:40:30,225
We just got the news today.

490
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,506
There's nothing we can do about it.

491
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:36,626
But I've been saving up for this.
I have the money.

492
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:40,697
I can refer you to the nearest school and-

493
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:41,722
Where is it?

494
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,521
- Kasamashi.
- Kasamashi?

495
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:47,061
That's two hours away from here.
I can't go to school there.

496
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,687
I'm really sorry. I could try to
find a local tutor and-

497
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,436
Never mind. I'll figure it out myself.

498
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,119
Hey.

499
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,493
Do you need help?

500
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,226
I don't think I can fix this on my own.

501
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:34,496
Do you have any tools in your van?

502
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,479
You speak Japanese?

503
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,831
Hang on, I'll get my tool box.

504
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,415
What happened?

505
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:09,553
I parked too close to the street.

506
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:11,193
It got hit by a car.

507
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,501
That's terrible.

508
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:16,565
Do you think we can fix this?

509
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:22,516
Maybe if we have the right tools.

510
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:25,937
We could probably fix the frame.

511
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,444
The spokes are ruined though.

512
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,503
You should just buy a new one.

513
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:39,735
I hate to ask, but would you mind giving
me a ride home?

514
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:40,777
Alright.

515
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:42,886
It's not far by car.

516
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,640
If I walk it will take over an hour.

517
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:48,642
I have to do something with this bike, too.

518
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:51,493
It's no problem.

519
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:53,713
But we are pretty dirty.

520
00:42:53,817 --> 00:42:56,920
My uncle just had the delivery
van detailed.

521
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:00,728
I know.

522
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,451
There's a public bath just up the way.

523
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:06,276
Let's head there and get cleaned up first.

524
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:08,275
What's wrong.

525
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:12,435
I have a tattoo. They won't let me in.

526
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,466
We'll see about that.

527
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:17,206
Let's go.

528
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:35,489
Alright. Let's go.

529
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:42,788
What did you do?

530
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:46,047
They couldn't afford my uncle's
normal rates.

531
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:49,646
So I did the work for them
on the side.

532
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:53,340
We've got an hour.

533
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,665
What's wrong?

534
00:43:59,488 --> 00:44:02,051
I've never been to a public bath.

535
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:04,676
I don't know what to do.

536
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:07,437
It's your first time?
Alright.

537
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:08,953
I'll show you.

538
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,236
Take your clothes off here.

539
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:28,109
You can use a locker if you want.

540
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,705
No one else is here though.

541
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,046
You can just leave your things anywhere
you'd like.

542
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:36,668
Isn't there a robe or something?

543
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:39,288
A robe? What for?

544
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:43,554
Don't we wear something until we get
in the water?

545
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:49,303
That's what the towel is for.

546
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:52,182
I'll be waiting inside.

547
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:31,820
Before you get in, you need to shower.

548
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:33,969
Wash your hair too.

549
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:39,741
Everyone uses the same water, so we need to
make sure we are clean.

550
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:43,823
Come over here.

551
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:53,522
You're alright, it's just us in here.

552
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:54,547
Don't worry.

553
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:08,539
There's a special bath outside.
Let's try it out.

554
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:37,428
What's your name?

555
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:47,687
My friends and family back in America
all call me Luke.

556
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:54,395
After I got here, everyone said it was
easier for Japanese people to say Lucas.

557
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,267
Since then, everyone calls me Lucas.

558
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:00,392
Which do you like more?

559
00:47:03,262 --> 00:47:05,065
Then I'll call you Luke.

560
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,627
What's your name?

561
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,353
Ken.

562
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:14,856
What?

563
00:47:15,518 --> 00:47:16,845
Just Ken?

564
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,903
My name is Kentaro.

565
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:26,277
But my full name is Kennith Johnson.

566
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,303
So, your mom is foreign or something?

567
00:47:32,328 --> 00:47:33,574
She's American.

568
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,311
Do you go to America a lot to
see your mom?

569
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:42,124
I've never met her.

570
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,035
By the way, why do you want
to study English?

571
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,862
I'm trying to find my mom.

572
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:55,980
I've been looking for a few years now.

573
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:58,771
I have a lot of questions for her.

574
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,490
I can't ask them if I don't speak English.

575
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:07,003
What kind of questions?

576
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:12,078
For example, does cancer run in our family?

577
00:48:13,177 --> 00:48:15,127
What about gum disease?

578
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,983
Does she know what happened to me?

579
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,677
Does she have any idea?

580
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:26,175
What happened to you?

581
00:48:29,397 --> 00:48:33,156
I was raised by my uncle.

582
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:38,020
I dropped out of school after
middle school.

583
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:42,532
I had to help my uncle out at his company.

584
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:49,732
I've spent my whole life not knowing who
I was or where I belonged.

585
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,049
I still don't know.

586
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:04,981
Are you hungry?

587
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:09,687
Let's get some food.

588
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,383
I would love to go.

589
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,884
I have to be careful how I use
my money.

590
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:21,056
What are you saving for?

591
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:23,929
You really want to know?

592
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,030
Yes.

593
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:27,552
For this.

594
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:29,406
This old cafe?

595
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,291
Yes.

596
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:31,316
What do you mean?

597
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,319
I want to buy it.

598
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:35,669
Why?

599
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:36,941
Why?

600
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,943
After I buy it, I'll open my own cafe.

601
00:49:42,164 --> 00:49:46,274
I've been thinking about what I want to do.

602
00:49:50,317 --> 00:49:52,978
Wait a minute, what are you doing?

603
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,170
Let's go inside.

604
00:50:08,374 --> 00:50:11,359
Oh my God, this is amazing!

605
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,086
You've never been inside?

606
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:15,668
No, I've only seen it from the outside.

607
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,684
It's just like before the old owners
passed away.

608
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:30,498
It even smells the same.

609
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:32,747
You've been here before?

610
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:36,701
When I was a kid with my uncle.

611
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,146
There's wood rot here.

612
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,019
There's water damage too.

613
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:50,409
It's going to take a lot of money to bring
this place up to code.

614
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,208
But look at this.

615
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:54,269
See?

616
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:59,151
If I bought each of these things separately
it would cost a fortune.

617
00:50:59,913 --> 00:51:02,929
But they're selling this cafe as is.

618
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,661
That means I won't have to buy any of it.

619
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:06,884
It's perfect.

620
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:09,403
I have to show my mom.

621
00:51:10,031 --> 00:51:11,190
Are you serious?

622
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:13,628
Yeah.

623
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:20,189
I want to do group English lessons over
there every day.

624
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:24,294
The cafe staff will only speak in English.

625
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:26,226
Really basic English.

626
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:31,300
Customers will learn English bit by bit.

627
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,947
You can practice like you were at
a cafe in America.

628
00:51:36,675 --> 00:51:37,748
Sounds good.

629
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,306
But how?

630
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:42,508
Ok.

631
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:44,641
Come here.

632
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:53,962
Customers will come to the counter as
soon as they enter.

633
00:51:54,622 --> 00:51:56,622
We will greet them like this.

634
00:51:57,885 --> 00:51:59,220
What can I get for you?

635
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,015
What does that mean?

636
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,810
It is asking them what they would like
to order.

637
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:07,058
Yes!

638
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,351
The customer will say something like this.

639
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:11,626
Could I have a cafe latte please?

640
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:14,031
Of course. One moment please.

641
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:17,703
How do you make a cafe latte?

642
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:21,784
Two shots of espresso and steamed milk.

643
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:26,781
How do I tell them to wait?

644
00:52:26,806 --> 00:52:27,806
Coming right up.

645
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,766
Coming right up.

646
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:34,875
Ok!

647
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,465
Here you go! Thanks for waiting.

648
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:39,802
Have a nice day.

649
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:41,441
Yes! Good!

650
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:43,048
Let me try!

651
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,294
What can I get for you?

652
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:48,201
Can I have two black coffees please?

653
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:49,226
Two black coffees.

654
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:53,992
That will be...400 yen?

655
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:55,149
400 yen?

656
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,028
What?

657
00:52:56,052 --> 00:52:57,733
That's way too cheap.

658
00:52:58,684 --> 00:53:00,364
This menu is really old.

659
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:02,517
Two black coffees.

660
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,799
Two black coffees. Thanks for waiting.

661
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,140
This might sound stupid.

662
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:26,156
Have you ever been to a place that felt
like it was yours?

663
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:32,326
Like you were supposed to be there?

664
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:36,551
Like it was just waiting for you to arrive?

665
00:53:37,742 --> 00:53:43,303
There's a connection there even though
there shouldn't be but-

666
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:44,878
there just is?

667
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:56,657
I felt it the first time I saw this cafe.

668
00:53:57,544 --> 00:54:00,698
The connection was there.

669
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:05,810
Since that day, I've been saving.

670
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:11,117
I've been saving all the money I have.

671
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,419
How much more do you need?

672
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:17,444
About 800,000 yen.

673
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,269
Even if I get the money, I need to find
a guarantor because I'm a foreigner.

674
00:54:30,362 --> 00:54:31,613
Sorry.

675
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:35,513
It's stupid.

676
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:36,791
It's not stupid.

677
00:54:39,763 --> 00:54:41,250
Let's go eat.

678
00:54:41,275 --> 00:54:42,743
My treat.

679
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:45,289
Yeah.

680
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:53,638
That's how you eat that?

681
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:56,334
Yeah, it tastes really good with wasabi.

682
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,286
What's wrong?

683
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,492
You don't like Japanese food?

684
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:07,561
It's not that.

685
00:55:08,665 --> 00:55:12,125
My landlord brings me here all the time.

686
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:19,237
This is the only thing they have
that reheats well.

687
00:55:19,922 --> 00:55:23,445
Whenever I come here I eat half here.

688
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,070
I take the rest home.

689
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,351
When I get hungry, I eat the rest.

690
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:30,840
I get it. That's really smart.

691
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:32,359
It's nothing special.

692
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,201
Thanks for waiting.

693
00:55:34,647 --> 00:55:36,035
Hamburger ok?

694
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:38,319
So delicious.

695
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,376
What was that?

696
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,661
He can't use chopsticks so we always
bring him that fork.

697
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:47,384
He comes in here a lot.

698
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:49,373
You know he can't use chopsticks.

699
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:52,774
Why are you making him use a giant fork?

700
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:54,690
Why don't you buy him a regular one?

701
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:57,194
He doesn't mind. It's funny.

702
00:55:57,898 --> 00:55:59,525
It's funny that he can't use chopsticks?

703
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:03,696
I'm sorry, what's happening?

704
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,047
You know what?

705
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,292
Put that tray down.
Bring chopsticks.

706
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:10,744
Alright.

707
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:13,718
Ken, it's alright.

708
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,757
Use these chopsticks.

709
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:26,072
Instead of making him use a giant fork,
teach him how to use these.

710
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:30,203
He doesn't speak Japanese.
How can I teach him?

711
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:31,822
Yes, I do.

712
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:32,925
If only he did.

713
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,950
Wait, what?

714
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,957
Wait a minute!

715
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:39,132
Why didn't you say something before?

716
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:41,528
I have tried many times.

717
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:45,179
You always shout back at me in English.

718
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:46,497
I just gave up.

719
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:48,091
I see.

720
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:50,429
Alright.

721
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:52,932
Ready?

722
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:55,953
First, hold it like this.

723
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:58,386
That's right.

724
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:00,172
Good.

725
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:01,457
Very good.

726
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:05,394
Then you hold the second one
like this.

727
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,757
I put it in here?

728
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:10,447
Yes!

729
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:12,584
Now try.

730
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,145
Hang on.

731
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:26,964
Good!

732
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:32,014
Holy shit.

733
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:33,653
I did it!

734
00:57:33,693 --> 00:57:35,659
See? That wasn't hard.

735
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:37,662
That's right!

736
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:39,169
You did a great job!

737
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:40,558
I'm not talking to him.

738
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:41,632
I'm talking to you.

739
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:42,694
Me?

740
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:46,777
Then I should clap for myself?

741
00:57:50,495 --> 00:57:51,495
Let's go.

742
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,923
Thank you, thank you!

743
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
It was good!

744
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:08,480
- Where are we going now?
- You'll see.

745
00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:09,870
Hey, Ken!

746
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:11,555
What is wrong with you?

747
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,834
You could have killed me earlier!

748
00:58:14,564 --> 00:58:16,389
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

749
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:18,121
You said you were saving money.

750
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:19,905
I thought you were going to propose
to Kumi.

751
00:58:20,056 --> 00:58:21,651
Then you break up.

752
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:24,030
I could have died at work today!

753
00:58:24,055 --> 00:58:26,688
Hi! Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

754
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:30,774
My name is Lucas. I'm with
First Class English Language Schools.

755
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,126
We're here doing a new student campaign.

756
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:35,658
Ken here has just signed up for classes.

757
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:38,918
Did you want to sign up for English
language classes as well?

758
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,716
What did he say?
What's this?

759
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:44,732
It's an English language school.
That's what I'm saving up for.

760
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:48,632
This is what you've been saving up for?

761
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:53,557
What do you need English lessons for?

762
00:58:53,702 --> 00:58:57,168
You never even finished high school,
how will you learn English?

763
00:58:57,275 --> 00:59:00,525
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt this...

764
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:02,154
I think you're confused

765
00:59:02,178 --> 00:59:06,416
Just because you go to school that
doesn't necessarily make you smart.

766
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:08,723
I think you're proof of that.

767
00:59:11,044 --> 00:59:12,388
What did he say?

768
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:15,478
You know what, Ken? I think we
need to get going.

769
00:59:15,503 --> 00:59:18,387
We should go to the school and
fill out that paper work.

770
00:59:18,844 --> 00:59:20,668
Very important.

771
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:23,450
You understand what I mean, right?

772
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,541
Sorry. Got to go.

773
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:29,640
Wait, what did he say?

774
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,807
You went to an expensive school.

775
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:35,529
You have parents who paid for you to go.

776
00:59:35,553 --> 00:59:37,767
With all that, you still
don't understand.

777
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:41,839
Bye!

778
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:44,569
Hey! Wait!

779
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:03,853
Here?

780
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:04,893
Yes.

781
01:00:11,988 --> 01:00:12,988
Isn't it nice?

782
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:14,669
It's so beautiful.

783
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:21,812
I come here at night when
I want to think.

784
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:25,676
This way.

785
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,689
What do you usually come here to
think about?

786
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:45,721
I don't know.

787
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,744
My mom. My dad.

788
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:54,342
Your mom and dad.

789
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,100
You never said what happened.

790
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:10,480
My mom came here when she
was twenty-one years old.

791
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:14,086
She worked at the language school
you work at now.

792
01:01:16,991 --> 01:01:19,173
She was a free spirit.

793
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:23,514
She usually wore her hair down and
was always smiling and laughing.

794
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:28,642
She was so happy and free.

795
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:32,860
My dad fell in love the moment he
saw her.

796
01:01:34,508 --> 01:01:36,704
He was a boxer.

797
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:40,236
He got whatever he set his mind to.

798
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:44,890
Every match. Every competition.

799
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:51,757
Of course, he was determined to
win her heart too.

800
01:01:54,512 --> 01:01:57,235
In the end, he did.
They got married.

801
01:01:58,563 --> 01:02:01,959
One year later, I was born.

802
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:06,800
One month after that...

803
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:10,899
...she left and never came back.

804
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:16,035
My father tried, but he couldn't find her.

805
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:22,016
Then, after a while...

806
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,529
...he was gone too.

807
01:02:26,665 --> 01:02:32,609
It was my father's first and only loss.

808
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:35,720
What do you mean?

809
01:02:37,815 --> 01:02:41,140
He couldn't take it so he killed himself.

810
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:47,963
I had nowhere else to go.

811
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:51,940
My uncle wound up having to raise me.

812
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,560
I'm sorry.

813
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,178
I'm so sorry.

814
01:03:02,576 --> 01:03:03,961
What's that?

815
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:10,221
It's my mom!

816
01:03:10,824 --> 01:03:14,132
She always calls me this time of night.

817
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:15,687
What should I do?

818
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:17,402
Answer it.

819
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:23,241
Hello?

820
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,361
I saw the pictures. The place
looks amazing.

821
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,765
How did you finally get in?

822
01:03:29,502 --> 01:03:31,373
Wait, where are you?

823
01:03:31,496 --> 01:03:34,302
I can't really talk right now.

824
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:36,551
Because I'm out.

825
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,670
Out?

826
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:39,812
Out out?

827
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,667
Out out out?

828
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:44,426
You know, maybe I should explain it...

829
01:03:45,858 --> 01:03:47,000
Can you hang on a second?

830
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:53,212
Do you want to say hello?

831
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,644
In English?

832
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,867
Alright.

833
01:04:02,552 --> 01:04:03,552
Hello?

834
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:04,696
Hello!

835
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:08,752
Nice to meet you. My name is Ken.

836
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:12,054
Nice to meet you. My name is Cathy.

837
01:04:12,735 --> 01:04:14,326
Lucas, are you still there?

838
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:16,885
Oh yes.

839
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:20,425
I'm really hoping you're out out out.

840
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,521
Yeah, me too.

841
01:04:25,045 --> 01:04:26,096
Me too.

842
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:28,044
Let me know which one it is tomorrow.

843
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,718
Have a good night boys.

844
01:04:29,775 --> 01:04:31,711
Thanks mom. Love you.
Bye.

845
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:37,004
Is it raining?

846
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:41,545
Do you play video games?

847
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:47,168
I could kick your butt at any
retro fighting game.

848
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,290
I have some.

849
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:51,228
- You do!
- Yes!

850
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:53,533
- Seriously?
- Let's go!

851
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,998
There's no way you can beat me.

852
01:05:03,058 --> 01:05:06,450
That's strange.

853
01:05:07,082 --> 01:05:08,082
Who's that?

854
01:05:08,107 --> 01:05:11,406
It's probably my landlord's daughter.

855
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:14,990
Maybe she had a question about
her homework.

856
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:16,609
I see.

857
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:18,854
It's really late.

858
01:05:20,537 --> 01:05:22,093
I should get going.

859
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,000
No, it's fine!

860
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:27,971
I don't know what she wants,
but it will only take a minute.

861
01:05:28,254 --> 01:05:31,516
Today was a lot of fun.
Let's hang out again.

862
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:34,983
Are you really leaving?

863
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,621
Yeah. See you soon.

864
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:06,178
What are you doing here?

865
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:07,869
Are you ok?

866
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:12,251
There you are. I've been waiting.

867
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:16,388
We need to talk.

868
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,990
Ok.

869
01:06:19,788 --> 01:06:21,029
This is bad.

870
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:24,184
This is really bad.

871
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:26,105
We have a special connection.

872
01:06:26,604 --> 01:06:29,271
I'm sure you feel it too.

873
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,643
I think it's time we were honest
with each other.

874
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:35,089
Marie...

875
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:38,152
Clearly you have been drinking.

876
01:06:39,184 --> 01:06:41,501
You need to go home.

877
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:43,842
Now.

878
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:48,767
Marie, what are you doing?

879
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:50,557
Listen to me.

880
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,780
I am gay.

881
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,398
Do you hear me?

882
01:06:55,963 --> 01:06:59,970
Duh. I mean, it takes one to know one.

883
01:07:00,113 --> 01:07:01,930
You should have picked up on me sooner.

884
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:10,703
I'm sorry, did you just speak in English?

885
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,084
Oh, come on.

886
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:16,084
I have a business degree from UCLA.
Of course I speak English.

887
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:19,677
Also, lesbian. So, relax.

888
01:07:22,258 --> 01:07:23,257
Holy shit.

889
01:07:23,282 --> 01:07:24,870
Holy shit indeed.

890
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:31,161
I'm really confused.

891
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:35,641
I thought you couldn't speak English.

892
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:39,256
You couldn't get a job, and then you came
back her to live with your mom.

893
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:43,147
No, that's just some bull shit that I made
up so that my mom would let me

894
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:46,085
take care of her while she was recovering
from her surgery.

895
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,017
Well, now she's recovered.

896
01:07:49,156 --> 01:07:51,124
I don't have a way back to America.

897
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:55,361
And I've got those California girls on my
mind if you know what I mean.

898
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:57,561
No.

899
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:01,694
I have no idea what you mean.
Seriously, what is happening?

900
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,978
I have a proposal for you.

901
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:06,613
A literal one.

902
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,090
What's this?

903
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:12,255
A solution to both of our problems.

904
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:17,184
It's a wedding ring.

905
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:18,423
Yup.

906
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:22,221
Sorry, I don't follow.

907
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,341
Are you asking me to marry you?

908
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:26,198
No!

909
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:30,630
I'm asking you to ask me to marry you
in front of my mom.

910
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:35,266
We get married, I get my mom off my back.

911
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,779
I can live my best lesbian life on the
other side of the planet.

912
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,068
You get a spousal visa in japan.

913
01:08:42,108 --> 01:08:45,830
In three years time, you can apply for
permanent residency.

914
01:08:46,526 --> 01:08:49,717
As icing on the cake, I'll cosign whatever
paperwork you need

915
01:08:49,741 --> 01:08:51,651
to get that building you're obsessed with.

916
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:55,399
Two birds with one wedding ring
shaped like stone.

917
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:56,989
What do you say?

918
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,724
I say...

919
01:09:05,438 --> 01:09:08,303
that everything I thought I knew about you
was a lie.

920
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:11,928
and I think you're talking about a couple
of different felonies.

921
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:16,150
They're only felonies if we get caught.

922
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,849
And we won't get caught.

923
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:20,502
And how do you know that?

924
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:25,609
When you submit your paperwork for a
spousal visa on either side of the ocean,

925
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:28,554
you submit pictures proving
the relationship.

926
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,691
We have tons of those thanks to my mom.

927
01:09:32,076 --> 01:09:33,798
Marrying the daughter of your landlord

928
01:09:33,822 --> 01:09:36,584
after secretly being in love with
her for years?

929
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:42,323
It's the perfect story, and the only part
that a lie is being in love.

930
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:44,589
Everything else is true.

931
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:49,066
Well.

932
01:09:50,114 --> 01:09:52,249
That's a hell of a presentation.

933
01:09:52,662 --> 01:09:54,487
Business degree from UCLA.

934
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,335
I do my research.

935
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:01,626
Ok, I need to get back upstairs before
my mom comes back.

936
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,725
I'm going to leave this with you.

937
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,748
Think it over.

938
01:10:08,849 --> 01:10:10,083
You do know me.

939
01:10:10,262 --> 01:10:12,263
This is just a bit of new information.

940
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:13,724
And I know you.

941
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:16,512
We really could pull this off.

942
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,413
Have a good night.

943
01:10:50,404 --> 01:10:51,747
Are you alright?

944
01:10:53,452 --> 01:10:55,132
What's going on?

945
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:03,392
What happened?

946
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:05,774
Are you ok?

947
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:51,963
What?

948
01:11:52,245 --> 01:11:53,925
I don't know what to do.

949
01:11:58,183 --> 01:11:59,441

What's this?

969
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:06,742
Breakfast!

970
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:11,557
I don't have a lot of food.

971
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:15,188
My mom just sent a box from America.

972
01:14:16,614 --> 01:14:18,560
I used some of that.

973
01:14:21,782 --> 01:14:23,047
You sleep alright?

974
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:24,457
I guess.

975
01:14:26,615 --> 01:14:28,079
Here, try this!

976
01:14:31,637 --> 01:14:33,307
It's good!

977
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,520
That's all?

978
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:44,319
I use about twice as much.

979
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:46,516
See?

980
01:14:50,088 --> 01:14:51,088
It's really sweet.

981
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:53,868
What kind of food do you like?

982
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,955
I'll cook for you next time.

983
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,877
I can make anything, but
I love to bake.

984
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,319
Next time?

985
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:04,114
Yeah, next time!

986
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:07,519
I mean, we never got to play games.

987
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,328
Right?

988
01:15:18,816 --> 01:15:20,486
Sorry, did I miss something?

989
01:15:20,768 --> 01:15:22,291
No.

990
01:15:26,808 --> 01:15:31,315
We're not kids.

991
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:37,050
I think we both know the difference
between something and nothing.

992
01:15:41,615 --> 01:15:47,461
Yesterday felt like a lot more than
nothing to me.

993
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,041
It did, didn't it?

994
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:59,470
Listen.

995
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:04,352
I'm not asking you to say anything special.

996
01:16:04,953 --> 01:16:06,415
But, please.

997
01:16:07,304 --> 01:16:11,725
Tell me I'm not the only one who
felt something special yesterday.

998
01:16:13,005 --> 01:16:14,026
I have to go.

999
01:16:15,664 --> 01:16:16,776
What?

1000
01:16:17,548 --> 01:16:18,548
Ken!

1001
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,110
Lucas, who was that?

1002
01:16:58,412 --> 01:16:59,912
What happened to your bike?

1003
01:17:02,949 --> 01:17:06,030
Marie, can you drive me to the
school, please?

1004
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,461
Yeah, of course.

1005
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,214
I'll go get dressed.

1006
01:17:32,693 --> 01:17:35,137
What happened to you yesterday?

1007
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:40,091
You can't just come and go
as you please.

1008
01:17:45,647 --> 01:17:47,976
This is a job, Ken.

1009
01:17:51,724 --> 01:17:52,805
Don't be late.

1010
01:18:13,973 --> 01:18:18,060
Hey! Sorry I am late, I had to
get a ride.

1011
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:19,149
Lucas.

1012
01:18:19,315 --> 01:18:22,528
Yeah, just give me one second and
I'll be ready to go.

1013
01:18:22,612 --> 01:18:23,916
Lucas.

1014
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:31,737
Oh.

1015
01:18:32,831 --> 01:18:34,157
Yeah.

1016
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:50,665
This email just came in from
the head office.

1017
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,292
They declined your transfer.

1018
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,944
What does that mean?

1019
01:19:03,102 --> 01:19:05,927
They're not just closing schools
in our area.

1020
01:19:06,523 --> 01:19:09,711
They're closing one fourth of the
schools in the country.

1021
01:19:10,361 --> 01:19:13,282
And they are making large staff cuts.

1022
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:15,615
I'm...

1023
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:20,512
I'm really sorry, but they are
letting you go.

1024
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:27,541
No.

1025
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:29,661
That cannot be right.

1026
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:33,731
No, we will call Shizuoka.
They're always looking for people.

1027
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:34,930
It's closing.

1028
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:36,700
Then, you know what, we'll call Nagano.

1029
01:19:36,724 --> 01:19:38,796
We know the owner, and he'll
give me a job.

1030
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:42,415
I'm sorry. It's closing too.

1031
01:19:46,717 --> 01:19:47,959
This can't be right.

1032
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:52,497
I only have two weeks left on
my visa.

1033
01:19:54,505 --> 01:19:58,911
There's not enough time to find another
job or pack up my stuff.

1034
01:20:02,982 --> 01:20:04,467
There's not enough time.

1035
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:08,123
I know.

1036
01:20:16,522 --> 01:20:18,164
Fuck them.

1037
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:21,641
Language.

1038
01:20:22,022 --> 01:20:24,164
But yeah, fuck them.

1039
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:26,816
What do you want to do?

1040
01:20:27,141 --> 01:20:29,483
I'll help you in any way that I can.

1041
01:20:34,403 --> 01:20:36,403
I want...

1042
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:41,746
to order a pizza.

1043
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:47,381
I'm so tired of being hungry
all the time.

1044
01:20:48,263 --> 01:20:49,810
Alright.

1045
01:20:49,835 --> 01:20:51,588
Let's order a pizza.

1046
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:54,818
And let's see what we can find.

1047
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:56,913
Maybe there's something.

1048
01:20:57,739 --> 01:20:58,802
Yeah.

1049
01:21:01,113 --> 01:21:02,580
Maybe there's something.

1050
01:21:10,103 --> 01:21:12,448
I finally figured it out.

1051
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:13,619
Not now.

1052
01:21:13,644 --> 01:21:16,697
I know why my sister broke up with you.

1053
01:21:17,809 --> 01:21:19,248
What are you talking about?

1054
01:21:19,273 --> 01:21:21,856
I figured it all out last night.

1055
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:26,051
You're hooking up with that
gay foreigner.

1056
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,666
Where did you go after that?

1057
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,695
Did you guys have sex in your
uncle's car?

1058
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:34,433
What's wrong?

1059
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:36,988
He wear you out?
Can't speak?

1060
01:21:37,504 --> 01:21:40,297
Last warning.
Walk away.

1061
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:44,773
I'm so sick of you and your bullshit.

1062
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:47,240
Everyone is just putting up with you.

1063
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:51,924
They do it because this is your
uncle's company.

1064
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:53,099
Even your uncle.

1065
01:21:53,457 --> 01:21:56,949
He just puts up with you because
your dad killed himself.

1066
01:21:56,974 --> 01:22:02,138
He feels bad for you because you had
to quit school.

1067
01:22:02,406 --> 01:22:04,772
You want to know the truth?

1068
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:08,009
Everyone thinks you're just a stupid
dog who can't-

1069
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:17,820
Ken, stop!

1070
01:22:26,704 --> 01:22:29,555
That's enough.
It's over.

1071
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:41,593
See what I mean?
Just a stupid dog.

1072
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:45,608
Get him on a leash.

1073
01:22:45,737 --> 01:22:47,064
Let's go.

1074
01:22:57,585 --> 01:22:59,110
Sit down!

1075
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,017
What?

1076
01:23:10,696 --> 01:23:12,964
Are you going to hit me again?

1077
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:15,786
Then what?

1078
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:19,302
Go to jail when someone calls the police?

1079
01:23:20,424 --> 01:23:23,160
That's what will happen if you hit me
like you hit Ryosuke.

1080
01:23:23,263 --> 01:23:25,088
Someone will call them.

1081
01:23:25,896 --> 01:23:26,896
I'm serious.

1082
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:31,985
Then you'll really have a fight
you can't win.

1083
01:23:32,695 --> 01:23:34,231
I don't care.

1084
01:23:38,999 --> 01:23:40,047
Yeah.

1085
01:23:42,662 --> 01:23:44,475
I'm getting that.

1086
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:21,905
You show up when you want
to show up.

1087
01:24:22,928 --> 01:24:25,587
You leave when you want to leave.

1088
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,943
Ryosuke has a college degree.

1089
01:24:30,183 --> 01:24:33,056
He's way more qualified for the promotion.

1090
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:36,136
And yet...

1091
01:24:37,103 --> 01:24:40,837
You do whatever you want and you
get promoted?

1092
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:44,439
How do you think that looks to everyone?

1093
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:46,162
Then give him the promotion.

1094
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:49,051
I don't want it.

1095
01:24:51,342 --> 01:24:52,342
Fine.

1096
01:24:54,447 --> 01:24:55,963
Then what do you want?

1097
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,615
I don't know.

1098
01:24:58,225 --> 01:25:01,547
I never had a chance to figure that out.

1099
01:25:01,572 --> 01:25:04,926
You ungrateful bastard!

1100
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:10,620
Your father sacrificed everything to
open this business.

1101
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:14,040
This business keeps food on our table
and pays for our home.

1102
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:16,907
Your father-

1103
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:21,605
I'm not my father.

1104
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,967
I don't want his life.

1105
01:25:24,523 --> 01:25:25,523
I see..

1106
01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:28,825
No, you are not your father.

1107
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:31,397
You've sure got his face and his eyes.

1108
01:25:31,685 --> 01:25:36,288
But you've got no appreciation for the
things he left you to build a life with.

1109
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,296
I don't want them.

1110
01:25:39,349 --> 01:25:40,942
I don't want his pictures.

1111
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:42,307
His room.

1112
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,328
His boxing gloves.
His job.

1113
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:46,605
I don't want any of it.

1114
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,226
I want something of my own.

1115
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:51,974
Don't you see?

1116
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:56,038
I have the right to a happy life too.

1117
01:25:56,055 --> 01:25:57,673
One that's mine.

1118
01:25:58,392 --> 01:26:00,185
Not his.

1119
01:26:22,947 --> 01:26:25,531
I know you don't remember your father.

1120
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:32,096
But he was tough as hell.

1121
01:26:36,122 --> 01:26:39,111
Right up until your mother left.

1122
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:44,297
After that...

1123
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:48,502
...there was no getting him back.

1124
01:26:50,257 --> 01:26:54,139
The misery got to him and it
wouldn't let go.

1125
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:04,754
I don't want it to get to you too.

1126
01:27:06,781 --> 01:27:11,421
I want you to be happy.
Whatever it takes.

1127
01:27:52,498 --> 01:27:55,841
Not even a word of thanks for
all the trouble he caused us.

1128
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:02,691
So, what do you want to do?

1129
01:28:04,378 --> 01:28:05,986
I want to go to school.

1130
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:10,846
Cut my hours down to part time.

1131
01:28:11,892 --> 01:28:14,425
I want to figure myself out a bit.

1132
01:28:15,219 --> 01:28:17,723
I think that would be good for all of us.

1133
01:28:22,442 --> 01:28:23,447
What's this?

1134
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:27,727
It's a work order to tear down that
old cafe.

1135
01:28:27,752 --> 01:28:30,275
They want to turn it into a parking lot
if no one buys it.

1136
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:32,015
When?

1137
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,488
The end of the month.

1138
01:28:44,774 --> 01:28:46,594
So, this is it?

1139
01:28:46,782 --> 01:28:48,383
I'm sorry, Lucas.

1140
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:52,427
There's just not a lot of English schools
around here to begin with.

1141
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,467
What happens if I can't find a job?

1142
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:58,998
What do you mean?

1143
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:03,358
What happens when my visa runs out?

1144
01:29:05,372 --> 01:29:07,157
Do they send someone to get me?

1145
01:29:07,286 --> 01:29:08,727
No.

1146
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,329
They just expect you to leave.

1147
01:29:13,675 --> 01:29:16,870
So, they trust me enough to leave
but not enough to stay?

1148
01:29:17,747 --> 01:29:20,080
Well, that is a great system.

1149
01:29:21,009 --> 01:29:24,520
I can call immigration on Monday
and explain the situation.

1150
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:28,914
They'll probably give you a temporary
extension on your visa for thirty days.

1151
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:31,518
Thirty days.

1152
01:29:32,074 --> 01:29:38,187
I would have thirty days to say goodbye and
pack up five years of my life into boxes?

1153
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,884
That sounds horrible.

1154
01:29:41,575 --> 01:29:43,940
Lucas, you can't think like that.

1155
01:29:44,074 --> 01:29:47,462
You sound like you've already given up.

1156
01:29:49,369 --> 01:29:50,369
Luke!

1157
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:53,111
Luke, I need to speak with you.

1158
01:29:53,465 --> 01:29:56,155
What's he doing here?

1159
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,957
Luke, wait.

1160
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:06,546
Luke!

1161
01:30:09,735 --> 01:30:10,735
Luke!

1162
01:30:12,988 --> 01:30:14,527
Please wait!

1163
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:20,161
Luke.
Luke!

1164
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:25,643
Do you have any idea how hard it is to
live in another country?

1165
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:29,791
To have to relearn to do the
simplest things.

1166
01:30:30,076 --> 01:30:34,368
And to feel small and stupid every day
as a result.

1167
01:30:36,117 --> 01:30:40,846
You are constantly lonely

1168
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:43,437
even though you are surrounded by
people staring at you.

1169
01:30:44,152 --> 01:30:49,263
And the pressure of feeling helpless
all the time is crushing.

1170
01:30:50,087 --> 01:30:53,722
On the best of days you feel
barely tolerated.

1171
01:30:53,755 --> 01:30:58,278
And on the worst of days you feel
completely and totally alone.

1172
01:30:59,484 --> 01:31:01,892
But you keep trying and trying

1173
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:05,786
because you believe you are where
you are supposed to be.

1174
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:07,747
There's this connection.

1175
01:31:08,017 --> 01:31:10,826
And you think if you try hard enough

1176
01:31:10,851 --> 01:31:16,183
that this place that drives you crazy...

1177
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:19,871
and that you love so much...

1178
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:23,890
Someday...

1179
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,793
That someday it's going to love you back.

1180
01:31:41,026 --> 01:31:44,075
So, why didn't it love me back?

1181
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:56,201
Luke, they're going to tear down
the cafe.

1182
01:31:57,859 --> 01:32:01,463
I saw the work order for the demolition
at my job.

1183
01:32:02,322 --> 01:32:05,152
If you don't buy it by the end
of the month...

1184
01:32:06,037 --> 01:32:08,281
...they're going to turn it
into a parking lot.

1185
01:32:09,258 --> 01:32:12,757
Of course. Of course they are.

1186
01:32:16,914 --> 01:32:19,708
Luke, please wait.
I have money.

1187
01:32:20,169 --> 01:32:23,174
I have the money I was going to use
to go to school.

1188
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:25,230
I can help you.

1189
01:32:25,626 --> 01:32:28,050
We can fix it up together.

1190
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,856
I want to go to America.
You teach me English.

1191
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:38,488
We could look for my mom.
Together.

1192
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,279
Hey.

1193
01:34:14,225 --> 01:34:15,311
You're up early.

1194
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,733
Late actually.

1195
01:34:16,758 --> 01:34:19,761
You'll never believe what happened
at the bakery.

1196
01:34:21,602 --> 01:34:23,442
Where are you?

1197
01:34:25,984 --> 01:34:29,095
I am sitting in the middle of the road.

1198
01:34:29,354 --> 01:34:30,559
Why?

1199
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:37,856
Because this is the spot where my feet
decided to stop working.

1200
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:45,891
Sorry, that came out really
melodramatic, didn't it?

1201
01:34:46,367 --> 01:34:50,414
Ok, can you be melodramatic on the
side of the road?

1202
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:54,359
Hang on.

1203
01:35:06,637 --> 01:35:07,814
Better?

1204
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:09,152
Much.

1205
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:10,886
What's wrong?

1206
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:15,919
I found out they're closing
the school today.

1207
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:21,889
They also decided to not renew my contract.

1208
01:35:22,502 --> 01:35:27,969
The cafe that we've been
saving to buy...

1209
01:35:29,113 --> 01:35:32,265
It's going to be torn down at the end
of the month.

1210
01:35:33,017 --> 01:35:38,990
Even if I had a visa, we never would have
gotten the money together in time

1211
01:35:39,015 --> 01:35:42,288
to buy it, so that means no matter
how you look at it...

1212
01:35:43,559 --> 01:35:48,011
All of the saving and eating out of the
trash I have been doing...

1213
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:49,943
It was for nothing.

1214
01:35:50,448 --> 01:35:54,186
Ok, now I'm starting to get the melodrama.

1215
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,479
To top that off...

1216
01:35:57,504 --> 01:36:02,819
Last night was easily the happiest I've
been in a very long time.

1217
01:36:04,322 --> 01:36:07,281
And this morning...I don't know.

1218
01:36:07,456 --> 01:36:10,266
Ken just kind of freaked out and
he ran out of the house.

1219
01:36:10,291 --> 01:36:13,924
And when he came to the school to apologize

1220
01:36:13,949 --> 01:36:15,949
and try to help...

1221
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:22,726
I didn't know what to do, so I just
pushed him away.

1222
01:36:22,796 --> 01:36:25,376
So that he didn't get dragged into
all of this.

1223
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:27,909
Mom?

1224
01:36:27,934 --> 01:36:31,077
Hang on, now I need to lie down.

1225
01:36:31,325 --> 01:36:32,325
Ahh.

1226
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:35,917
So you see why my feet suddenly
stopped working, huh?

1227
01:36:36,823 --> 01:36:38,823
Yes. It's a lot.

1228
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,466
Are you alright?

1229
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:44,235
You know, I...

1230
01:36:45,744 --> 01:36:46,972
thought I was.

1231
01:36:48,506 --> 01:36:53,116
Until yesterday when I was with
Ken and I...

1232
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:57,597
I thought things were about to
get better.

1233
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:03,005
And then today.
It's just...

1234
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:06,199
further confirmation.

1235
01:37:07,127 --> 01:37:11,254
No. I'm not alright.

1236
01:37:15,785 --> 01:37:17,785
How much time is left on your visa?

1237
01:37:20,366 --> 01:37:22,366
2 weeks.

1238
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:24,072
That's fourteen days.

1239
01:37:24,429 --> 01:37:25,772
Yeah, I know.

1240
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:28,842
It's not enough time.

1241
01:37:30,232 --> 01:37:31,606
It's...

1242
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,144
336 hours.

1243
01:37:38,668 --> 01:37:40,668
336?

1244
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:45,358
Alright.

1245
01:37:49,867 --> 01:37:54,335
336, mom that is a big old number!

1246
01:37:54,563 --> 01:37:55,563
Yes, it is.

1247
01:37:55,934 --> 01:37:58,598
Mom, did you just save the day with math?

1248
01:37:59,218 --> 01:38:02,043
Because if you did, that was some
solid momming.

1249
01:38:02,894 --> 01:38:05,476
I'm not done momming yet.

1250
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:09,844
Listen, if you have the ability to eat
out of a trash can

1251
01:38:10,188 --> 01:38:16,133
Then you have the ability to do whatever
it takes to fix this visa situation.

1252
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:18,749
You've got 336 hours.

1253
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:22,186
It's enough time to take
a deep breath.

1254
01:38:22,782 --> 01:38:26,039
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1255
01:38:26,063 --> 01:38:28,145
And start thinking about all the
friends and

1256
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:31,878
connections you've made in the
past five years.

1257
01:38:32,213 --> 01:38:36,327
Recognizing that things are
not alright was the hard part.

1258
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:41,750
Now the question is what are
you going to do to make things better?

1259
01:38:46,934 --> 01:38:47,934
Marie?

1260
01:38:49,182 --> 01:38:51,182
Will you marry me?

1261
01:38:52,785 --> 01:38:54,142
Of course, yes!

1262
01:38:54,327 --> 01:38:57,834
A thousand times, yes!

1263
01:39:00,452 --> 01:39:01,491
Fuck.

1264
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,614
What?

1265
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,012
My mom is washing the dishes.
She didn't hear you.

1266
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,714
Hurry, come inside. Let's
do it again.

1267
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:07,833
Ok.

1268
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:15,492
Ok, now.

1269
01:39:16,563 --> 01:39:17,762
Do it now.

1270
01:39:17,938 --> 01:39:19,220
Will you marry me?

1271
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,683
Of course, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

1272
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,730
Oh, I'm so happy!

1273
01:39:29,825 --> 01:39:31,167
Seriously?

1274
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:33,197
Mom?

1275
01:39:34,717 --> 01:39:35,717
What is it?

1276
01:39:35,785 --> 01:39:36,785
Hurry!

1277
01:39:36,817 --> 01:39:39,285
I'm trying to finish the dishes.

1278
01:39:42,372 --> 01:39:43,826
Do it now.

1279
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:46,647
Wait, what's happening?

1280
01:39:46,672 --> 01:39:48,586
Seriously?

1281
01:39:48,888 --> 01:39:50,169
Will you marry me?

1282
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:54,319
Of course, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

1283
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:57,461
Yes?

1284
01:39:58,487 --> 01:39:59,812
Yes yes?

1285
01:39:59,837 --> 01:40:02,321
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

1286
01:40:03,272 --> 01:40:06,050
It finally happened.

1287
01:40:06,379 --> 01:40:08,780
I've been waiting for this day!

1288
01:40:08,805 --> 01:40:13,140
Now you can finally go back to America
and get on with your life.

1289
01:40:14,235 --> 01:40:15,426
Wait, what?

1290
01:40:16,224 --> 01:40:18,410
You came back after my surgery.

1291
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:22,615
I told you to stay in America, but you
wouldn't listen.

1292
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:25,451
I told you I didn't need any help.

1293
01:40:25,547 --> 01:40:30,073
The next thing I knew, you forgot how to
speak English and were on a plane.

1294
01:40:30,776 --> 01:40:33,692
So you knew the whole time?

1295
01:40:34,297 --> 01:40:36,983
Your mother is not stupid.

1296
01:40:37,563 --> 01:40:40,436
Then why didn't you say anything?

1297
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:43,684
You didn't seem to want to talk
about it.

1298
01:40:43,709 --> 01:40:46,300
So I wasn't about to ask you.

1299
01:40:46,325 --> 01:40:51,359
Once you get married, you're free
to go back to America.

1300
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:53,861
You can find a good girlfriend.

1301
01:40:54,185 --> 01:40:56,624
Lucas can get his cafe.

1302
01:40:57,324 --> 01:40:59,415
He can get a boyfriend too.

1303
01:40:59,822 --> 01:41:01,461
Wait a minute.

1304
01:41:01,564 --> 01:41:05,810
You knew I was gay all this time?

1305
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,369
You knew about me too?

1306
01:41:09,058 --> 01:41:11,174
How stupid do the two of you
think I am?

1307
01:41:11,393 --> 01:41:13,443
We don't have time for this now.

1308
01:41:13,468 --> 01:41:16,760
If you're proposing, that means we don't
have much time left.

1309
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:21,644
Alright, what's the plan?

1310
01:41:26,682 --> 01:41:28,682
I need to borrow the car.

1311
01:42:22,233 --> 01:42:23,257
Are you alright?

1312
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:24,867
Yeah.

1313
01:42:26,964 --> 01:42:29,193
I did something bad.

1314
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:31,932
There's this guy.

1315
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:36,052
I hurt him.

1316
01:42:37,844 --> 01:42:40,043
I didn't mean to.

1317
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,879
I just...

1318
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:48,396
I'm not very good at saying how I feel.

1319
01:42:51,278 --> 01:42:52,833
Yeah.

1320
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,972
I know.

1321
01:42:56,035 --> 01:42:58,094
My jaw still hurts.

1322
01:43:02,589 --> 01:43:07,136
I tried to apologize to him.

1323
01:43:08,303 --> 01:43:09,715
It was just too late.

1324
01:43:11,759 --> 01:43:13,663
This guy...

1325
01:43:14,235 --> 01:43:17,671
He's important to you?

1326
01:43:18,012 --> 01:43:19,012
Yeah.

1327
01:43:26,163 --> 01:43:30,000
It's hard being vulnerable.

1328
01:43:30,025 --> 01:43:32,037
I understand that.

1329
01:43:33,003 --> 01:43:36,852
But when it comes to someone important...

1330
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:40,892
...being vulnerable sometimes pays off.

1331
01:43:41,739 --> 01:43:44,303
I don't think it's going to this time.

1332
01:43:46,173 --> 01:43:48,053
I'm not so sure about that.

1333
01:43:49,912 --> 01:43:53,150
There's a foreigner standing out
in the driveway.

1334
01:44:07,517 --> 01:44:09,088
I am so sorry.

1335
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:13,175
I'm very sorry.

1336
01:44:18,408 --> 01:44:19,447
Hey.

1337
01:44:19,909 --> 01:44:21,004
Hey.

1338
01:44:22,075 --> 01:44:25,614
I am so sorry about earlier.

1339
01:44:27,638 --> 01:44:31,627
Just kind of seemed like everything
that could go wrong did go wrong today.

1340
01:44:34,473 --> 01:44:36,270
The truth is...

1341
01:44:36,365 --> 01:44:41,633
...things haven't been good for a while.

1342
01:44:42,757 --> 01:44:46,836
But things started to get better
after I met you.

1343
01:44:48,678 --> 01:44:50,453
I think for both of us.

1344
01:44:51,821 --> 01:44:52,821
So...

1345
01:44:54,241 --> 01:44:59,010
I want to keep getting better.
With you.

1346
01:45:02,428 --> 01:45:03,428
Let's get better.

1347
01:45:05,277 --> 01:45:06,277
Together.

1348
01:45:08,653 --> 01:45:10,043
What do you say?

1349
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:53,930
Let's get better.

1350
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:55,261
Together.

1351
01:45:56,676 --> 01:45:58,417
Together.

1352
01:46:00,303 --> 01:46:01,718
Come on, let's go.

1353
01:46:06,504 --> 01:46:08,996
Wait, how did you get here?

1354
01:46:09,751 --> 01:46:12,241
I drove Yoshiko's car.

1355
01:46:12,902 --> 01:46:14,569
Do you have a license?

1356
01:46:16,029 --> 01:46:17,029
In America.

1357
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:19,602
You broke the law to see me?

1358
01:46:19,703 --> 01:46:20,703
Oh, Ken.

1359
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:22,947
You have no idea.

1360
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:28,644
I'll drive.

1361
01:46:28,669 --> 01:46:31,165
Yes, please.
Yes.

No, no, no.

1369
01:47:03,969 --> 01:47:05,516
Good morning.

1370
01:47:06,123 --> 01:47:07,123
No.

1371
01:47:11,339 --> 01:47:12,394
Wake up.

1372
01:47:13,762 --> 01:47:14,910
Wait a minute.

1373
01:47:14,989 --> 01:47:16,192
Get up.

1374
01:47:16,871 --> 01:47:18,660
Just a few more minutes.

1375
01:47:19,665 --> 01:47:22,967
I said wait!

1376
01:47:24,078 --> 01:47:27,117
I'm awake! I'm up!

1377
01:47:28,549 --> 01:47:30,236
- Alright, that's better.
- Yeah?

1378
01:47:33,011 --> 01:47:35,126
- So, now let's go here.
- Uh huh.

1379
01:47:35,151 --> 01:47:38,010
And then I'll go here with my back.

1380
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,033
Languages are constantly evolving.

1381
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:50,632
- Nice!
- I finally got that part!

1382
01:47:51,335 --> 01:47:52,538
Which means...

1383
01:47:53,316 --> 01:47:57,175
♪ No one else like you in this world ♪

1384
01:47:58,215 --> 01:48:00,707
Luke, it's time to go!

1385
01:48:00,846 --> 01:48:01,846
Coming!

1386
01:48:04,990 --> 01:48:09,808
I brought over as much as I could
from the old school as far as materials go.

1387
01:48:09,967 --> 01:48:10,704
Nice.

1388
01:48:10,729 --> 01:48:12,823
And I hung up the fliers for
the new school.

1389
01:48:12,848 --> 01:48:15,006
I really think this is going to work.

1390
01:48:15,324 --> 01:48:18,355
You give them homework,
they come here to do it.

1391
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,397
Man, that sounds perfect to me.

1392
01:48:22,611 --> 01:48:23,638
Hey, Erika?

1393
01:48:23,694 --> 01:48:24,694
Yeah?

1394
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:26,265
Thanks.

1395
01:48:26,622 --> 01:48:27,622
For what?

1396
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:30,290
For not letting me give up.

1397
01:48:31,145 --> 01:48:32,145
Of course.

1398
01:48:33,129 --> 01:48:35,105
- Now, what about-
- Lucas!

1399
01:48:35,304 --> 01:48:37,001
She's here.

1400
01:48:37,145 --> 01:48:38,707
Your mom is here.

1401
01:48:39,945 --> 01:48:40,945
Come on!

1402
01:48:43,397 --> 01:48:46,287
When you get to California, I've already
got everything ready for you.

1403
01:48:46,691 --> 01:48:49,700
I can't thank you enough for helping me
get situated.

1404
01:48:49,824 --> 01:48:52,695
Of course! I can't thank you
enough for helping Lucas.

1405
01:48:53,268 --> 01:48:54,888
Well, both of you.

1406
01:48:55,756 --> 01:48:58,176
What is she saying?

1407
01:48:58,773 --> 01:49:02,931
I paid for all of those years of
English lessons.

1408
01:49:05,573 --> 01:49:07,423
I'm so nervous.

1409
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:10,182
Tell her that I love her earrrings.

1410
01:49:10,207 --> 01:49:12,150
My mom said she loves your earrings.

1411
01:49:12,298 --> 01:49:14,353
I love yours too!

1412
01:49:15,383 --> 01:49:17,684
She said she loves my earrings too?

1413
01:49:17,709 --> 01:49:19,050
That's what she said, right?

1414
01:49:19,436 --> 01:49:20,662
Do you like crafts?

1415
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:23,439
I could help you make a pair.

1416
01:49:24,835 --> 01:49:25,835
Mom!

1417
01:49:25,938 --> 01:49:28,616
Lucas! Oh!

1418
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:29,970
Hi!

1419
01:49:31,249 --> 01:49:34,643
Oh, this is amazing.

1420
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:36,098
I can't believe it's happening.

1421
01:49:36,123 --> 01:49:38,669
I can't believe you're here.
I'm so glad you made it.

1422
01:49:38,924 --> 01:49:40,137
Are you kidding?

1423
01:49:40,393 --> 01:49:41,949
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1424
01:49:43,631 --> 01:49:44,631
Where's Ken?

1425
01:49:45,035 --> 01:49:48,228
Oh, I think he's out back having
a cigarette. I'll go get him.

1426
01:49:48,382 --> 01:49:50,120
Ok, um...

1427
01:49:54,047 --> 01:49:55,856
I got the information you asked for.

1428
01:49:58,867 --> 01:50:00,015
Oh, wow.

1429
01:50:06,794 --> 01:50:07,794
Hey.

1430
01:50:15,479 --> 01:50:18,078
Is your mom alright?

1431
01:50:19,084 --> 01:50:21,437
She is the same as always.

1432
01:50:23,275 --> 01:50:25,020
She's waiting in the cafe.

1433
01:50:30,512 --> 01:50:32,114
This is for you.

1434
01:50:33,668 --> 01:50:35,596
A gift from my mom.

1435
01:50:39,296 --> 01:50:40,676
What's this?

1436
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,780
She did it.

1437
01:50:49,216 --> 01:50:51,628
My mom found your mom.

1438
01:50:56,112 --> 01:51:00,312
She...found my mom?

1439
01:51:00,819 --> 01:51:01,819
Yeah.

1440
01:51:03,613 --> 01:51:05,343
It's all in there.

1441
01:51:06,264 --> 01:51:08,695
Name. Address. Phone number.

1442
01:51:08,695 --> 01:51:10,695
She really did it.

1443
01:51:14,725 --> 01:51:15,725
Hey.

1444
01:51:19,058 --> 01:51:20,433
You ok?

1445
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:25,583
I'm alright.

1446
01:51:27,574 --> 01:51:28,574
Really?

1447
01:51:30,445 --> 01:51:31,847
Are you sure you're "daijoubu?"

1448
01:51:32,064 --> 01:51:34,476
- You sure you're "daijoubu?"
- Daijoubu.

1449
01:51:34,501 --> 01:51:36,332
Are you just a little "daijoubu,"
or like...

1450
01:51:36,445 --> 01:51:38,223
One hundred percent "daijoubu?"

1451
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:41,719
Thank you.

1452
01:51:43,992 --> 01:51:45,093
Thank you.

1453
01:52:04,902 --> 01:52:05,902
Hi.

1454
01:52:07,669 --> 01:52:10,992
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

1455
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,936
You're so handsome.

1456
01:52:14,032 --> 01:52:15,179
It's nice to meet you.

1457
01:52:18,492 --> 01:52:20,116
Come on, let's sit down.

1458
01:52:29,896 --> 01:52:32,625
Thank you for coming to Japan.
Umm...

1459
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,792
I heard so much about you from Luke.

1460
01:52:36,245 --> 01:52:39,809
And I've really been looking forward
to meeting you.

1461
01:52:41,085 --> 01:52:42,085
Umm...

1462
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:45,959
Luke told you about my mom?

1463
01:52:46,782 --> 01:52:49,196
He did. I'm really sorry.

1464
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:51,742
Thank you for finding her.

1465
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:54,699
Um...

1466
01:52:56,528 --> 01:53:01,255
It just makes me feel so much better to
know she's out there somewhere alive.

1467
01:53:02,282 --> 01:53:06,071
I studied English so I could speak
with my mom.

1468
01:53:07,346 --> 01:53:09,369
But I don't know her.

1469
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:12,652
Maybe it's for the best.

1470
01:53:16,559 --> 01:53:17,988
I know you.

1471
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:22,537
I think I'd rather speak English with you.

1472
01:53:24,793 --> 01:53:28,919
Well, you can speak English with me
anytime.

1473
01:53:30,802 --> 01:53:32,802
And me.

1474
01:53:33,912 --> 01:53:35,308
Thank you.

1475
01:53:37,063 --> 01:53:39,836
Oh, shit. I think I'm going to cry.

1476
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,074
- Ouch!
- You see?

1477
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:46,585
This is why you need to get a
girlfriend.

1478
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,921
I want to have that too.

1479
01:53:50,027 --> 01:53:53,420
Hurry up and find one
and settle down.

1480
01:53:53,788 --> 01:53:55,665
Wait a minute, get back here.

1481
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:59,274
She gets married and suddenly she
becomes a playgirl.

1482
01:53:59,377 --> 01:54:01,594
Coming home at all hours of the night.

1483
01:54:02,332 --> 01:54:06,762
Do you have any idea how hard it is
having a daughter like her?

1484
01:54:06,787 --> 01:54:08,078
Sorry about my mom.

1485
01:54:08,103 --> 01:54:09,703
What, it's true!

1486
01:54:09,876 --> 01:54:12,367
Everyone, it's almost noon!

1487
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,744
Is everyone ready?

1488
01:54:14,068 --> 01:54:17,268
Let's all gather around the counter
and take a picture.

1489
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,140
Let's go!

1490
01:54:19,171 --> 01:54:20,424
Hurry, hurry!

1491
01:54:24,042 --> 01:54:26,042
Stand together now!

1492
01:54:27,788 --> 01:54:29,148
Can I stand here?

1493
01:54:32,262 --> 01:54:33,841
Ten seconds!

1494
01:54:34,558 --> 01:54:37,187
- Where should I go?
- Here, stand next to me.

1495
01:54:37,266 --> 01:54:38,455
Thank you!

1496
01:54:41,603 --> 01:54:44,711
Alright, let's open!

1497
01:54:50,859 --> 01:54:52,311
Here we go.

1498
01:55:00,087 --> 01:55:01,250
Hi.

1499
01:55:01,654 --> 01:55:03,197
How can we help you?
