1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,240
and we are always thinking that

2
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,360
we will eat fixing.

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,880
Many people would like to eat bones,

4
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
but surely broken bones is not likely to be considered to be fatal for a human being.

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,240
The only belongs to the body.

6
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,000
C mor here is sort of a dead man's body.

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,680
If you throw them out,

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,960
the remains of our bodies could not be cleaned up.

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
That's why I have Congratulations Powerful Heroes book.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
Thank you.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,940
Look,

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't be afraid.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
General, don't waste your energy.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's my fault.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm the one who hurt you.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I must beg you.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
General, don't say that.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm your husband.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I should protect you first.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't drink the most expensive wine.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can drink it.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
General, don't cry.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can see Qian Yan now.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can die in Qian Yi's arms.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I must tell you in advance.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I love you.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
General.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
General.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
General.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
General.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
General.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
General, wake up.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
General.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm Cheng Qi.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
After the victory,

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we'll go back to the country and marry the new bride.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll work together.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I agree.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you, General.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm Cheng Qi.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm here to marry Shen Qian Ye, the daughter of Shen Manor.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please let me know.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Cheng Dai Zi.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How do you know?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Everyone calls me that in the military.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
After the victory, you must buy me a drink.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to drink the most expensive wine in the capital.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a deal.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a deal.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll drink it.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Cheng Qi.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Wake up, Cheng Qi.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This hairpin is hers.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've kept it with me for years.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll leave it to you.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Cheng Qi.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
After this,

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we'll take you home.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We'll drink the most expensive wine in the capital.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll drink it all.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I promise you.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I won't break my promise.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not the time to cry.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I must let her...

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Blood will be shed.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll be back.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's done.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is there nothing else you want to say?

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sorry.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You promised to keep that from me.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But you want me to die alone.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you really die, I'll kill you.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then I'll marry someone else.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,480
Is this your old sword?

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,040
Take it for身?

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes.

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Ever

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,040
Ever

80
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Ever

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,880
Ever

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Ever

83
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,760
Ever

84
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You can bet on it.

85
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
We can win.

86
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
I can't bet.

87
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
After all,

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Shen Tianye and Xihe are two people.

89
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
All along, you were just you.

90
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Not another person.

91
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
You don't even dare to think of me as someone else.

92
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Have you forgiven me?

93
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,760
You will pay for this with your whole life.

94
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
You're all useless!

95
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
You've already taken the Xuanlong Town.

96
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
How can you let them escape?

97
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

98
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,760
I never thought that Daji Si would be willing to kill me with his own body.

99
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Your Majesty, please spare me!

100
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Your Majesty, those rebels are wounded.

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
They can't escape.

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
As long as we order them to chase them with their troops,

103
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
we will find them.

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
You're right.

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Your Majesty, please spare me!

106
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I'll take them with me!

107
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
But all of this

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
has nothing to do with you useless people.

109
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
The time has come.

110
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Come on.

111
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Your Majesty,

112
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
this is a serious matter.

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
It concerns the state.

114
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

115
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm sure.

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Once the secret is revealed,

117
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
the consequences will be unimaginable.

118
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
I understand.

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,760
But I can't just watch that child's fate.

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
People in this world shouldn't continue to live in lies

121
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,040
and

122
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,760
to defend the world.

123
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
If I let them go,

124
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
how can I face my ancestors

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
after a hundred years?

126
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
I knew you would make such a choice.

127
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
No matter what,

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I will always be with you.

129
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Your Majesty, I've found out.

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Who?

131
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Tell me.

132
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
It's General Ximing.

133
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,760
What a loyal and loyal Xijia.

134
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
They never loved the ancient.

135
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Your Majesty, please calm down.

136
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
What do you think we should do now?

137
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
In this world,

138
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
only the dead are the most dangerous.

139
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
You should understand this.

140
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Since the Xijia love Pei Su so much,

142
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
let my good brother send them on their way.

143
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
So, in order to change the god's will,

144
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
my brother planted me on the fire.

145
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
But I was always in the dark.

146
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
It's said that

147
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
the goddess Changqing is the queen of the kingdom.

148
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
The one chosen by the goddess is the king of the heaven.

149
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,760
The one chosen by the goddess was you.

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
What a strange man!

151
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
He's a pervert.

152
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
He's planning something.

153
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,760
No wonder he's trying to set a trap

154
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
and force me to practice the forbidden arts.

155
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Father knows the secret.

156
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
So the Xijia was destroyed.

157
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
The people who were missing

158
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
will be connected to him.

159
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
We can't let the warehouse

160
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
fall into the hands of a liar like him.

161
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I want to take back

162
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
everything you took away from the Beidai.

163
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
I want to take back everything you took away from the Beidai.

164
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I want to take back everything you took away from the Beidai.

165
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Father, I'm willing to share your burden.

166
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Lang'er, you finally figured it out.

167
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
The father and son are connected.

168
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
The emperor and the minister are one.

169
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
They are one.

170
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Well said, Lang'er.

171
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,760
So tell me, how can I share your burden?

172
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Please take back the traitor with me.

173
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
The heart is like a coffin.

174
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
The old bond is broken.

175
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I only live once.

176
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I only want to see you.

177
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Your body was lost.

178
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Am I 이걸 m Joseph he

179
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,760
eight years ago

180
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
That now

181
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
one gets no evidence
