Master! No!

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Step aside.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,500
è·³?

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,640
Master?

14
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,800
Are you alright?

15
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,740
Did something happen?

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,620
I don't know.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,900
Would you like

18
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,860
Even if he hates me to the bone,

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,860
he still loves me.

20
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,860
This love is my first chance to survive.

Act III

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,540
S ottoman!

23
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
Go with me.

24
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,060
I'll kill you, you know that?

25
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I know.

26
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Then why are you here?

27
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Because last time you didn't kill me.

28
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Your sword was cut off once.

29
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I regret it once.

30
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Every time.

31
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
It's my last mercy to you.

32
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,060
It's my last mercy to you.

38
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Why are you here?

39
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Why don't you go to the battlefield?

40
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
I set up those ambushes.

42
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Because I also bet.

43
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
I bet you believe I love you.

44
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
I bet you will come to steal the wedding.

45
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
I bet you will fight with Pei Lang.

46
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,060
Then I will kill you at this time.

47
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
I want you to see the betrayal of Pei Lang.

48
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
You won.

49
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
But I won.

50
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm sorry.

51
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Don't move.

53
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Are you crazy?

54
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Don't think that Kuruji is useful.

55
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
I can give you my life anytime.

56
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
But if I die,

57
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,060
the murderer will destroy you.

58
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
I'm sorry.

60
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
There is no tomorrow.

61
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Who is to be next?

62
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Kuruji won't receive your love.

63
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Tell me the truth.

64
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
I did the magic not to peril me.

65
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
She has nothing to do with it.

66
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
You are the murderer.

67
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,060
What does I believe in?

68
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,060
Look where the musical mix starts.

69
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:46,920
Their

70
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:56,660
specially

71
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,360
tarantula

72
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Ext Foreign

73
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,480
I don't want to be your

74
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,040
confidante.

75
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,240
There's another purpose

76
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,320
under the goddess Changxin.

77
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
What is it?

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,920
It's a secret.

79
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,320
A secret?

80
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,440
It's so cold.

81
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Go get some rest.

82
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll tell you when you wake up.

83
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
Go get some rest.

84
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,600
Rest?

85
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
Is it a chance to run with you?

86
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,960
Shoot the smoke

87
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
it won't blow me out.

88
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
This kind of hairband

89
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,960
could loaf your Highness.

90
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,200
My love and feelings

91
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,960
are so sweet and lovely.

92
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,720
Just plea,

93
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,040
and I'll go, owner.

94
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Your Highness, Prince Yu's battle with Ning Yuanqi is a great injury.

95
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
You should take the medicine.

96
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
When did you come to teach me to make food?

97
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I dare not! I dare not! I dare not!

98
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I dare not!

99
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Keep the order.

100
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Search the traitor Pei Su.

101
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Remember, you can't hurt Shen Qianyin.

102
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
If you can't find her...

103
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I understand.

104
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I'll go right now.

105
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll go right now.

106
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,960
This time, I won't lose you again.

107
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
General Cheng, the secret report.

108
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
The Crown Prince is trying his best to capture Pei Su and Shen Qianyin.

109
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,960
As expected, the Crown Prince has taken action.

110
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Everyone, you must find them before the Crown Prince.

111
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Otherwise, it will be a big injury.

112
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Yes.

113
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Go.

114
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Go.

115
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Pei Su.

116
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Pei Su.

117
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Pei Su.

118
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Pei Su.

119
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
You lied to me again.

120
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
You lied to me again.

121
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
How could I believe you?

122
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
How could I believe you?

123
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Where did you go?

124
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Where did I go?

125
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
You scared me so much.

126
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I was afraid that I would hit you to death.

127
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Don't you like to eat pears?

128
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Eat the pear.

129
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,400
IA

130
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,080
