00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,860
crush i

2
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,160
you

3
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
you

4
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Episode 16

5
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,160
By the edict of the Emperor of Tiancheng,

6
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,160
the Queen is kind and kindhearted.

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,160
She is kind to the people.

8
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,160
She is the only one who is in the Hall of the Sun.

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Her name is Zhuang Ci.

10
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,160
The whole world is waiting for her.

11
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
The two of them are in the same boat.

12
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Your Highness,

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,160
you just got a cold-blooded heart attack not long ago.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Don't be too rough.

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Did you find out?

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
It's the Comet.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,160
He attacked the Queen in order to avenge her.

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
But the strange thing is,

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
he found the black mark left by the murderer.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
And the shape is very strange.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Can you tell whose tombstone it is?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
There is no clue at the moment.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I've never seen such a tombstone.

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Could it be Miss Qianye?

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Impossible. I saw it.

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Her tombstone is a sea-sweeping flower.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Sea-sweeping flower?

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,160
General Xi He is also a sea-sweeping flower?

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Could it be General Xi He?

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Do you remember the scene of the Xijia case?

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
There are also strange traces of the tombstone attack.

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
It should be a kind of forbidden tree.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Yes.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
This case has not been investigated yet.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
The palace is looking for the case of Jiyao.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,160
All the information and documents are in the Jiyao Office.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,160
But only the Emperor can check the documents of the Jiyao Office.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
I have my own way.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Let's see how long he can hide.

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Why are you still a little unhappy with the big revenge?

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Did you bury the tombstone?

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
He?

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
He is a criminal. How can he be allowed to bury the tombstone?

44
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Father knew that he was deceived and hated him.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
He had already thrown him into the mess.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,160
That night, he used a spell that I've never seen before.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,160
There is a mark on the body of Xi He Yin that is the same as the death of Xi Zha.

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Where did you go just now?

49
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
I can't control myself anymore.

50
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
It's okay.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
This is all the fault of the Queen.

52
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
If it is a big mistake, can it be corrected?

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,160
There are some mistakes that cannot be corrected and can not be repaid.

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I found some new evidence.

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
There are some special traces on the night when the Xi family was killed.

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I suspect that it was the Crown Prince.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Prince, what's wrong? You look so pale.

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Where was I last month?

59
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Did I go out and come back and still have blood all over my body?

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Prince, you will be sick every 15th of every month.

61
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Your body becomes weak and your mind is not clear, but you will not go out.

62
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
But I was really hurt.

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
The scar on my left arm was left that day.

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
That night was the night when the Xi family was killed.

65
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Prince, you are not...

66
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Yes, I suspect that I am the murderer of the Xi family's murder case.

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
How is that possible? Prince, you are a righteous person.

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I know you very well.

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Do you have a portrait of the body of the Xi family's murder?

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
It's in the

71
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Sister Qian Yan, it's me.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,160
I thought about it for a long time when I went back.

73
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Last time, I was not thinking well.

74
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
So tonight...

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
So tonight, I'm very well prepared.

76
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,160
The so-called army horses are not moving, the food is fresh.

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I didn't even prepare to be greedy.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
How can I take you to elope so hastily?

79
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Last time, you rejected me with heavy poison.

80
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
It's necessary.

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
I can't go with you.

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I know you have a lot of concerns.

83
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I don't like you at all.

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I know.

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Then why are you still...

86
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Don't worry, don't worry.

87
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I shouldn't go to the military camp.

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Sister Qian Yan, I don't blame you for being ungrateful.

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,160
I wrote a lot of letters to you.

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
When we are on the road, I can read it to you.

91
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Right?

92
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Isn't this the time I came?

93
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Prince, why don't you go out first?

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Sister Qian Yan...

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Are you going to elope?

96
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,160
He just came to me to end it.

97
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
What's the end of him and you?

98
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Do you have a past?

99
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Xi He

100
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
The crown prince misses General Xi He too much.

101
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm Qian Yan.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I know you are Xi He.

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Brother, you are avenging the Xi family, aren't you?

104
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Pei Su destroyed the whole family.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I have evidence.

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
The traces left by him when he killed Jian E Ying

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,160
are exactly the same as the Xi family when they were on the edge.

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll take you to see the evidence now.

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay, I want to see how you kill people.

110
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Where is the evidence?

111
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,780
Haven't you finished the

112
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,160
I'm sure it's here.

113
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Search again.

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Prince, the king is coming.

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,160
If you get caught, you can't shoot.

116
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Prince, the king is coming soon.

117
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Let's go.

118
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Let's go.

119
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I thought I wanted to talk to you.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I have something to tell you too.

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Pei Lang is really despicable.

122
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
He wanted to frame you for the Xi family's murder case.

123
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I want to see what he's going to do.

124
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I saw him go into the palace and found the evidence missing.

125
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Do you know who did it?

126
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Aren't you curious where the evidence went?

127
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I know who did it.

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I know who did it.

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
I know who did it.

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I know who did it.

131
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
I know who did it.

132
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I know who did it.

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Are you curious where the evidence went?

134
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I know who it is.

135
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I know where the evidence is.

136
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Anyway, he's going to kill you.

137
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
You have to be careful.

138
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
What do you want to tell me?

139
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
You be careful too.

140
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
I will.

141
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I'll go back first.

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I'll go back first.

143
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Your Highness.

144
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
What do you want to say?

145
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Xi He.

146
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
You are Xi He, right?

147
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Your Highness, you misunderstand.

148
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
How can I be

149
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
equal to General Xi He?

150
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Since ancient times,

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I have been a man and a soul.

152
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
The soul of the wood can never be the same.

153
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
You are Xi He.

155
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Your Highness.

156
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
If Xi He is alive,

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
he will be like me.

158
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
A useless man who can't even

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
wake up the soul of the wood.

160
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Besides, do you think

161
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
General Xi He will treat you like this?

162
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
He won't come back.

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
It's late.

164
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Your Highness should go back and rest.

165
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
I marry you.

166
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Be the Crown Princess Consort.

167
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Tomorrow is the day.

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Your Highness.

169
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

170
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I know you have a purpose to marry me.

171
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
You have always known

172
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
my purpose.

173
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I'm Xin Yue.

174
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
You really are not Xi He.

175
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
So Your Highness

176
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
is just because of me?

177
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm just a substitute.

178
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
No.

179
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
The Queen's funeral is not over yet.

180
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I'm afraid it's not suitable for the family.

181
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
The mother's wish

182
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
is to have me get married.

183
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Miss Shen.

184
