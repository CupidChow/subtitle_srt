1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know what?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I like the Crown Prince.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know you're afraid of offending the Crown Prince and the Prince.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's why you said that.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't like the Crown Prince.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I knew it, Qianye.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just like to be the Crown Princess.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're afraid of getting me involved?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid of getting you involved.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Listen,

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
over there,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
someone is watching us.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't move.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't go there.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm actually

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
already poisoned.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If I run away from here,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll be killed.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then you should rest.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll find the antidote for you.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll come back to save you.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Back then...

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, right.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You didn't receive the letter I wrote you.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I wrote a few more.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Remember to read it.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Prince,

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
we're here to catch Qian.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're just cooperating.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If we're not catching Qian,

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
can we leave?

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's been two hours.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My legs are numb.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why is she gone?

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Prince,

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
what are you looking at?

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's so cold outside.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why don't you come in and sit?

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll sit here.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why don't you come back with me?

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I need to heal myself.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll be back.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Prince,

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll leave.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You really make me

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
look bad.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What a good bird.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
First, you've solved the problem.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Second, you've found out

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Pei Lang's true feelings.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I didn't expect you to still

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
have a place in his heart.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Men like to steal.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why didn't I know

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you had a fiancee

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
who looked so much like you?

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Prince,

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
are you jealous?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're just cooperating.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not jealous.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's good.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't fall in love with me.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your Highness.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What did you find out?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness is wise.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Prince went to the Shen Mansion today.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not a coincidence.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He was competing with you

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
for Shen Qianye's colleague.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He's secretly sending people to investigate the queen.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's playing with me?

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
At the scene of the West Office,

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we found a black mark

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
on the body near the wound.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's like a unique trick.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He must be there that night.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But that doesn't prove

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
he's a accomplice.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you have any other evidence?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
When the West Office was confiscated,

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
all the items were taken to the storage room.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We need permission from the palace

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to check it.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I got it.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll find the evidence

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to make sure he's alive.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Prince,

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you can't control yourself

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
every night.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's related to the skeleton.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you find out who has a skeleton in the palace?

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The queen.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Prince,

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you've always been quiet.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't expect her to do this.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The queen and the king are like soldiers.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If we tell the king,

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
will he really let us go?

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Your Majesty.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Come, come, come, queen.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sit beside me.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come.

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Come.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Have you been well-groomed

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in the past two years?

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I...

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I shouldn't have made you work so hard.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not old enough.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm not good enough.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You should be more considerate.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Look at Lang.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Lang is the most obedient.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I've been thinking of choosing a concubine for him recently.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A concubine?

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where's Guaishun?

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your Majesty.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're so careless.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your Majesty,

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
it's all my fault.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's all my fault.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Not only you,

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but also Lang.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He killed Pei Su, the emperor of Tang.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He even stole a woman from Pei Su

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
for a witch.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
After all,

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's all because of your mother's family.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're low-born.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If I hadn't kept you in the palace for so many years,

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you would have...

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I...

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm always with you.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm always ready to share your worries.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Lang...

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lang is still young.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He doesn't know anything about men and women.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll take care of it.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll share your worries.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Your Highness.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Does it still hurt when the knees kneel?

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, it doesn't hurt.

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It doesn't hurt, Your Majesty.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's my fault.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I was careless.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's why I let that bitch Shen Qianye

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
fall into the crown prince's eyes.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're afraid that I'll kill you?

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sit.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sit.

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I know what you're thinking.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why don't you

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
just end it with Shen Qianye?

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fine.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You dare to use the sword to kill me.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I dare not.

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're low-born.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're a traitor.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm also thinking for the Crown Prince.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're thinking for your daughter, Shen Qianling, right, Jian Eying?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Shanqi wants to be a phoenix too.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She's really a noble woman.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You should persuade her.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The Crown Princess is a shameless woman.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She's not the one.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
As for Shen Qianye,

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have my own plans.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Your Highness, what are your plans?

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't ask me what you shouldn't.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm a low-born woman.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How noble I am.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How dare she humiliate me.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're heartless.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't blame me for being heartless.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Qianye.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Qianye.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Qianye.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Happy birthday.

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stay away from me.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you mean?

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm here to give you a gift, not to harm you.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm here to give you a gift, not to harm you.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're going to harm me.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's already on the table.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ying, check these jewelry.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I won't pretend.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But don't worry.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't dare to do these jewelry.

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
After all,

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the Queen asked you to enter the palace.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have to do everything to send you into the palace.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Do everything to send me in.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It doesn't mean I can do everything, right?

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It depends on your ability.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
After all,

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not the only one who wants you to die.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're the same.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The sea is full of flowers.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The yearning is over.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The soul is back.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The tender heart is missing.

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I miss you.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are the snow in the wind.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The wind blows flowers.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The wind burns my heart.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't care.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll start over.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,160
A 나

288
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,000
If you're here to attend the learnt.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Something

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Robin

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Fred

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,920
只此一生 只为一人相见
