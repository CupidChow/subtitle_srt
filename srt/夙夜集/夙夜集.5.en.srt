1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,380
Smashing

2
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:44,240
Star

3
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
Star

4
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,600
Star

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,220
голов из вашей семьи

6
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
It's useless.

8
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,220
If your flesh and blood were not useful,

9
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
you would have died.

10
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
I can't go on like this.

11
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Your Highness.

12
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Your Highness.

13
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Your Highness.

14
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,220
It's not easy for you to suffer with me.

15
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
I have a strong heart.

16
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
You have a lot of time.

17
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,220
So you must be feeling

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
that you have lost your heart.

19
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
I have a strong heart.

20
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Your Highness,

21
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
you will be able to endure

22
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,220
the pain of being forced to fight a hundred times.

23
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
It's worth it.

24
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,220
I just want Your Highness to help me awaken the soul.

25
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
If you don't agree,

26
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,220
then I can only let you go to the netherworld with me.

27
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Your Highness.

28
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
You're not poisoned.

29
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
You just want to fight me with a little bit of pain.

30
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
If you have a chance,

31
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
you can try the spring medicine.

32
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
It might be useful.

33
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Your Highness.

34
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Do you want to taste your own blood?

35
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
I'm too tolerant to you.

36
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Your Highness.

37
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
Miss Shen has been locked up in the dark room for a whole day and night.

38
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Do you want to give her some medicine?

39
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
She's strong.

40
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
She doesn't need it.

41
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Yes.

42
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Your Highness.

43
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
She doesn't dare to come.

44
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
It's my face.

45
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
He.

46
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Why did you wake up so late?

47
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Father.

48
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
Father.

49
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Father, is it really you?

50
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,220
It's me.

51
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
What's wrong?

52
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,220
Did you have a nightmare again?

53
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm sorry.

54
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
Did you have a nightmare again?

57
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,220
It's okay. Your father is here.

58
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
It's okay.

59
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Look.

60
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
The Crown Prince is here to see you.

61
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
He.

62
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
It's time to get up and put on the wedding dress.

63
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
It's okay.

64
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
It's okay.

65
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Why I was watching it?

66
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Why it happened?

67
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
You should say it.

68
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,220
You picked up the phone and sent an email.

69
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Andbridges, what are you doing?

70
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
What?

71
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Aren't we too touching?

72
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,220
It's like you're feeling스

73
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
What are you doing in there?

74
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
So hahaha.

75
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,780
You regret marrying me, don't you?

76
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
You can't do that.

77
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
What's wrong, A'Hou?

78
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Nothing.

79
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,780
I seem to have had a long nightmare.

80
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
What did you dream about?

81
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,620
I dreamed that I was dead.

82
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,620
Don't say such unlucky words.

83
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,380
You'll be fine as long as I'm here.

84
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,580
In a few days, you'll be my wife.

85
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
When you think of it...

86
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,140
A'Long, I have a secret to tell you.

87
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Go ahead.

88
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Go to hell.

89
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,580
All the people of the Xi family died because of you.

90
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,340
Pei Lang, I'm going to kill you.

91
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,420
That's a dream.

92
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,140
A dream?

93
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,100
I'd rather die than give you a chance to hurt the Xi family.

94
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Pei Lang, I want you to die!

95
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
What a pity!

96
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,140
Even if I die again,

97
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
nothing will change.

98
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm going to kill you.

111
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,340
I'll arrest her.

112
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,520
Father!

113
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,420
It is a folklore...

114
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,680
Confucian.

115
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
The soul of the dead has awakened.

116
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Your Highness, if you stimulate her like this,

117
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
she will hate you.

118
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,780
There are so many people in this world who hate me.

119
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
There is one person who is not bad.

120
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Take her back.

121
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Yes.

122
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Miss Shen,

123
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
the soul of the dead is a gift from the heavens.

124
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Increasing the power of the soul is the only way to cultivate it.

125
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
The soul of the dead is the only way to cultivate it.

126
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
The people who were unable to hold the teeth of the dead

127
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
are mostly weak.

128
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
The soul of the dead is the only way to cultivate it.

129
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
The people who were unable to hold the teeth of the dead

130
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
are mostly weak.

131
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Therefore,

132
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
at the beginning of the teeth,

133
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
the soul power is unstable.

134
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Just like you are now.

135
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
When the soul power is unstable,

136
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
the cultivation of the dead will be affected

137
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
and the vicious cycle will occur.

138
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
Exactly.

139
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Therefore, for the Cangwu tribe,

140
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
the talent that comes from birth

141
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
is the most important thing to go on this path.

142
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,060
The talented can become the strong.

143
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
The rest of the people

144
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,060
will be unable to reach the starting point of the previous life.

145
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Miss Shen,

146
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
actually, the prince is...

147
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
I know.

148
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,060
I reacted when I woke up from my dream.

149
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
He is trying to stimulate my awakening.

150
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Everyone can see the deepest hatred

151
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
in the illusion.

152
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Sometimes, the power of hatred

153
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
is much stronger than love.

154
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
I wonder who Miss Shen saw.

155
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Miss Shen, the soul is dead.

156
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Miss Shen!

157
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
You are really useless.

158
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Since it is so,

159
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
you are not qualified to be my blade.

160
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,740
The prince didn't want to see me as a blade.

161
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
He said that to help me,

162
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
he would give me the sword.

163
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
But I didn't know what the sword was.

164
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I was afraid that the sword would be too sharp.

165
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
I didn't want to hurt you.

166
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I just wanted to help you.

167
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
I didn't want to hurt you.

168
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
I didn't want to hurt you.

169
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
You said that you wanted to help me to awaken the soul.

170
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Actually, you just wanted to test me.

171
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
What do you want to test?

172
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I want to test whether I am Xi He.

173
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Otherwise, why did you change your appearance to Pei Lang?

174
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Because you know that

175
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,740
General Xi He cares about Pei Lang the most.

176
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,740
It's a pity that I am not Xi He.

177
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Xi He doesn't care about him.

178
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
You should wake up.

179
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Your blood is still useful.

180
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Otherwise...

181
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
The End

182
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
The End

183
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
The End

184
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
The End

185
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
The End
