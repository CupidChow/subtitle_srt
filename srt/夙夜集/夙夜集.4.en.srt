1
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,460
She'll send him to Hell.

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,420
Evil will rule imagery.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,120
She'll send him to Hell?

4
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,740
No no!

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,020
Eunuch we'll excitement.

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,060
Then why bring him to Hell?

7
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,660
What are you blaming?

8
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,540
Zha consent of Your Highness?!

9
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm jealous.

10
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
You haven't answered me

11
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
why you want to be the Crown Princess.

12
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,540
Your Highness,

13
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
in the power game,

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
only the closest position to the throne

15
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,540
can give the most deadly blow.

16
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Only by letting him trust me and rely on me

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
and see me as the closest ally

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,540
can he control his secrets

19
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
and control his decisions

20
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
when he is least aware of it

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,540
and even change the direction of the entire court.

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
Nonsense.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
When you have the power,

24
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,540
the first one to be killed is me.

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
If I'm not wrong,

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Pei Lang will attack you soon.

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
The West Family betrays the people and the people's families.

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
They will definitely ask you to clear the mess.

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,540
When the West Family is destroyed,

30
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
your Phoenix Flower blooms in the West Family.

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Do you think this flaw will lose its goodwill?

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
You are not stupid.

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,540
We are.

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
I'm not stupid.

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
I'm not stupid.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
We are.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
If so,

38
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll wait and see.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,540
Please help me awaken my soul.

40
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
From now on,

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
I'm your sword.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,540
You can't bear to see me hurt?

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
Then why don't you tell me not to go to the battlefield?

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
You are the natural general.

46
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
I really respect you.

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
How can I put you in a corner?

48
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,540
A'he,

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
remember,

50
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
you have to be careful.

51
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
I'll be careful.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
I'll be careful.

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
I'll be careful.

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
A'he,

55
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
remember,

56
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
no matter what happens,

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
I won't break your wings.

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,540
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,540
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,540
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,540
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,540
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,540
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,540
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
I'mss40

92
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,500
the pleasant

93
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,540
mother

94
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,480
daughter

95
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm scared to make my son

96
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,540
attacked

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,540
don't worry

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm不行

99
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,000
heart

100
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,920
to

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,440
why

102
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,680
Spring

103
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,340
the

104
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Milky Way

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,520
immediately

106
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
spread

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
I'll report to the Crown Prince.

108
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,180
Hurry.

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,180
Your Highness.

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,280
Did he hear what he should hear?

111
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,080
Yes.

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
He even left this.

113
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Begonia?

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
It seems that he is the Crown Prince.

115
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,580
Yes.

116
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,080
He is the Crown Prince.

117
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
It seems that he wants to test the Crown Prince.

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Change to this.

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Your Highness.

120
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
If my good nephew knew that the new life came,

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
he wouldn't leave me a chance.

122
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,580
Your Highness.

123
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,080
As you expected,

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
the Crown Prince will make a big move at the meeting tomorrow.

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
He is indeed my good nephew.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Your Majesty.

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Your Majesty.

128
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Your Majesty, bad news.

129
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Your Majesty.

130
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
The people of the capital are gathered at the gate of the palace.

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
They want to ask for the release of the new life.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
If the people's wishes are too big,

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
the country will be in a bad shape.

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Please decide as soon as possible.

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Your Majesty.

136
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Your Majesty.

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
The news has spread.

138
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,080
His Highness's soul has appeared in the Western House.

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
He stopped the tea-tasting.

140
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,080
He also made a big move on the tea-tasting.

141
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,080
The people think that His Highness is in the throne.

142
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
He is involved with the Western House.

143
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
His Highness has always been arrogant.

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I heard that His Highness is involved with the forbidden magic.

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
He wants to live forever.

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I think we should...

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Enough.

148
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Stop talking.

149
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Your Majesty.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Father, please calm down.

151
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,080
All the officials are just eager to share your worries.

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I am willing to ask for permission to investigate the rest of the Western House.

153
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
In that case,

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I will leave this matter to you.

155
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
But you have to remember

156
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
not to wrong your uncle.

157
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Yes.

158
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Lang'er.

159
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Do you blame me

160
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
for being partial to your uncle?

161
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I dare not.

162
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
I am not as good as my uncle.

163
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
You know that

164
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
this is your advantage.

165
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
It's because your mother's clan dragged you down.

166
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
They isolated you from the Crown Prince.

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,080
You have been under great pressure.

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I will not let you down.

169
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Without Tianzi,

170
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
it's not enough to work hard.

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Look at your uncle.

172
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
He is a little bit arrogant

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
and a little bit arrogant.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
But because he is a noble man,

175
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
he has the most spiritual power.

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Please rest assured, Father.

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I will work harder.

178
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
That's good.

179
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I have lived in the capital for many years.

180
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
I have never been here.

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
You know where to find it.

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I often come here with my parents.

183
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
What is this?

184
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
This incense is called Lingxi incense.

185
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
It is a special incense from Lingxi Tower.

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,080
It is what my mother loved in her life.

187
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
It's not common.

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I heard that the Crown Prince

189
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
has been seducing the officials recently.

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,080
He said that you colluded with the Xi family.

191
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Such a vicious plot.

192
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,080
You have the evidence of it.

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Why don't you expose it?

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
The Xi family is powerful and powerful.

195
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
But they are all corrupt.

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
It's a good thing.

197
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
If you don't use it well,

198
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
you will not be ashamed of your soul.

199
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't you think so?

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
You are right.

201
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,080
The Crown Prince and you are really good rivals.

202
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
For you,

203
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the Xi family has 44 members.

204
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,080
They are just your pawns who fight for power.

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Of course.

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Have you forgotten?

207
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Hei Lang is my nephew.

208
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,080
We have the same blood.

209
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
People have been talking about

210
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
the wildness of the Crown Prince.

211
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
You must be careful.

212
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
If you have time to worry about me,

213
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
you should worry about yourself.

214
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
What do you worry about me?

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
It's not easy for you to wake up the soul.

216
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm willing to pay whatever the price.

217
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I forgot to ask you.

218
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Why are you so persistent to avenge the Xi family?

219
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
The Xi family once had a favor for me.

220
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
It's a long time ago.

221
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
It's good to know the favor.

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,080
But are you sure that Xi He is dead?

223
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
The whole family was killed.

224
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Everyone knows it.

225
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
If you look closely,

226
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,080
you really look like Xi He.

227
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
You're kidding.

228
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,080
It's not my appearance, it's my personality.

229
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
There's something special about me.

230
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
What is it?

231
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I can't turn back.

232
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Xi He has something to say.

234
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
General Xi He,

235
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
you've been working hard.

236
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I want to visit the Prince.

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
I hope you can help me.

239
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
This...

240
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
The Prince's mansion is half full.

241
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Your Majesty, Xi He went to the border

242
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
to see the lives of the people.

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
But the Prince is so poor

244
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
that he becomes the residence of the Cang Wu.

245
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,080
He looks for some treasures every day.

246
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
I think it's no good for the people.

247
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
General Xi He,

248
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
you're too biased.

249
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,080
The Prince's use is about the dignity of the royal family.

250
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,080
But the people have to consider it.

251
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
How about this?

252
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Reduce the use of the palace by half

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
and distribute it to the border?

254
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
You...

256
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
His Majesty is too biased.

257
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
He's so kind.

258
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Even the Crown Prince doesn't treat him like this.

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
General Xi He,

260
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
please wait.

261
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Your love is the blessing of the people.

262
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,080
But there's one thing I don't understand.

263
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Why do you look down on me?

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
You spend all your money on the people,

265
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
but you don't care about the people.

266
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
We're different.

267
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
We're not related.

268
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
You're so wrong.

269
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
You really don't care about the people.

270
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,080
I have no feelings for the Prince.

271
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Xi He,

272
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,080
you'll regret it one day.

273
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I never regret it.

274
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Xi He,

275
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Don't let Pei Su find out my true identity.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I only give you one chance to awaken the soul.

277
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
If you fail,

278
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
you don't have to live.

279
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
I'll train you.

280
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Your Highness,

281
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Miss Shen may not be able to take it.

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Your Highness!

283
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
The rules are simple.

284
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I'll aim at the sword you're using.

285
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,080
You need to try your best to build up your soul.

286
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
If you can block it, you'll live.

287
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
If you can't, you'll die.

288
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I only have one chance to awaken my soul.

289
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
I've seen this before.

290
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I only have one chance to awaken my soul.

291
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I've seen this before.

292
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
I've seen this before.

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
I've seen this before.

294
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
I've seen this before.

295
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
I've seen this before.

296
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
I've seen this before.

297
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I've seen this before.

298
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
I've seen this before.

299
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I've seen this before.

300
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
I've seen this before.

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
I've seen this before.

302
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
I've seen this before.

303
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
The flowers bloom again,

304
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
year after year.

305
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
The soul is back to its original state.

306
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
The soul is back to its original state.

307
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
I miss you.

308
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
You're the only one I have.

309
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
You're the only one I have.

310
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
The flowers bloom again,

311
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
the wind blows the leaves.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll be the wind that blows the leaves.

313
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
I'll be the wind that blows the leaves.

314
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
I'll be the wind that blows the leaves.

315
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I'll be the wind that blows the leaves.

316
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
I'll be the wind that blows the leaves.

317
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Therefore mother.

318
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
The shadow of f navigation

319
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
will live in their hands forever.

320
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
In their hands forever.

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Your hand Kirari will also be at the back.

322
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Your hand Kirari will also be at the back.

323
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Behind them, the water on ups,

324
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
like a cast escape the sword power.

325
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Bakura

326
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Baka

327
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Open-minded

328
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Straight直
