00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yummyヤ

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yummy

3
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,500
Who do I kill?

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,920
My beautiful sister

5
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,000
Out of my way

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
so

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
You forgot to greet your sister today

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,460
That's letting youение

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,380
Hi

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,640
Fine, I forget to follow the

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Fine, I forget to follow the eating rules

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,960
Hi

13
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,880
Let go!

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,040
You can have my life

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
as you want.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
Zhen... Zhen Yan!

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,720
Shen Qian Yi!

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,160
Don't think the Crown Prince will send you back!

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,120
Just wait!

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm the Crown Princess!

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
Your Highness

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
Qiu Xia

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,360
My discontinuous nephew

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,320
just said he was studying in the Botanic Farm

25
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
It's so great.

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Silly girl.

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
Isn't it?

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm back.

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
Second Young Mistress.

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Second Young Mistress.

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,840
It's so great that you're fine.

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,200
Why are you sleeping here?

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm afraid it's too dark

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
and you can't see the way back.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,240
Fortunately, I'm here.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,160
You've recovered so well.

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Xiaoyin,

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
Thank you.

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,480
Now, you're fine.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
Second Young Mistress,

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
take care of yourself

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
when you're away recently.

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,040
Madam will be just a week' late.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,960
Your Highness.

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Your Highness.

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
Miss Liancheng's birth mother,

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
Jian Heying.

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,520
Mother, you're finally back.

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,000
Ling'er, don't cry.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,960
If you cry,

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll break my heart.

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
Mother,

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,640
Shen Qianye

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,760
has become strong.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
He dares to hurt me.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Look.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
He even said

58
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
he wanted to take the throne

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,280
of my Crown Princess.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm really sick of him.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
You're so childish.

62
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,520
You even thought of

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
becoming the Crown Princess?

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,920
Mother,

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,160
but

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,000
the throne will be taken in a few days.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,960
Father only knows how to write the name of the legitimate daughter.

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm sure he won't be able to do it.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,040
Even if father gets angry,

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,320
I...

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,920
It's fine.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
I'm here.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,280
If he can't do it,

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
I have a way

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,280
to help you.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
All right.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,680
Don't cry.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
Ling'er

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,240
is going to be the Crown Princess.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Ling'er knows

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,840
that you're the best.

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,800
Mother,

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
you must kill him

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
in front of everyone tomorrow.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Or he'll

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
be blamed by you.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,640
All right.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,680
I promise you

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,880
I'll

90
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
vent my anger on you tomorrow.

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,960
Your father will be in the tomb tomorrow.

92
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
He's not at home.

93
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,320
Let me,

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
your mother,

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
teach him

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,080
how to find a son-in-law.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,880
My Lady,

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Madam asked you to go to the ancestral hall this morning.

99
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
It must be a bad thing.

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Master left early today.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm afraid...

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
It's all right.

103
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
The ice will make the water run.

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
I have my own way.

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Ying,

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,760
do me a favor.

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
You're a rude girl.

108
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Do you know your mistake?

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,200
Kneel!

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
The art of holding a sword is hard to follow.

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,120
People can kneel to their ancestors

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
and the heaven and earth,

113
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
but they can't do it

114
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,880
because of the mistake they made.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
You dare to hit your sister

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
regardless of your age.

117
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,360
It's a mistake.

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm just trying to protect myself.

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Sister,

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
if you want to be respected by your sister,

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
then show yourself as a sister.

122
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,480
Mother,

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
stop talking nonsense.

124
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,280
You two, go.

125
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Today,

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
I'll teach you a good lesson

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
in front of the ancestors

128
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,280
of the Shen Family.

129
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,640
I'm the daughter of the Shen Family.

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,880
You two,

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
a sister and a daughter-in-law,

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
what qualifications do you have?

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
I want to tell father.

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Then we'll see

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,560
if you can live until that time.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Hit!

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
You two haven't eaten yet.

138
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,200
Give it to me.

139
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Shen Qianyan,

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
you deserve it.

141
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,520
Shen Qianyan 트

142
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,720
Shen Qianyan

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,040
Zhen成

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,960
Stop.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,480
Brother Shen,

146
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
it's so impolite

147
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,000
to abuse the enemy's daughter like this.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't tell anyone.

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,200
You're a official.

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
How can you be a minister?

151
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
Don't tell anyone.

152
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,720
It wasn't like this before.

153
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,280
This...

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,520
It's the first time I've seen it.

155
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
Sir, don't tell anyone.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
If it's known,

157
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,400
what should I do?

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,920
Tell me.

159
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
Please, my lords.

160
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,760
Mother.

161
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
I heard from the servant

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,120
that it's because of you

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
that someone came to visit

164
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
because of the weapons.

165
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
That's why father came back.

166
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
Could it be

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
Shen Qianyan?

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,720
Your father is embarrassed.

169
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,960
I'm worried

170
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
that Qianqiuye's reputation

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,760
will fall on his head.

172
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,520
Mother, what should we do?

173
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Second Miss.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,280
Second Miss.

175
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,920
Are you...

176
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,040
Are you okay?

177
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm fine.

178
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't worry.

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Second Miss.

180
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
You're so wise.

181
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
You're really anxious.

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,840
What should we do next?

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,520
Let's wait and see.

184
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,160
The doctor of Jian'e

185
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
wants to please father.

186
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,160
He'll only get what he wants.

187
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,440
When people have a clear mind,

188
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
they'll easily make mistakes.

189
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
By then, we'll just

190
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
follow the flow and see what's right.

191
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,400
I've been wanting to ask you.

192
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
How do you know

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,680
that the master will come back today?

194
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,920
Master Lu likes weapons the most.

195
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
So I told you to tell him

196
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,360
that there's a new weapon in the house.

197
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Father has been trying to please him.

198
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
He'll bring him back.

199
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Then I'll tell the master

200
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,160
that you were bullied again today.

201
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
Isn't it faster?

202
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
Only by attracting everyone's attention

203
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
can father be relieved.

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Otherwise,

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,800
with your words,

206
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,640
even if he knows

207
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
that I was abused,

208
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,560
he won't admit it

209
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,080
even if he's embarrassed.

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
He won't come back.

211
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,640
Be careful.

212
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm really fine.

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,240
Lady Yuzhan,

214
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,120
why did you recover so fast

215
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,520
after being beaten?

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
There are skills

217
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
in the skill of suffering.

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
This is a blood pill.

219
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
Lady Yuzhan, you're amazing.

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,720
Where did you learn it?

221
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,080
I learned it from my father.

222
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Father, I'm going to be beaten.

223
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
You want me to read?

224
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
You don't need to.

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,520
It's nothing.

226
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
An old friend taught me.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
Steward, give it to me.

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,800
Lady Yuzhan, let go.

229
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,880
Give it to me.

230
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Lady Yuzhan, let go.

231
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,640
Steward.

232
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,320
Mother.

233
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Mother.

234
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
Mother.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
Why did you give Shen Qianyuan

236
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
those good things?

237
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
He doesn't deserve them.

238
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,760
All right, sit down.

239
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,480
You silly girl.

240
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,160
I did this for you.

241
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Didn't you notice?

242
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,760
Your father's anger was gone yesterday.

243
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Really?

244
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,440
That's great.

245
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,800
Then,

246
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,960
Father said

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,440
you're going to gather the whole family today.

248
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Are you going to send me

249
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
to the banquet?

250
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
Of course.

251
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,320
Father.

252
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,560
Father.

253
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Father, when are you going to

254
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,240
send me to the banquet?

255
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
Do you think I can do it?

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,200
Father.

257
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,160
What are you going to do?

258
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,280
Look at what you two did.

259
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,040
We didn't do anything.

260
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Didn't do anything?

261
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,200
You didn't agree to

262
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,960
send me to the banquet.

263
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,920
Now everyone is talking about

264
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,160
my ungrateful daughter.

265
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,360
Don't think that

266
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,840
you can get rid of this matter

267
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,240
by sending Qian Yi some clothes.

268
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,520
You did it with her the other day.

269
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,880
I haven't dealt with you yet.

270
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,640
I know my mistake.

271
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Mother.

272
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,360
Anyway,

273
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,720
Qianqiu banquet

274
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,000
is going to Qianye.

275
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,760
Father.

276
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,120
Go.

277
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Go.

278
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Father.

279
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,920
Qianye went.

280
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,680
What a pity.

281
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,040
I don't think it's necessary.

282
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
What do you mean?

283
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,680
Think about it.

284
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,320
Who is so capable

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,200
to help the second lady get out of the mansion

286
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
and send her home safely?

287
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,400
Is it the Crown Prince?

288
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,240
That night,

289
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,880
I saw the carriage of the Crown Prince's mansion

290
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,040
send the second lady back.

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,840
Master.

292
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Even the Queen

293
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
has to listen to the Crown Prince.

294
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,440
My daughter used to be lonely and weak.

295
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Why suddenly all the money comes to me?

296
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,240
She don't need to be Aa you a cent amongst us.

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,000
If she doesn't want to invite sorrow,

298
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,760
maybe she can

299
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
get peace to me soon which will be extremely possible.

300
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,680
deceived order from Challenge.

301
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
The one who will be sent to the Empress's banquet

302
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,920
is the legitimate daughter, Shen Qianye.

303
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Let's go in and have some tea.

304
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,040
Okay.

305
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm busy with this matter.

306
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,480
It's been a long journey.

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
This way, please.

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Shen Qianye,

309
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,040
don't think that you can be a phoenix

310
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,080
just by flying on your head.

311
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
Just wait to be embarrassed

312
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,000
at the banquet.

313
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
Thank you for your reminder.

314
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,160
You carry on.

315
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,600
Would you like to drink together?

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,920
Sure.

317
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,080
With another pair.

318
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,040
Quick.

319
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,920
and another pair.

320
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
I've never seen this before.

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,680
Take a look first.

322
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Wait a moment.

323
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,280
You have a lot of things to see.

324
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm really nervous.

325
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Let's go.

326
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Let's go.

327
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
In this life,

328
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I only want to see you.

329
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,680
The Heavens are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

330
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,680
The people are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

331
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Behind me is you,

332
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,680
who dares to break through the barrier of the four walls.

333
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
The wind blows the flowers and the snow falls.

334
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
The people are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

335
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,680
The wind blows the flowers and the snow falls.

336
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,680
The blood does not burn, the heart does not care.

337
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,680
The end is the end.

338
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,680
In this life,

339
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,680
I only want to see you.

340
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,680
The Heavens are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

341
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,680
The people are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,680
The wind blows the flowers and the snow falls.

343
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,680
The people are the only ones who can set the world on fire.

344
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,680
The wind blows the flowers and the snow falls.

345
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,680
The people are the only ones who can set the world on fire.
