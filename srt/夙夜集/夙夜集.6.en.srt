1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:25,660
Rudolf's

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
Of course, you can't try.

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,280
What?

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,240
What's that?

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Your Highness,

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,160
even without the soul,

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
I should take it to deal with the Crown Prince.

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,360
Your Highness,

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
the Crown Prince has surrounded the mansion.

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
The opportunity has come.

11
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
You haven't gone out at all.

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Second Uncle,

13
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
please come with me.

14
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,520
You don't even let me know if I'm dead?

15
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Uncle,

16
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,720
I've been ordered by His Majesty

17
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,520
to investigate the case of the West's family.

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Now,

19
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I suspect that you are involved in this case.

20
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Where's the evidence?

21
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
This token

22
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
belongs to you, right?

23
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,120
But it appeared in the West's mansion.

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
Uncle,

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,520
can you explain it to me?

26
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes.

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Bring it here.

28
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
A few days ago,

29
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
a thief came out of the mansion

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,520
and stole this token from me.

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
I have to thank Zhi'er

32
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
for finding the missing item

33
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
so that I won't wrongly accuse him.

34
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,520
It's a coincidence.

36
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,720
I thought he was just stealing the property of the mansion.

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,720
But I didn't expect that this token

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,320
was actually in Zhi'er's hands.

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Could it be that he was ordered by someone

40
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,720
to frame me?

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Your Highness, please save me.

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,520
In that case,

43
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,720
I'll leave this thief to you.

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
It was a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
I've disturbed you.

46
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Please forgive me.

47
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
It's okay.

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Uncle, are you all right?

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm fine.

50
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Thank you for your concern.

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I'll leave now.

52
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll go to the mansion.

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Let's go.

54
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
Miss Shen guessed that the Crown Prince

55
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,520
would cause trouble this morning.

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
She's right.

57
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Oh, right.

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Your Highness,

59
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,320
this is the box of spiritual breath that Miss Shen gave you.

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
She said thank you for giving her a chance.

61
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
It's her.

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
It's her turn now.

63
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,520
Miss Shen?

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Your Highness.

65
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Your Highness, please save me.

66
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,320
I should go.

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Thank you for saving me, Your Highness.

68
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Miss Shen,

69
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
don't need to say thank you,

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
These are all little books?

71
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
How ridiculous!

72
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
It's beyond the law!

73
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Last time, the Crown Prince asked me

74
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
if I was willing to leave with you.

75
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I dreamt about leaving that tomb every night.

76
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
But the Prince won't let me go.

77
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Your Highness, I even hurt him.

78
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
What should I do?

79
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Can you save me?

80
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Can you take me away from the Prince

81
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
and send me back to the government?

82
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
As far as I know,

83
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
there are many maids in Uncle's manor.

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Why did he target the girl?

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I...

86
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I...

87
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Don't be afraid.

88
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I know the secret of the Prince.

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I...

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Here's your chance.

91
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
What chance?

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Use his hand to send me back to the government.

93
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
By the way, the Crown Prince came so soon.

94
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm sure there are also traitors in your manor.

95
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Why don't you use your old tricks to get them out?

96
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
You really worked hard

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
to marry the Crown Prince.

98
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You flatter me.

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Indeed.

100
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
No man is willing to

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
marry his own enemy.

102
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
And you rejected him.

103
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,920
So the best way to gain Pei Lang's trust is

104
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
to betray me.

105
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Your Highness, are you afraid that I'll fake the real thing?

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Isn't it more interesting?

107
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
But I'm curious

108
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
what kind of meeting gift you prepared for the Crown Prince.

109
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Of course,

110
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
your fatal weakness.

111
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,920
The night of the full moon, the most powerful will be injured.

112
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Are you serious?

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I'm afraid.

114
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
It's not enough.

115
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
You need to be so strict.

116
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll kill you.

117
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
You're not afraid of me?

118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
You need to be so strict.

119
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
It's enough.

120
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Your Highness, I think you like the Lingxi incense.

121
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
You've been waiting for days.

122
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I don't like it.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
If so, I'll throw it away.

124
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Don't move.

125
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
We'll talk about it in a few days.

126
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes.

127
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Your Highness.

128
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Your Highness.

129
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
How's your injury?

130
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
It's fine.

131
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
To be honest,

132
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
did Pei Lang trust you?

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
I've made a deal with Pei Lang.

134
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
He'll take me out of the mansion and send me home safely.

135
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
I'll tell him your secret.

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
After I get home,

137
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
let my father build a steel roof.

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I'll get the right to attend the Queen's banquet.

139
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Every official in the capital can only build one steel roof.

140
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Your father will be punished.

141
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Your Highness, you underestimate me.

142
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I have my own way.

143
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
But you...

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
The Crown Prince knows your weakness.

145
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You have to be careful on the night of the full moon.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Don't die.

147
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Don't worry.

148
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Miss, His Highness wants me to tell you

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
that you can go home after getting in the carriage.

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Thank you for your kindness.

151
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm very grateful.

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
In that case,

153
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
here's what His Highness wants.

154
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Here's what His Highness wants.

155
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Your Highness,

156
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Miss Shen has got on the Crown Prince's carriage.

157
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Your Highness,

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Miss Shen should be fine.

159
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
The brothers in the mansion said

160
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
that she hurt His Highness before

161
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
and was beaten into the dark room

162
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
and tortured for several days.

163
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Interesting.

164
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
It seems that

165
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
the good show is about to begin.

166
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
consists of

167
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,760
The facts and informations don't fully properly reflect the real events

168
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,200
I will follow you, year after year,

169
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,320
I hope that we can be together in the future.

170
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
I miss you, I miss you,

171
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
I miss you, I miss you,

172
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
I miss you, I miss you,

173
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I miss you, I miss you,

174
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I miss you, I miss you,

175
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
I miss you, I miss you,

176
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I miss you, I miss you,

177
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
I miss you, I miss you,

178
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I miss you, I miss you,

179
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
I miss you, I miss you,

180
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I miss you, I miss you,

181
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I miss you, I miss you,

182
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I miss you, I miss you,

183
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
I miss you, I miss you,

184
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I miss you, I miss you,

185
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
I miss you, I miss you,

186
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I miss you, I miss you,

187
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
I miss you, I miss you,

188
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
I miss you, I miss you,

189
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
