00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,560
After Lan's death, Introduå‰‡ Fortress Alexei Zviagin,

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Goahaha Open,

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Emperor protects Altair,

4
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Did you really give up on that woman?

6
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
How can a woman who doesn't know how to behave

7
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
be compared to the country?

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Father,

9
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
I've been in the middle of everything.

10
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I've been in the middle of everything.

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I've been in the middle of everything.

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I've been in the middle of everything.

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
That's not love.

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
What is it then?

15
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
It's not love.

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Why?

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Why did Pei Su get his love?

18
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I'm the Crown Prince of Cangwu!

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm not willing to lose to him!

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Well said!

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
That's my good son!

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
You must remember this feeling.

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Go...

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Go and get back everything that belongs to us.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
But...

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,960
This is the last chance that I give you.

27
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Go...

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
What's wrong?

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,960
You've been working so hard all these years.

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Thank you for becoming Pei Su.

31
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I know it's not easy for you.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,960
The Crown Prince of Cangwu will be here tomorrow morning.

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
This time,

35
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'll protect you.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,960
The Xi family has been protecting the goddess of Cangqing for generations.

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
They only respect the real king of Cangwu.

38
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Father...

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Sir, you can leave this matter to our servants.

40
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Why do you have to come out again?

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
This young man is wrong.

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Marriage is a life-long matter.

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
According to the old tradition,

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
only when the husband is close to you,

45
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
can you be together forever.

46
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
You're right.

47
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
I'll call him.

48
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Okay.

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Sir, someone wants to see you.

50
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
They want to discuss something important.

51
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
What is it?

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
It's about the king.

53
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
He's here.

54
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Pei Lang?

55
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Lang, you lied to father again.

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Luckily, your nephew is not like father.

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Blood needle!

58
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Go!

59
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Blood needle!

60
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
You killed the priest!

61
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
You're right.

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
You're really my good brother.

63
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
I'll finish you today.

65
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
No!

66
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
You think I'll lose like this?

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Lang,

68
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
father is sorry.

69
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Oh no, he has a heart attack.

70
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Lang!

71
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Pei Lang!

72
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Lang,

73
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
I'll leave you alone.

76
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I'm leaving.

77
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Whether you're happy or not,

78
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
as long as I can see you, it's good.

79
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Xi He!

80
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
You're the general of the heavens.

81
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,960
You're really the one who can't lock you up in the shell.

82
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
If I come back safe and sound,

84
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll be happy to spend a hundred years with you.

85
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
If you die on the battlefield,

86
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'll never leave you.

87
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Stop laughing!

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
It's all your fault.

89
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Look, he's really cute.

90
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Look!

91
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
He, remember,

92
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
no matter when,

93
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I won't break your wings.

94
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Pei Lang!

95
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Pei Lang!

96
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Pei Lang!

97
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Good brother.

98
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Now it's your turn.

99
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
No!

100
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
No!

101
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
No!

102
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
If you're happy,

103
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
and your mind is not stable,

104
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
you can get your soul back.

105
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
This is my soul.

106
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Pei Lang!

107
00:11:44,960 --> 00:12:01,860
The king of the

108
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Summer

109
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Dad, dad.

110
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Come here.

111
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Go find dad.

112
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Dad.

113
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Go to the kitchen.

114
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Yes.

115
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
A'he, A'he.

116
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Li Niang ignores us again.

117
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Who said that?

118
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
This general is busier than me.

119
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Come on, let's go.

120
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Run, run.

121
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Stop it.

122
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Don't run.

123
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Run, run.

124
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Stop.

125
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Be careful.

126
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Slow down.

127
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Stop.

128
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Stop.

129
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Stop.

130
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Stop.

131
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
The End
