1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,360
KILL його

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Explain!

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All this time

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you using me?

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There are some things

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I just know

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Did you go to the Xixi's house that day?

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What did you do?

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Say

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Say something!

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Take it

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll take you home

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll take you home

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Who's so good at it?

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You think you won?

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You think my father will help you again?

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
His guards saw you using the forbidden spell

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You think I'm the only one who can use the forbidden spell?

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I know you want to frame me

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But you really don't know

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not the only one who can use the forbidden spell

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You want to frame me

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But Pei Lang

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't you want to know the truth?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The truth is

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You, Pei Su

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Killed the whole family

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
To practice the forbidden spell

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Killed countless people

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Soon

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Everything will be white

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You only care about your father

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What did you say?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I said

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You will never get your father's attention

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because your mother's family is always inferior to him

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm his only son

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He cares about me the most

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't need it at all

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't need it

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I tell you

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tomorrow

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll go to get Shen Qianye tomorrow

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shen Qianye

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's mine

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Cang Wuguo is mine

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Everything is mine

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't deserve to fight with me

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was going to fight

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're going to be a dead man

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's the point of fighting with me?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Highness

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to ask Shen Qianye

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How to deal with Shen Qianye

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you think?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I understand

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will send someone to deal with it as soon as possible

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you betray the Crown Prince

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You will be killed

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She is about to be my Crown Princess

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who dares to disrespect the Crown Princess

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't see it

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You really have a soul in me

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can come and save me anytime

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Aren't you disappointed?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I actually retreated at this time

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hate makes people strong

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Love makes people retreat

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yansuo

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you crying?

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are wrong

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I heard from the people in the mansion

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Crown Prince wants to get married right away

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Marry the lady to be the Crown Princess

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Prepare the dowry

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Whether you are Xihe

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As long as I can see you

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's really you

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I thought you forgot me

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was wrong

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I regret it

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Regret what?

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I regret not leaving you

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I shouldn't have let you go back to the Xi family

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I knew that the Xi family was going to be destroyed

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Destroyed

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Didn't the Xi family commit suicide for the crime?

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I regret letting you go home

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I still can't help looking for you

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's too late

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's too late

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What do you know?

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Prince

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Prince

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Prince

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How is Shen Qianye?

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did the Crown Prince hit her?

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But she will become the Crown Princess tomorrow

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Pei Lang won't marry a woman who has betrayed him

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Shen Qianye is in danger

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I have to find her

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Prince

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The Crown Prince has already planned the Xi family's destruction

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The King Longyan has already decided to kill the Crown Prince

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your Majesty

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The King Longyan is angry and ordered to kill Zhan

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We need to leave the city quickly

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Give me a clock

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Prince, you can't go

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I came to you

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have something to tell you

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Did you say you were framed?

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was framed by Pei Lang

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I know

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He framed you

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But you are also guilty

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You did practice the forbidden arts

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And destroyed the whole Xi family, didn't you?

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's dangerous for you to marry him

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you think I still believe what you say now?

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can not believe me

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can kill me

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But if you have no doubts

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your sword will not be broken

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Come with me

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We will meet at the gate of the city tomorrow

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I won't go

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I won't go

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You go

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will wait for you

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Until you come

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I told you I won't

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are so innocent

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Qianye

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's me

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's me

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Chengqi

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Chengqi, what are you doing here?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm here to save you

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I know you married the Crown Prince because you were forced

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Chengqi

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Chengdi

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How do you know that everyone in the military?

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I am Xi He

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
what

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
impossible

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
General Xi He, he's been

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Now my soul is in Xihe.

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,440
No way.

164
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Don't make fun of me.

165
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,240
You're in the military camp.

166
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,800
I know.

167
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
You write letters to Qian Yin every day.

168
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,600
You hope to see her and marry her.

169
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
I know.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
If you don't want to elope with me,

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
it's okay.

172
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,600
I'll find another way.

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,320
Okay?

174
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,160
In the battle of Taohualing,

175
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,320
your right chest was stabbed three times.

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
There are three arrows.

177
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,320
I saved you that time.

178
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,320
What about...

179
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
What about him?

180
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Did he...

181
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
die?

182
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,480
Yes.

183
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,960
Yes.

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
But he said he would wait for me.

185
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
He said he would wait for me.

186
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,680
I still have a lot of things I haven't done to him.

187
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,080
But he waited for me.

188
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,480
Your Highness.

189
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
After the peace treaty,

190
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,080
the first one to go to find Shen Qianye.

191
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,480
Are we going to act?

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
I will protect Qianye.

193
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,240
But if they leave the capital,

194
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
we won't be able to track them down.

195
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,680
I believe Qianye won't leave with him.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
It's not easy to track them down.

197
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
I'm waiting for him to come to drink with me.

198
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,520
Okay.

199
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,120
Your Highness, let's go.

200
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
We don't have much time.

201
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,280
Wait a little longer.

202
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,480
The Crown Prince has ordered the whole city to track you down.

203
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Staying here for a day is a risk.

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
It's okay.

205
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
I have my own way to deal with it.

206
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,080
Your Highness,

207
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
do you need me to send someone to beg His Majesty?

208
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
His Majesty used to think of his brother.

209
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
He won't really do it.

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
No.

211
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,080
He must not know about our whereabouts.

212
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,640
TOWARDS~)

213
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,680
KILL HIM

214
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm afraid I can't.

215
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
