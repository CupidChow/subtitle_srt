1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,280
you will also find maybe in vivo

2
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,380
i will show you

3
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Episode 16

4
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,380
You are a traitor.

5
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,380
You are a traitor.

6
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,380
How dare you talk about the priest?

7
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,380
How dare you be the king of Cangwu?

8
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
Nonsense!

9
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Guards!

10
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Take this lunatic away!

11
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,380
The Xis are loyal to their families.

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,380
They didn't kill Jiangchang,

13
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,380
but they killed the capital.

14
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,380
They all died under the spell.

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
So,

16
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,380
you have more suspicions.

17
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
He is addicted to the spell.

18
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
Everyone in the capital knows...

19
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,380
You are just a knife.

20
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,380
In the capital,

21
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,380
there is more than one person

22
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,380
who practices the spell.

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
There is one more person?

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
It's him!

25
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,380
Shen Qianye,

26
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,380
you are so arrogant.

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Do you have any evidence?

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Those who are sent to the palace

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
and disappear without a trace

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
are the iron evidences.

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
Write it down.

32
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,380
What do you think?

33
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Shen Qing,

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
this is yours.

35
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
This is mine.

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,380
It's you!

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
How dare you!

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,380
How dare you!

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,380
How dare you!

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Your Majesty!

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,380
Your Majesty!

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
Shen Qianye,

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
you are so righteous.

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
You are so ungrateful.

45
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,380
I wonder if you are satisfied with this result.

46
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Do you think it will work?

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
Not as strong as the seven- personned guests are.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,380
It's my hard work.

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,380
The reptile cardio experienced from deep caves

50
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
forces them to be vegated out by thunder.

51
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,380
And now

52
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,180
there are so many Queen brothers

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
street Juneby and units Maestros.

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,380
So

55
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,820
...theевидest of all?

56
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,500
The Thunder Panic Scorch?

57
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,640
You can't even take lead...

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,000
...or your soul in what you do.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Shen Qianye,

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
do you really believe that there is a god in this world?

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's not a god.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's just an ordinary mortal.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are a shadow of the dead,

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and you are buried in the bones,

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
so you can attract thunder.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Think about it.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who would sacrifice himself for you?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It seems that Pei Su

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
really loves you deeply.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My good brother

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
has always been thoughtful and strict.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I wonder why he is so reckless this time.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it because he is dying soon?

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I heard that Pei Su's soul was lost.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If he is killed by the soul of the dead,

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
he will die soon.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I have a way to save him.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you want my life,

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
or to protect his life?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You choose.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I...

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will take the medicine.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Thunder.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Qianye, I'll help you.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Prince.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The traitor Pei Su,

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
take him back and put him in the prison.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
General.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How dare you!

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take them all down.

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The End

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Prince.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you for saving me.

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You are welcome.

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it's not my credit.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If Qianye didn't hold the prince back,

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I would have found the secret of the anti-evil effect of the Jinchong Dragon.

100
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Otherwise, I can't do it alone.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He...

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Pei Su.

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You...

104
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Bastard!

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The dragon is in danger.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Pei Su.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Shen Qianye.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Shen Qianye.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If they don't destroy the memorial,

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
my soul will be destroyed.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
For so many years,

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have worked so hard for you.

114
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have raised my soul.

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In the end,

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I still can't do anything.

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For so many years,

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I just want to admit it.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a living person here.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Prince.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
General.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll react quickly this time.

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
General.

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
General.

125
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
After the ceremony,

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you have to buy me a drink.

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to drink with the most expensive one in the capital.

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's a deal.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a deal.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
By the way, general.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why did you get caught in the prison on purpose?

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This spiritual pearl is sealed with the soul of the Xi family.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
With the soul of the soul,

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard my father's voice.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This...

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
General.

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What did the old general say?

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Father said

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to bring the spiritual pearl

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and give a drop of the king's blood to Changqing Gu Rong.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then he would know the secret of the King of Cangwu.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll accompany you.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's not too late.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
General.

145
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's go.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Where is my secret?

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where is my secret?

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Go to the prison.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
General, be careful.

151
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
General.

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm fine.

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No.

154
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is the blood dragon array

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that King of Cangwu has built.

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You guys, go.

157
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Go.

158
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Go.

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's good.

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't.

161
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm fine.

162
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm fine.

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm fine.

164
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm fine.

165
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm fine.

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm fine.

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm fine.

168
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm fine.

169
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm fine.

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm fine.

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm fine.

172
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm fine.

173
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm fine.

174
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm fine.

175
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm fine.

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm fine.

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm fine.

178
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm fine.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm fine.

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm fine.

181
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm fine.

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm fine.

183
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm fine.

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm fine.

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm fine.

186
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm fine.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm fine.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm fine.

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm fine.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm fine.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm fine.

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm fine.

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm fine.

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
