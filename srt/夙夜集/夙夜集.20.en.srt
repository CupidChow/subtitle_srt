1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The End

2
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I never thought that after getting heavily wounded,

3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Pei Su's motherly spirit is still so strong.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a pity that I couldn't control her completely.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Your Majesty, now that the Xi family has fallen,

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the star head is in a big trouble.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's still important to preserve the dragon body.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
As for the prince, there will be a time to take care of him.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Although he failed to follow the order,

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
he can never find his memory of tonight.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hmph.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This place is full of bandits.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They are trying to kill the people.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just give it to my good brother.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No!

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Impossible!

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is all fake.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Father clearly told me that

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
this is the Xi family's fault.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Xi family?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How could this be?

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How could this be?

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's you.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The murderer must be you!

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My father is the most wise king in the world.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How could he do such a thing?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hei Lang,

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
will the holy statue of the goddess Changqing be a lie?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We are of the same race.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You should know very well.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's all fake.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's all fake.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Leave.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You traitors!

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How dare you hurt the crown prince!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You deserve to die!

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Although your status is important,

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you are a child after all.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't avoid losing your feelings.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If...

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will definitely help you

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
to make the right choice.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why are you standing there?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Kill him!

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Leave now!

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Pesu, are you okay?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Lord Cang Wu must have calculated

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that today is the full moon night.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's why he chose to do it today.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Leave me alone.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Leave now.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The moon will not last long.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They will catch up soon.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How could I

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
do this to you?

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you were here today,

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would have left without hesitation.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Only the snake can have the virtue.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Xing,

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you understand this better than I do.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Leave.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Leave now!

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Leave now!

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mother!

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mother, he's awake.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's awake.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's great.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He's awake.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me,

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
have you seen a lady?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lady?

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sir, your wound.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who is that lady?

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Is she so important?

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I must tell you,

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
she is my wife.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We came back from the West,

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
but we met bandits.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's why we were injured and lost face.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I must find her no matter what.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will repay her kindness with my life.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
See you next time.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A Su,

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
your wound is not healed yet.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where are you going?

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A Fu, let's go.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Husband.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You wrote the medicine.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Not only that,

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
do you know how much time I spent

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
carrying you here?

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I tell you,

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you owe me all this.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You owe me everything.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
From now on,

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you must return everything

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
one by one.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will do my best.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This village is called the light village.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because these villagers

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are good at lighting the lamps,

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
they are good at making candles.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This place is not far from the capital,

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but it is hidden in the valley.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
they won't catch up for now.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We should leave as soon as possible

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because of the long night.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes,

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but Wang Shen said a few days ago

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
there was a storm here.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The only way out of the village was destroyed.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What should we do?

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How about eating something first?

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wang Shen, come.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thank you.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Chopsticks.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Eat more.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Come, vegetables.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You have to eat thick tea and rice.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's fate that we meet each other.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't be polite to us.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, it's very fragrant.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Wang Shen,

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think everyone is busy.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you busy with?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You came just in time

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to catch up with the light village.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
At this time,

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
all the men and women in our village

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
have to go to the river to light the lamps.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As long as you make a wish on the lamps,

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you can get divine power.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
According to the custom,

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
before the light village,

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the husband should draw the eyebrows for the bride

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to ask for the color of the couple and love.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This gentleman brother

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
is very careful.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He must be a good painter.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then I can't be a fool.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wife, you have to teach me well.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I...

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Eat more.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Eat more.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The clouds and the sea are separated.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't guess the mind.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Only the wind can touch the white sand.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let me see.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What are you drawing?

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not drawing.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't move.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Stand there.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Here.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you laughing?

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't move.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When I was at the Changqing Temple last time,

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I didn't have time to ask you

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
why you want to practice Jinshu.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's a long story.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No matter how long it is,

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to hear it.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
When I was a child,

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I had a strange disease.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I couldn't control my soul.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I would lose my mind.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I would even lose my ability.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No!

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't bite your tongue even if you eat it.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You look like a wolf

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
who met me in the war in the border.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Aren't you afraid of me?

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why should I be afraid?

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm your general.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're sick, aren't you?

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Just get well soon.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Listen to me.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I didn't know until later

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that my brother wanted to make me a blood slave.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But I was not good at it.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So every night,

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I would go crazy and want to wake up.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I was not confident.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was afraid that I would become a blood monster.

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Until I found a way to suppress it.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's to practice Jinshu.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I didn't expect

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that this was also part of my brother's plan.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Every night,

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
my brother would use the burning bones to seduce me

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and kill people according to his will.

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But every time I woke up,

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I didn't remember anything.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's okay.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We will face it together in the future.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
