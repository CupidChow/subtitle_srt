1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
I didn't have time to meet you

4
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
at the banquet last time.

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,120
Last time, my aunt

6
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,400
made the Crown Prince angry.

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,800
I have to go now.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
I happened to take this opportunity

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
to apologize to you.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,200
I didn't expect

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
the Crown Prince would

12
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
come to the door and mention it.

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,200
My son

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
is still a young man.

15
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
You always make jokes.

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't take it seriously, Miss Qianye.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know how to joke.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
I take everything seriously.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Then the engagement with Cheng Qi

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
must be true.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,000
I will make a will

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
and grant you to marry him.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm afraid I have to ask the Crown Prince.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Okay.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll take you to ask him now.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
Your Highness, I'll leave now.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
Do you know

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
why I asked you to come here today?

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You want to kill me?

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
You're so smart.

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
You know I want to kill you?

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Of course.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
Even my stepmother knows

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
that the engagement is not working.

36
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
It will only make the Crown Prince more rebellious.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
You can't end it then.

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
So,

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
I want to kill you.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Of course.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Even my stepmother knows

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,000
that the engagement is not working.

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
It will only make the Crown Prince more rebellious.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
There's only one way

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
to make the Crown Prince give up.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll die.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
If you didn't die in the capital,

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
but you were the stepmother of Jian Eying,

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
you would be the Crown Princess.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,200
After all, you're smarter than Xi He.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
If he were smarter,

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
the Xi family

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,400
would have lived longer.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
They wouldn't have to close the door.

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
So,

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,000
the Xi family would have closed the door.

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
The Queen is involved.

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
So what?

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
They're all stupid.

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
You're smart,

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
but

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
you're lowly and ambitious.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
You don't listen to the rules.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
You'll die.

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,600
Although my mother's family is lowly,

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,400
they're very cunning.

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Do you smell the incense?

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Today,

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
you'll die.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
If I die,

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
you may die with me.

72
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
This is...

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,200
This is the Star Formation of Han Xue Shi of Jian Eying.

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,400
This is...

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
This is the Star Formation of Han Xue Shi of Jian Eying.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
You killed Shen Qianye

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
and removed all guards.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
You gave me a chance.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
You died in such a beautiful snow.

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
You deserve it.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
I've treated you well these years.

82
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Treated me well?

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
You just take me as your pawn.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
I met His Majesty with you.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What a pity.

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
His Majesty saw you and Lingnu

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,800
get together.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Otherwise,

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
with your beauty,

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,800
His Majesty may like you first.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
You asked Lingnu to give me the medicine.

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
You're blaming yourself.

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Lingnu gave you the medicine

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
because of Her Highness.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Back then,

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
after you were pregnant,

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,000
I found you a subordinate of the Shen Mansion.

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
If I hadn't helped you,

99
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
how could he be so noble?

100
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
You don't know how grateful you are.

101
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
You...

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,200
You want me to die here?

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
This is the land of immortals.

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,200
You want to kill me and Her Highness here?

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
No.

106
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
You want to kill Her Highness.

107
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
The Anxious Formation?

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I saw Miss Shen and Her Highness in the formation.

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I didn't know what to do.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
After tonight,

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
everyone will think that it's Her Highness

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
who stopped you from marrying the Crown Prince

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
and your beautiful wife, Luo Kong,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
to kill Her Highness in anger.

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Ying.

117
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm so sad.

118
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Today...

119
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Today,

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
it's also...

121
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,800
It's also you who killed the prostitute.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
I'll report to His Majesty

123
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
for you.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I promise you'll be fine.

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Stop it.

126
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
You've been treating me like a dog for so many years.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
You've ruined my reputation

128
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
and ruined our marriage.

129
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
You married me to someone else.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
I won't forgive you for this.

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Today,

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
I'll get all the humiliation back.

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
No.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn't cut you into pieces.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
You're on the side.

136
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
Qianye.

137
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Walk well.

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Although you've made such a big mistake,

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I'll still

140
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,400
punish you.

141
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
You're not poisoned.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
I knew you were going to kill me.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
I was being careful.

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
You've learned to defend yourself long ago.

145
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,600
But with your little power,

146
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
you'll die tonight.

147
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
As expected.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is all your plan.

149
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
They'll kill you.

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
This is all your plan.

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,200
You started the conflict between them.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You shouldn't know this.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you going to kill me?

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes.

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm Shen Qianye.

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Guke Mu Xiang made him lose his mind.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Guke Mu Xiang.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
Pei Su.

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Cheer up.

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
With my power,

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
I can't break this bloodstain.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
Help me.

163
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
I'll send you away.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I'll send you away.

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,000
To enjoy fun.

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,800
buzzer

167
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
Be nervous

168
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Let's go.

169
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,080
I just hope

170
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,360
Your Highness can marry me.

171
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,240
If I return safely,

172
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,400
it will be a hundred years' happiness.

173
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
If you take this sand field,

174
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
I will never marry you.

175
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Xi He!

176
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,920
He!

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,380
She is your second wife.

178
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,980
Don't cry.

179
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:15,520
She can't even

180
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
The Kindest Prince

181
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,040
After the He ring the development?!?!

182
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't understand.

183
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Laziness is a

184
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,760
let many

185
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,140
How do you

186
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,660
feel

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,100
when hearing

188
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
about

189
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
N Sure

190
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
A

191
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,740
oh
