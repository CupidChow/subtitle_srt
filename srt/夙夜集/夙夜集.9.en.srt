00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Swords of Legends II

2
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Episode 24

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your Highness,

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,480
it's useless than I thought.

5
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,720
And you want me to save you.

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
You're more stupid than I thought.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
Your Highness owes me a favor.

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
You must remember it in the future.

9
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
You'd better live first.

10
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,800
Your Highness should be on the way to Gannan.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Have you decided how to lie?

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
The wind has blown.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
You're here at the right time.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Your Highness.

15
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
Your Highness,

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,880
you saw it with your own eyes.

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
You should believe me now.

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,520
You designed it on purpose.

19
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
How could you not know?

20
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
Didn't you say

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
the moon will turn weak?

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Pei Su knew I had some

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,960
false news on purpose.

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,960
He wanted to kill me with your hands.

25
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,920
If I didn't,

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,720
I'd lose my power

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,240
in half an hour.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,040
A'he,

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,240
there's no sign of the return of the concubines.

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Could you...

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
Could you make a bet with me first?

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
It's dangerous.

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm afraid Xi He won't accept

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,920
the good intentions of the Crown Prince.

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
When you come back,

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
I'll go to Xi's Mansion to make a bet.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Is that okay?

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
After All

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
Xi He.

40
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Your Highness, if you still won't believe me,

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
and broke Pei Su's wish

42
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
to kill us.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
Don't think I'll let you go.

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,400
What do you want?

45
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I want

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,200
to have

47
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
the hope

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
that you can marry me.

49
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
If I can come back safely,

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll be happy to see you for a hundred years.

51
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,640
If...

52
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
If you die in the battlefield,

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
I'll never marry you.

54
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,800
Your Highness.

55
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
Did you forget something?

56
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
Xing asked me to go to Lord Cangwu's place

57
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,480
to visit the Crown Prince.

58
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Yes.

59
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,360
As long as Lord Cangwu starts to suspect the Crown Prince,

60
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,800
it's enough.

61
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,720
Your Highness.

62
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Your Highness.

63
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,560
What's up?

64
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,080
Your Highness.

65
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,640
His Highness sent a memorial to the palace

66
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
saying that he was assassinated

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,280
and suspected by the Crown Prince.

68
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
He was seriously injured?

69
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,720
Then,

70
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
do you want to summon the Crown Prince to the palace?

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's not the time yet.

72
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
He's so impatient.

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
Does His Highness mean

74
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,360
the Crown Prince or His Highness?

75
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
They're both impatient.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Your Highness.

77
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
You've been tortured for more than ten years.

78
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Is it possible

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
that it's not a disease?

80
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,080
You mean...

81
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,640
I've been through the bone marrow.

82
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,000
I found that this disease

83
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
is related to bone marrow.

84
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,960
Bone marrow is just a common herb.

85
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,320
It won't harm me.

86
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
Maybe it can't be bone marrow.

87
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,000
But if it's paired with bone marrow,

88
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
it might work.

89
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Bone marrow.

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,240
There's bone marrow in the palace.

91
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,320
Your Highness.

92
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
You mean

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
the Crown Prince is loyal to you?

94
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Of course.

95
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
He only talked to me

96
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,880
for the whole night.

97
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,960
Then he left in a hurry.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,080
Didn't he talk to Shen Qianye?

99
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,240
What do you mean?

100
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
The Crown Prince hates him so much.

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,880
He even said that he was humiliated.

102
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Don't worry.

103
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,440
The position of the Crown Princess is mine.

104
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
Then why did he say that he was humiliated?

105
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,480
It seems that he's a fake.

106
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,680
Fake?

107
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,840
Since he's a fake,

108
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
it means

109
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,560
he cares about the Crown Prince the most.

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,440
Mom.

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Which gold hairpin do you think I should wear?

112
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,360
Maybe you can change it for me.

113
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
You've lost to Shen Qianye.

114
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
What's the point of having the same face?

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,560
Impossible.

116
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,200
The Crown Prince hates him.

117
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
It's not scary.

118
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,760
What's scary is not in his eyes.

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,000
When he left, the Crown Prince disappeared.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
He didn't show up in the middle of the night.

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
You should be more considerate.

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
You should have tried harder.

123
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,680
Did I ask you to harm him?

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,280
I...

125
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,960
How could I have given birth to you?

126
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Mom.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,800
If Shen Qianye really gets the Crown Princess,

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
we won't have a good life.

129
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,400
Don't be afraid.

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,120
I will never let Shen Qianye

131
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,320
get the Crown Princess.

132
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,760
Shen Lang.

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
Shen Lang.

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,360
What?

135
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
What kind of face do you want?

136
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm just a short-sleeved girl.

137
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,800
I only care about wearing clothes.

138
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Clothes.

139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,280
You only see your real face now?

140
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,720
I heard that the Queen has officially started to choose the Crown Princess.

141
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,160
You're a high-ranking official.

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
Our daughter

143
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
will be a high-ranking official too.

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,360
The one who saved the late Ye Qianye last time

145
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,320
caused trouble.

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
This time, it's Di Qianling.

147
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,360
No.

148
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
This time,

149
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,160
it's Di Qianye.

150
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
He's so kind.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,040
There must be something wrong.

152
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,840
Xiao Ying, let me ask you.

153
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,880
Did I have any good friends before?

154
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,000
My Lady, you're right.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
I just gave some benefits to Song Bo

156
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
who received the letters.

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,760
He secretly gave me these letters.

158
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Who wrote these letters?

159
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,960
Why are they all

160
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
your husband?

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,880
It's all wrong.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,520
The knowledge of the Young Master Cheng

163
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,760
is really going to be improved.

164
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,160
Young Master Cheng?

165
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,880
Who?

166
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
My Lady, you forgot?

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,680
He's your husband.

168
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,080
I've even made a betrothal.

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,880
Yes.

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
Young Master Cheng is the son of the Prime Minister.

171
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,080
He has been careful about you

172
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
and made a betrothal long ago.

173
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,680
But when he went to the military camp,

174
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,920
he proposed to cancel the engagement.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,520
My Lady was so upset

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,640
that she didn't eat or drink.

177
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
Chengqi?

178
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,880
You mean...

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,920
Chengqi?

180
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm Chengqi.

181
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Please approve my marriage.

182
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,920
After this trip is over,

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,880
I'll return to my hometown

184
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
to marry my beloved one

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
and get the marriage certificate.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,440
Approved.

187
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,800
Thank you, General.

188
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,920
But

189
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Chengqi can't be such a heartless man.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
There must be something wrong with him.

191
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,000
