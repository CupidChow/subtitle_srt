00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Pei Su.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Pei Su.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Pei Su.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You know everything?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Congratulations.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I...

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid he has a plan to marry me.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I tried to delay it for a while.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So I tried to delay it for a while.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Aren't you disappointed?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I actually quit at this time.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hate makes people strong.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Love makes people slow down.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You fell in love with him.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're right.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have no reason to back down.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I wish you a happy marriage.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't accept your blessing.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't accept your blessing.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is a gift from Uncle Wang for me and Qianye.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm bringing Qianye as apology to Uncle Wang.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You want to anger me?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I dare not.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why did you marry her?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Didn't Uncle Wang want me to marry her too?

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're worth all the talk.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He is just a friend.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They just like him.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,600
He is just a spy sent by my uncle.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
You know you are a trap and you still jump.

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you, Uncle.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
For your letter.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
Send more people to keep an eye on Pei Su.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
He can't be released at once.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why is it you?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why are you following me?

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Crown Prince sent people to follow you.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I am here to report to you.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Since he already knows I am your spy,

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
why don't you act a little more sincere?

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You don't want me to marry them.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The closer we get, the closer we get to get married.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As you wish.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are not afraid that he will marry you?

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It is also a trap for me to marry him.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Be careful.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Have you found evidence that proves Pei Su and the West Gate secret code?

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Still looking.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He is getting more and more cautious.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If there is no evidence, then create evidence.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Understood.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I just said that the wine is not good.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You just don't listen.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is the Emperor's feet.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Every day in the capital, people disappear.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How is that fair?

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And they all disappear near the Prince's mansion.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The Crown Prince wants to say that this is related to me.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why do you turn your back on him?

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is what Uncle Wang said.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't frame you.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Brother Wang, although I am not stupid,

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
if I really want to do it, why should I be around the Prince's mansion?

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Enough.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I called you two here not to let you doubt each other.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The West Gate has been executed.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why are there still people missing?

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the people who disappeared this time

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
are the same as the injuries of the Imperial Guards on the day the West Gate was destroyed.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This person seems to be practicing the forbidden technique.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have been practicing this since I came to the country.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is a big thing.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you find out the real murderer, you will be executed.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am willing to take the order to investigate this case and find the real murderer.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Your Highness, Pei Suo seems to know that we are playing tricks on him.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He hasn't been out of the hospital for days.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He invites those officials in the government every day.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now everyone is his witness.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We can't find any new evidence.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's almost the night of the full moon.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Your Highness, you should take a break.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The only ones who went to the West Gate that day were me and the Crown Prince.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The only ones who could use the forbidden technique were me.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can hardly help but doubt myself.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Even so, you were forced to do so.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
To resist the damage caused by the bones,

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I had to find a way to practice the forbidden technique.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's strange is that the wounds of the people who have disappeared recently

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
were also caused by the forbidden technique.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You mean that someone else can do the forbidden technique?

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought it was the trap set by the Crown Prince

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
to create the same wounds and frame me.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Until I went to the Dali Temple to check the wounds and discovered that it wasn't like that.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So the Crown Prince was just trying to save the opportunity?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He couldn't catch my handle. He must be in a rush right now.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's almost the 15th. He won't miss this opportunity.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Come.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ever since I washed your blood,

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I've gained an uncontrollable power in my body.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's always out of control.

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's all Pei Lang's scheme.

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He had already set up a trap in the manor.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
As long as you leave the manor,

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will be able to get out of here.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will be able to get out of here.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He had already set up a trap in the manor.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
As long as you leave the manor and kill someone out of control,

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will immediately arrest you and take you back.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You ruined his plan. Then he...

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I suspect that he deliberately let me come back.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He still has a backer?

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I can't figure out what kind of medicine he was selling in the alley.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think I'm also part of his plan.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He married me.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It seems that he has already figured out everything.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What did he figure out?

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He figured out my motive.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Little Uncle!

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Shen Qianye is my fiancee.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know why he was kidnapped by His Highness.

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If you don't hand her over,

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will bring someone in.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's go!

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go!

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They are trying to frame you. Don't be fooled.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You betrayed me?

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Your Highness, I didn't mean to hurt you.

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let us go.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Impossible.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I will give you another chance.

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you sure you want to be with him?

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Then I will help you.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
These are the guards of His Majesty.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They are all top-level masters.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They are going to force me to do it today.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, you can't do it.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is the purpose of the training.

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He wants to force you to do it.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Then he will frame evidence to harm you.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will find a way to escape.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You will leave as soon as possible.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't go.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't go.

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm just your knife.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will just kill you.

178
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You are the Seven-Garlic. You can't die.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Bai Su!

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let me go!

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, no!

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Bai Su!

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Bai Su! No!

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Bai Su!

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Bai Su!

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This smoke...

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It killed my father.

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The dust is gone

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yesterday's smoke

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Lonely night

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The ashes are deep

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Waiting for a spring

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
In my heart, I will never die

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The soul is still alive

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The heart is still silent

197
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The sea of ​​sweet flowers

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The years are passing by

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I miss you

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The wind and snow

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The flowers are still blooming

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The wind is still here

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The old memories

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I just want to be with you

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000

207
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Bai Su!

209
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Bai Su!

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bai Su!

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The wind and snow

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The old memories

213
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
