1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,700
the

2
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,180
second

3
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,460
Do not

4
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,620
This is a bit too high.

5
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,020
You can't follow the rules of the Western family.

6
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
After all, the Shen family is a good family.

7
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,060
That's right.

8
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,740
The most talented and the highest class.

9
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,940
Even you think so.

10
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,980
Not to mention others.

11
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,740
I understand.

12
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,660
Your Highness, you want to tell everyone

13
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,660
in the highest class that he is the one you love.

14
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,020
Don't let others underestimate you.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,340
You know, I won't say more.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,980
Anyway, you can't treat him badly.

17
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,340
Your Highness, don't worry.

18
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,980
Give this painting to Shen Qianye.

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,220
You must see him open it yourself.

20
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,260
Yes.

21
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,820
He, my mother just died.

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,900
I can't hold a real wedding.

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,060
I won't invite anyone tomorrow.

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,940
This wedding is only for you and me.

25
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,020
I hope you can forgive me.

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,860
This is what the Crown Prince asked you to give me?

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,660
Yes.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,260
His Highness also asked me

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,860
to show you the painting.

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,780
I wish you a happy 100th day.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,100
Your Highness, I've received the painting.

32
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,500
I love it very much.

33
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,180
Go to sleep.

34
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
Your Highness, leave.

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,060
He won't come.

36
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,980
Why doesn't he believe me?

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,900
There's no reason for him to believe you.

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,300
He has no reason to believe in an enemy.

39
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,180
Sometimes the answer is simple,

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
but you don't want to believe it.

41
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Maybe he has his own reasons.

42
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,180
Prince, let's go.

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,460
Sometimes he hates you,

44
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,460
but it's not a good thing.

45
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
Even if he hates me,

46
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,460
I want to keep him by my side.

47
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Prince, you don't mean to...

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Prince, you don't want to marry the Crown Prince?

49
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Why?

50
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
It's the honor of the whole Shen Mansion

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
to marry the Crown Prince.

52
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
That's what I want to do most.

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
Go and watch the door.

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Yes.

55
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Why are you here?

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Don't you hate me?

57
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
You should have stayed with me

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
and killed me.

59
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Why did you marry the Crown Prince?

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
You're here to die.

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I know.

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
He must have used a trick to get you to find me

63
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
and find out where I am.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I know you didn't come to see me

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
because you hate me.

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
You're protecting me.

67
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Don't think too much. I just hate you.

68
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Yes, he just hates you.

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Go.

70
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
You knew he was Xi He, didn't you?

71
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
You went to the scene

72
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
and used a magic trick

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
on the day the Xi family was killed,

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
didn't you?

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Don't listen to him.

76
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
He's using you as a bait

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
to get to the bottom of it.

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Enough!

79
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
I don't need your advice.

80
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
I have my own judgment.

81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,900
You should mind your own business.

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Tomorrow

83
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
is the day I marry the Crown Prince.

84
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
If you're free,

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
you can come and have a drink.

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
I will.

87
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
I will.

88
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
The night is so bright

89
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
The snow falls

90
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
The love is so strong

91
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
The dust is gone

92
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
The wind is so strong

93
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
The lonely night

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
The memories are so deep

95
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
The spring is here

96
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
The fire in my heart is still burning

97
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
The soul is still here

98
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
The heart is still here

99
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
The flowers bloom

100
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
The yearning is growing

101
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
The heart is still here

102
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
The memory is still here

103
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
The wind is still here

104
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
The flowers are blooming

105
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
The wind is blowing

106
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
The wind feels like

107
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
We're going to be there soon.

108
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,540
The crown prince may be waiting for you.

109
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,580
Hurry up.

110
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,940
Ying, please check my shoes.

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Are my shoes loose?

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,140
Miss, you've said it twice.

113
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
Really?

114
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,340
Are you waiting for him?

115
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,500
Wait, dead body.

116
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,140
How old are you?

117
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,500
Does he want to break the phone?

118
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Xi He.

119
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Your Highness, I'm Shen Qian Yi.

120
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
I want to tell you

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,700
who you are.

122
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,700
I was wrong.

123
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm responsible

124
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,100
for the death of the Xi family.

125
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Hello.

126
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
I won.

127
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,900
You...

128
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Are you home?

129
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Not yet.

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
I want to see you first

131
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,500
and then go back to my father.

132
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
He,

133
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,100
you're tired from the journey.

134
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,100
Why don't you stay at the Crown Prince's mansion tonight

135
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,100
and not go home?

136
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
No.

137
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
They're waiting for me at home.

138
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,500
They set up a feast for me today.

139
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm not going.

140
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,300
They set up a feast for me today.

141
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Besides,

142
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,700
it's not proper to stay at the Crown Prince's mansion.

143
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
I know.

144
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
But...

145
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
All right.

146
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,500
I've seen you before.

147
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
I have to go home first.

148
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
He, I...

149
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,100
What's wrong?

150
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Tell me.

151
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,300
What can't you tell me?

152
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,500
I can't bear to leave you.

153
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,300
I can't bear to leave you either.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,700
But I really have to go home today.

155
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm leaving.

156
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,300
See you tomorrow.

157
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
They're waiting for me.

158
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Be careful!

159
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,700
Be careful on the road!

160
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Go!

161
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Fushan!

162
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Prepare the horse!

163
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Prepare the horse!

164
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
He!

165
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
He!

166
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
He!

167
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
He!

168
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
He!

169
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm sorry, Xinhe.

170
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
I should have told you.

172
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,300
I shouldn't have kept my interests from being destroyed.

173
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,900
I shouldn't have watched you go home.

174
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,500
I shouldn't have stopped you from being brave.

175
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,100
You haven't changed at all.

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,100
In the past, you chose to silence me for power.

177
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Now, you're sacrificing yourself to lure Pei Su out.

178
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
It's not him.

179
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm using you to ensure your safety.

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
No need to explain.

181
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,100
I don't hate you that much.

182
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
Because I don't care.

183
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,300
I hate you only when I care.

184
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,500
Now, I...

185
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,900
I hate Pei Su even more.

186
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Fushan.

187
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,500
If His Majesty knows you've been to the Xi family,

188
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
what will he think of you?

189
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
He'll think of you as a friend.

190
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
If you've been to the Xi family, what will he think of you?

191
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,900
You know he's suspicious.

192
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
You...

193
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
I'll give you only one option.

194
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
You'll help the Xi family to rebel.

195
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
You'll prove that the Xi family was wronged.

196
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
It's Pei Su who destroyed the Xi family.

197
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,900
He's a traitor. He deserves to die!

198
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
So...

199
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,500
So, it's all your plan.

200
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
Let's go, Fushan.

201
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,300
Today is our wedding day.

202
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
present

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Liuoksai

204
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,200
A place where dark clouds cover the bright dragons

205
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,300
A experience where Republic of China isAND

206
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,300
And also trying to worship the east

207
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,280
And discover the septic

208
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,180
A place where people can never go

209
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
across seas

210
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,980
And look for world

211
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,380
The retina

212
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,280
Why?

213
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,100
Because no one knows

214
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,400
Caution

215
00:16:48,400 --> 00:17:15,080
All Lots of descending
