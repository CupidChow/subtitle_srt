00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,280
Kumar encounterslit

2
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Please get up.

4
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
It's you.

5
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
What a coincidence, Uncle.

6
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
I just need someone in my house.

7
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
My nephew asked for you.

8
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Please.

9
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Miss Shen,

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
if you want,

11
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
you can come with me now.

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
I'll send you home.

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
For you.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Look.

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
General Xi He and the Crown Prince

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
are a perfect match.

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Yes.

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
They match so well.

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Why are you standing there?

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I'll just hold it for you.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
There's a new batch of household items in the store.

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
You can pick and choose.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
What do you think?

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Isn't it beautiful?

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll go first.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't worry.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
The neighbors are all your family.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
I'll go first.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
I'll go first.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Don't worry.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
The neighbors are all your family.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
I'll go first.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
Don't worry.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
The neighbors are all your family.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll go first.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Don't worry.

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
The neighbors are all your family.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
The neighbors are all your family.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I'll go first.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
I like it.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Miss Shen,

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
If you don't want to go home,

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,160
you can stay at my place.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,240
I promise you,

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
you will be safe.

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,320
Sorry, Beile.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,800
He has the same mark as the murderer.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
I have to get close to him

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
to find out the murderer.

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

51
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
But Qianye has decided to follow you

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
till death do us part.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll leave now.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
It's the mark of the mansion.

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Your Highness, we've found out the murderer.

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The one who framed you is the murderer.

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I don't need to investigate.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm not the murderer.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
But the one who framed you is the murderer.

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I know you don't need to investigate.

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
But who did it that night?

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Who did it?

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Who did it?

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I don't know.

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
He is very powerful.

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
He knows your magic.

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
He can imitate 70% of your power.

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
It's really strange.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Keep investigating.

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Yes.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Besides, Shen Qianye

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
came here on purpose.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
It's obvious that he has something to do with the Xi family.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
He didn't do anything wrong

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
to Pei Lang.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
It seems that there are more people who believe him.

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Your Highness, you have to be careful.

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I have so many enemies.

80
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I need to find one.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Yes.

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Keep this well.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't let Shen Qianye find it.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Yes.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Ignore him.

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Pei Lang.

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
No.

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Pei Lang, you are the murderer.

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
The Crown Prince's Mansion is empty tonight.

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Liu!

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Lan, Lan, Lan.

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
You go first.

93
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Come, come, come.

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I have something to tell you.

95
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Come, come, come.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Liu,

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I think

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
His Highness must be very careful

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
in the case of destroying the General's Mansion.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
You know,

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
His Highness must be very careful in the case of destroying the General's Mansion.

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
If you had not been so successful

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
in the case of the ambush,

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
how could it be so smooth?

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
No.

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I heard that

107
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
His Highness used the lives of all the people in the West Mansion

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
to make a great contribution to His Majesty.

109
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I feel sorry for General Xi He.

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I didn't expect His Highness to be so cruel.

111
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
How can we understand

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
such a big deal?

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Thanks to General Xi He,

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
His Highness saved his life.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I heard that

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Her Highness has already decided

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
to choose the Crown Princess

118
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
in the name of the birthday banquet.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
After the ceremony,

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
she will choose the Crown Princess again.

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Who?

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Who?

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Hurry up.

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Ocean Sugar Flower.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Isn't this General Xi He's tombstone?

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Ocean Sugar Flower.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I will report to His Highness.

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Hurry up.

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Come in.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
How is it?

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Have you found the answer you want?

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
You let me know on purpose.

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
The wrong person has the right to decide.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Since you are taking revenge for someone,

135
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
you shouldn't have found the wrong enemy.

136
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You still know how to play tricks on me.

137
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I know how to play tricks on you.

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I know how to play tricks on you.

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I know how to play tricks on you.

140
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I know how to play tricks on you.

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I know how to play tricks on you.

142
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
What else do you know?

143
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
I also know

144
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
that you are not Shen Qian Yi.

145
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
A weak woman who has lived a long life

146
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
will appear at the scene of the Xi family's super family.

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Now she is climbing on my bed.

148
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
It's hard not to suspect

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
who you are.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Who am I?

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
It doesn't matter.

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
His Highness also said

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
that I am just a person who takes revenge.

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I will give you a chance

155
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
to take revenge.

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Don't be anxious, Your Highness.

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Who is my enemy?

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I can't tell you now.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
What do you mean?

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
You put so much effort

161
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
to let me discover all this.

162
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
What if it's a trap?

163
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I can kill you now.

164
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Do you want to do it?

165
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I don't want to do it.

166
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't want to do it.

167
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Be careful.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
It's all your fault.

169
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Come here.

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
How is it?

171
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm scared.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Don't be afraid.

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
The man who used to marry me

174
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
is actually a man with a sword

175
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
who killed my whole family.

176
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Come on.

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
There is a trap.

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Who is it?

179
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Hurry up.

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You used me again.

181
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
I just left a

182
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
peach blossom that looks like

183
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
the same as General Yu Xi.

184
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But he killed it with his own hands.

185
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
It seems that

186
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
he is still afraid that he is not dead.

187
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Come out.

188
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Thank you for your help.

189
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I have one more thing

190
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
to ask you for help.

191
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Help me marry Yu Pei Lang.

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Give me a reason.

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Once the crown prince dies,

194
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
you can take over the court.

195
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
You mean

196
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I can't sit in that position

197
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
and be the queen?

198
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I dare not.

199
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
But there is one thing

200
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
that only I can do.

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
What?

202
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
To treat your illness.

203
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
What illness?

204
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
You helped me the other day.

205
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Actually, I helped you, right?

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
That day was the night of the full moon.

207
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
There is often a full moon

208
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
when the seasons of Cangwu Kingdom change.

209
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
These days, your life is not good.

210
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Today is also a full moon.

211
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
It's the time

212
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
when you need me.

213
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I said

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
I don't like smart people.

215
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Do you want to

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
take it back?

217
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Why do I have to marry him?

218
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I have my own reason.

219
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
What?

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Shen Qianye

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
would rather be my antidote

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
than be my blood.

223
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I want to be his wife.

224
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
