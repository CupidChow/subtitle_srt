1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
father

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're finally back, Qi.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Father, you promised me that

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
as long as I return safely,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you'll marry Qianye.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You bastard!

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Shen Family has already signed the Iron Law

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and is going to select the Crown Princess.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're still going to work?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where will we lose our honor?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Honor?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where is the importance of Qianye?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You...

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Father, we lost our honor.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We'll just get back the honor.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I can't marry Qianye,

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'd rather die in battle.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is there only one woman in the world?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't marry her.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Left Chamber of Commerce has been established.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Please marry the Shen Family's legitimate daughter, Shen Qianye.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please inform us.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Isn't the legitimate daughter of the Shen Family

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the one who just signed the Iron Law and is going to select the Crown Princess?

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It seems that she has already made a marriage contract with the Yihe family.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She has a marriage contract in advance,

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but she's not going to break it for Pang Gaozhi.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The marriage of a woman and a man is a matter of course.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's a common thing.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right. How can there be such a person?

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What kind of person?

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Left Chamber of Commerce has been established.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please marry the legitimate daughter of the Shen Family, Shen Qianye.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Please inform us.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mrs. Shen.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm back.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Crown Prince has arrived.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The Crown Prince has arrived.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just received the iron change from the Shen Family last night.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was rude to you.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I couldn't persuade her.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Qianye was also confused for a moment.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's why she made such a mistake.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's going on?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get Shen Qianye out.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I...

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's her.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's her.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your Highness the Left Chamber of Commerce.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm back.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The Crown Prince has arrived.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Crown Prince has arrived.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The Crown Prince has arrived.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The rightful daughter of the Shen Family, Shen Qianye.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What do you want?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What if I don't help?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sure that tomorrow,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Pei Lang will be my husband.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The iron change has been sent out.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a death sentence to hide the marriage.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I have to attend the wedding tomorrow.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's such a lively event.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Aren't you curious how I'll make it?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't admit that you're married.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You admit that you're married.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm a little curious.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you dying for the sake of the reputation?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Or for deceiving the Crown Prince?

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have a long life.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can marry me tomorrow.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Help me.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a wedding.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you for your kindness.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're putting yourself on fire.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're putting yourself on fire.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're not afraid of burning yourself.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can be reborn when I'm on fire.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not afraid of suicide.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Do you know

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the world's evaluation of women

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is that one's heart is the needle

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and two are the fire.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The heart of the heart is the heart of the moon.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The world's reputation

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
is a legend.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're married.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you hiding it on purpose?

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Qianyue, don't be afraid.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Tell me.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you get forced?

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's hiding about the engagement.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're committing a crime of death!

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He dared to admit it straight away.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's sure to be noticed

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
by the Crown Prince's son and the Crown Prince's son-in-law.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's sure to be noticed by the Crown Prince's son-in-law.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not a mortal if I can see the crown prince at the same time.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's okay, Qianye. I'm back. Trust me.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Qianye, when the government admits his crime,

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the government will hide the marriage and make a change.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me join the selection of the crown princess.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I... I don't know.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Chengqi, didn't you come back early to cancel the marriage?

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Impossible. I'm waiting for my return in the military camp.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just want to go home early and marry my sister.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And you wrote the letter to make me come back early.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Qianye, Qianye, explain it.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know. I've never received a letter from Chengqi.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
For so many years, I thought she was suggesting that Siqian forgot me.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't expect that it was so coincidental.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was selecting the crown princess at the same time.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She suddenly came back.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Where is my letter?

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It must be a trick.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She wants to kill us.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who is this little girl?

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think she wants to frame us.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And she wants to mess up the selection of the crown princess.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is this all arranged by Mrs. Shen?

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think so.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I... I don't know.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Speaking of messing up the selection of the crown princess,

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know that you want to select the crown princess.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why do you want to marry her?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I once had a wild cat.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you remember it?

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What wild cat?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That wild cat bit me and then disappeared.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am very sorry for the person who assassinated me and betrayed me.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Of course I have to go home and treat her well.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Isn't it?

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What is this?

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What is this?

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Stop fighting.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Stop fighting.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Qian Yi, don't let them fight.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
One is the crown prince, one is the prince.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And one is the prince.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is really annoying.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mother, why do you say that?

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't let them fight.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Besides, did you call Cheng Qi here?

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Isn't this what you want to see?

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Qian Yi, our father and father-in-law are all the same.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Aren't you afraid that they will get hurt?

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It has nothing to do with me.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't let them fight.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If you have any requests, please ask.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then I will return all the pain I suffered to you.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop fighting.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Stop fighting.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The crown prince doesn't have to fight for Qian Yi.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Qian Yi has decided to marry the prince.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
From now on, the prince will be the one to decide.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Qian Yi, you can't do this.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She is my woman.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Where did you get your marriage?

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just go back.

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I will go back.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Shen Qian Yi.

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mother, how can you let her humiliate me like this?

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Qian Yi.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Mother.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I thought you were going to kill me.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But you didn't.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I thought you were really sorry.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But I was wrong.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If that's the case,

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I won't bother you if something like this happens again.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Mother.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
She is really sorry.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's good.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If that's the case,

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
then let's add another hour.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's empty.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Xiao Mei.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Xiao Mei.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Since she fell into the water,

202
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
her personality has changed a lot.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't think she has changed.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
She used to pretend to be pitiful.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now she has shown her true self.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No matter what,

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
she can't live.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We once had a female liked to go to the pool.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I only behaved back a little.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was a secret.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How could you...

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
As we were spending so much time together,

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I had decided to visit her and see if she could come out.

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Direction, please.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
