00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
General Xi Ke!

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
General Xi Ke has come to save us!

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
General Xi Ke has come to save us!

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tonight, if the Pei Dauwa is opened,

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will also be the Great Sheng Fei of General Xi Ke!

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
General Fu Shuai!

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
General Fu Shuai!

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mother!

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Father!

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mother!

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Father!

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Father!

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait for me!

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Father!

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you insist, I will take you to the hospital!

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hurry up!

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I won't go!

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will take you away!

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Father!

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Father!

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Father!

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who is it?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't see his face.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's the Eye of the Deceased.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Father!

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Who are you?

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Father!

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Father!

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Father!

32
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Pei Dauwa...

33
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's my soul fragments.

34
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Father!

35
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Father!

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Father!

37
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Father!

38
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Father!

39
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Father!

40
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,100
Who are you?

41
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,280
Who DXHHH counted?

42
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,800
I played fungus,

43
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I played heist,

44
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,620
then I'm Xiang

45
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,280
I played heist,

46
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I changed my clothes and came back to life.

47
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Second Young Mistress!

48
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Second Young Mistress, you're finally awake!

49
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Second Young Mistress, you can't endure it anymore.

50
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
You must tell the master

51
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
that it was the First Young Mistress who made you fall asleep.

52
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
You bitch!

53
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
How dare you kick my tongue behind my back!

54
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
This woman's eyes are like purple sugar.

55
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,280
She is the daughter of the most powerful and powerful woman in the whole of the Shen Family.

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
She's known to be a very self-conceited person.

57
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
She's known to be a violent and self-destructive person.

58
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Stop!

59
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
This body's soul hasn't woken up yet.

60
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Second Young Mistress!

61
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
I must have died because of her.

62
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
You go away for now.

63
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Shen Qianye,

64
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
with your soul that hasn't woken up for more than 20 years,

65
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
you still want to hit me?

66
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Today, I'll teach you what it means to respect your elders and sisters.

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I...

68
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
My spiritual power isn't as good as yours now,

69
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
but I'm much more ruthless than you.

70
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,280
If I want to make your beautiful face be scratched,

71
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
disappear.

72
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll make you suffer a lot.

73
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Young Mistress!

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Where are you going?

75
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
The Western Manor.

76
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
The Western Manor is going to be a super house today.

77
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Don't go to the party first.

78
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
You offended the First Young Mistress just now.

79
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Super house?

80
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Why?

81
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm trying to rebel.

82
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
This is why I brought along the old and young of the Xi family to commit suicide.

83
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Even the General Xi He who just returned from the battlefield

84
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
died at the hands of the old and young General Xi.

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Committing suicide for a crime?

86
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Rebellion is a crime against the Zhu family.

87
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Even General Xi He as the Crown Princess is no exception.

88
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I heard that the Crown Prince was teary-eyed for the Crown Princess

89
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
and was even accused by some officials.

90
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Hurry up!

91
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Move it over here.

92
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
But today,

93
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,280
the two loyal officials who were always on the lookout in our Xi Manor

94
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,280
became the biggest traitors and criminals.

95
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Hurry up!

96
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
This way!

97
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay!

98
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Your Highness.

99
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Brother, go check the backyard.

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
The seventh item.

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
The Crown Princess's wedding dress.

102
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Check it carefully.

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
When I think about it,

104
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,280
the relationship between the Crown Prince and General Xi He was so close.

105
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
It's so enviable.

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
But now...

107
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
It's so pitiful.

108
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Yes.

109
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Your Highness,

110
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Your Highness,

111
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
don't delay it.

112
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Why is he here?

113
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Where did he come from?

114
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
This wedding dress is really a feast.

115
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
If it's for the new dancer of Zhao Mu Luo,

116
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
she will definitely be able to feast on the crowd.

117
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Why is he here?

118
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Why is he here?

119
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Uncle,

120
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
this is Xi He's wedding dress.

121
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
He can't tolerate a thief like you.

122
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Whoever steals the money is a thief.

123
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,280
The wedding dress is also the Crown Prince's.

124
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Where did the little mouse come from?

125
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Your Highness.

126
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Your Highness.

127
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Your Highness.

128
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Your Highness.

129
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Your Highness.

130
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Your Highness.

131
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Your Highness.

132
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Your Highness.

133
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Your Highness.

134
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Your Highness.

135
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Your Highness.

136
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Your Highness.

137
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Your Highness.

138
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Your Highness.

139
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Your Highness.

140
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Your Highness.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Your Highness.

142
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Your Highness.

143
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Your Highness.

144
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Your Highness.

145
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Your Highness.

146
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Your Highness.

147
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Your Highness.

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Your Highness.

149
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Your Highness.

150
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Your Highness.

151
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Your Highness.

152
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Your Highness.

153
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Your Highness.

154
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Your Highness.

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Your Highness.

156
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Your Highness.

157
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
My wife흒

158
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Tera,

159
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,660
what are you doing?

160
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
A several years later

161
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
a man from the Central Plain

162
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
creates a family

163
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,680
and decides to have theiyu wedding

164
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,620
требated his

165
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,660
for sensations of love,

166
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,300
then pees into his

167
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,280
對啊,

168
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,380
money,

169
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,540
breath,

170
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
and goes to the betrothal.

171
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,280
Anyhow,

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
I think if you're still alive,

173
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,720
you wouldn't want to see Prince Pei Su

174
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,040
treat Jiayi like that.

175
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
That's why I made this move.

176
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
Yi Xi He

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
is really like that.

178
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,080
Please get up, Miss.

179
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
I didn't mean to.

180
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
I'll just take a break.

181
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,220
All right.

182
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Okay.

183
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,220
I'm leaving.

184
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
largely

185
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,960
without making a proper escape.

186
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,880
I have to find out

187
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,480
who the hell

188
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
saw to all the troubles in my family.

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
situation attitude

190
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,260
Is вниз

191
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,360
Are you alright, second lady?

192
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm back.

193
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,360
I heard that you made a lot of noise in the Western Manor

194
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
and made His Highness angry.

195
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Are you going to rebel?

196
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
I advise you not to make a scene now.

197
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Where did you get the courage to say that?

198
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
It's not that the whole Crown Princess Consort's family has just died.

199
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
The entire capital is in a panic.

200
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I don't want to cause trouble to the Shen Manor.

201
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Otherwise, I would have beaten you to death.

202
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Get lost!

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm not going to let you go.

204
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
I'll beat you to death.

205
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Get lost!

206
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
You, you get lost too.

207
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
You get lost too!

208
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Your Highness.
