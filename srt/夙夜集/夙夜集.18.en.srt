1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,160
garnish or serve

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
пеп┤ mistakenly

3
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
a

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
all

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're here.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So what's the other secret

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
of the Goddess of Eternal Green?

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
The ancient book.

10
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Ancient book?

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
What did you write?

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
The forbidden book.

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,300
The one who practices the book will be able to

14
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,000
see the ancient book in person.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
You can see who else

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
practices the forbidden book except me.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The ancient book.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you disabled?

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,000
Someone destroyed the ancient book.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
The purpose is to hide his identity.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Not only did the Xi family disappear,

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
the people who disappeared recently

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
are also related to him.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,600
We...

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Uncle.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How are you, Uncle?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
I asked him to come.

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Your Highness,

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
there's a sea-bream in front of us.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go after him!

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Someone!

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Take down this traitor!

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Pei Su.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will never

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
trust you again.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This knife

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is for you.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It belongs to the Xi family.

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I never thought that one day,

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I would see Uncle

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in such a mess again.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If Your Highness

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
died in my hands,

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
wouldn't that be a pity?

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What exactly do you want?

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to see

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the dead people

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
who are in my hands.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you want?

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thanks to you,

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
he can come back to me.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But what you did to the Xi family...

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
At least,

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
he and I will have a future.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I...

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
have nothing.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Your Highness,

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the Crown Princess

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
didn't have dinner today.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
she must have missed her family

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and was too worried.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She must have hated

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
those traitors.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where can you find

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
the hatred?

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But no matter what,

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
she is my Crown Princess.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's wrong?

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you satisfied

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with the rouge powder

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I prepared for you?

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's what my parents

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
often imagined

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
when I,

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
a general who fights in all directions,

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
would look like.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's beautiful.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But they can't see it anymore.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Everything will pass.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give me some more time.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Everything will pass.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No matter how long it takes,

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will be with you.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A'Long,

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm a little tired.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to be alone for a while.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I won't bother you then.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Have a good rest.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It is possible that

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will write the list of the cultivators

95
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The sword book Pei Su said is true

96
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why do I have symptoms of poisoning

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It can't be

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your Highness

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The corpses are ready

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have forged the wounds

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Whoever sees it

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
These people are all dead

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Tonight someone will accidentally dig out these corpses

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And coincidentally recognize

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They are all from the royal family

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Very good

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Your Highness

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tomorrow in court

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Pei Su will die

110
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Congratulations Your Highness

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Congratulations Your Highness

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Dear ministers

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is there any misunderstanding

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Your Majesty, someone was murdered

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And he is from the royal family

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He must have something to do with the prince

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The evidence is clear, what misunderstanding can there be

118
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But Your Majesty

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He uses the forbidden technique

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How can such a big traitor

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How can he live in this world

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The reputation of the Dianwu dynasty

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Pei Su is my brother

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He has the same bloodline as me

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Now the crime is not decided

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How can you be humiliated

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Father

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I am a junior

130
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I shouldn't have treated my uncle

131
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But last night

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I received a witness

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That witness is an ordinary citizen

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Afraid of trouble

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I had to find my son to help

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What witness

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Father please look

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Phoenix painting token

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This must be the prince's

140
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The evidence is clear, Your Majesty

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Your Majesty, if you don't punish him

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You will lose your conscience

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please kill the murderer

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Tell the world

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The truth has come to this

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Just do as you said

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Your Majesty

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Tell me

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What poison did Pei Su give me

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Where is the antidote

151
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
General Xihe

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The prince will never harm you

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He will only save you

154
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You say it clearly

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Say

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
General Xihe

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have half the prince's blood in your body

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
After the general died

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The prince died

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
After the general died

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The prince learned from ancient books

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
His own skills can protect your soul

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He risked his life to save you

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To save you from danger

165
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Just to get you some survival

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No wonder I can be reborn

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Except for the prince, only I know this

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
General

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You have prince's blood in your body

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's easy to lose

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now your health is bad

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm afraid the prince is about to die

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Find the secret treasure

174
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Tomorrow is going to kill the prince

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The dust is gone

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yesterday was a long night

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Lonely night

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The ashes are deep

179
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Waiting for a spring

180
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In the heart, the fire will never go out

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The soul is still alive

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The heart is silent

183
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The heart is silent

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The sea is sweet

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The flowers are blooming

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The soul is back

187
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The heart is silent

188
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The heart is silent

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The heart is silent

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The heart is silent

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The heart is silent

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The heart is silent

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The heart is silent

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The heart is silent

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The heart is silent

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The heart is silent

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The heart is silent
