00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The End

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 35

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Stop.

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Have you seen this person?

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Have you seen this person?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You, come here.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Have you seen this person?

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's go.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You, do you know this person?

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He may not be looking for us.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The more people don't have a wind to blow,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the more we have to be cautious.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you going to do?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will go back to the God's residence.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The God's residence is heavily occupied,

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and there are many ways to collude.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There must be some evidence in the residence

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that can help us to bring the King of Cangwu down.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You...

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will go back to the residence first.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will think about it.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The God's residence

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did I not see it clearly?

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Highness,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it is a counter-message to bring the King back to the residence

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a counter-message.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Since you have borrowed the God's residence,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you will return it.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your Highness,

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
do you regret it?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Never.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is the most correct decision I have ever made.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am not afraid of death.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But before I die,

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have one more important thing to do.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We are just a test.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will help you to get rid of your grudge.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xi He,

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
things are not as they seem.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You gave me a pear.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I planted it here.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now the pear tree is in full bloom.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But you,

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
are no longer the general who is so generous.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I often think

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if it is worth it to exchange half of my life for yours.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will not let you do that.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will not let you do that.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will not let you do that.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will not let you do that.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will not let you do that.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will not let you do that.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will not let you do that.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will not let you do that.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will not let you do that.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will not let you do that.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Xi He and Shen Qianye are two people.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They are not as good as you.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
there is no such thing as regret.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Shen Lang.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Shen Lang.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Shen Lang.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shen Lang.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you still remember?

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is your favorite perfume.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Shen Lang.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A couple who love each other for a hundred years.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Since you are not here to see me.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then I will teach you how to kill the fish.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Get out of here.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Stop it.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't forget.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I know your trick.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know your trick.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The water is boiling.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The water is boiling.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Someone come.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Someone come.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Master.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Master.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Master.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Master.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Bad news.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The lady is in the dungeon.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Be quiet.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you want everyone to know that

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Shen Qian locked the lady in the dungeon?

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Water is boiling.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What happened to her?

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The fire is too fierce.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The lady can't escape.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She has been burned to the ground.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She can't escape.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She has been burned to the ground.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is this someone's trick to lure the tiger away?

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Master.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The lady is in the dungeon.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Look.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Find a jar and put it in the Shen family's tomb.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So that no one will talk nonsense.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Jian Ling.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We are finally husband and wife.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have treated you badly.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Thank you for what?

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you hadn't told me the secret of the Shen family,

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
things wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I didn't expect that

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
she was afraid of the smell of the night incense.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My mother's tomb,

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
since my mother died,

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
she never smelled the night incense again.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She could only get in by the special incense.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm so guilty.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I really can't find a reason.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't have to thank me.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't want to help you.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I just want to help myself.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
From now on,

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
there will be no Shen Qian in the world.

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jiang Huo is gone.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The Shen family

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
kidnapped innocent people and sent them to the palace.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There is only one person who dares to

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
practice the forbidden arts and transport the slaves.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Of course it's my good brother,

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
King Cang Wu.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm afraid that fake list won't last long.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We have to act as soon as possible,

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
in case of more night dreams.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The best opportunity is ahead.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You mean...

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
tomorrow's ceremony?

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Go and do it.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
After this is over,

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have something to tell you.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't ever try to escape.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I promise you.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Pansu.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
See you tomorrow.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The End

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have made up my mind.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Everything will go according to plan.

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's fate.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's over.

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty,

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
you are the true master of Cang Wu.

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
With a wise king like you,

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't believe I'm Cang Wu.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Look at the sun and the moon.

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a good sign.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
After this ceremony,

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I will rule Cang Wu forever.

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I made the right decision.

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The truth is,

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
only I am the real king of Cang Wu.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Welcome, Your Majesty.

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Welcome, Your Majesty.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The auspicious time has come.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The ceremony begins.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The Sun

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When the sun shines on the Sun,

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will have the power of nature.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Should have washed it all down to one word!

177
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,320
Hold back my tears.

178
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
I can't feel my heart!

179
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,280
Wait for me, armedline estrutah.

180
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,780
여러분,

181
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
Do it.

182
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,920
Give it to me.

183
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,680
I'll make it.

184
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,520
Hurry, hurry.

185
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
Paladin,

186
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm coming!

187
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,980
Ha dig!

188
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,480
Where?

189
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,840
Born this so late,

190
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,240
do you need to garnish it?

191
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,560
Why did you stop

192
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,040

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,200
I will never see you again

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,500
