1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wait in Beijing

2
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Episode 4

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,760
Let's go.

4
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,080
I didn't expect to see you again.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,760
What is she?

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
How could she be the Crown Prince's concubine?

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Exactly.

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,520
She is so shameless.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,480
How could she be so shameless?

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,640
Thanks to you,

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,960
I can stand here.

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
It seems that I'm lucky

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,200
to see you every time.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,960
Coincidentally,

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
I have good news to tell you.

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
From now on,

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
you are free.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
You don't need to be afraid of anyone.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
It's...

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,560
Because...

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
Tonight,

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,440
I will die a terrible death.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
I'll go first.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
See you later.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Tonight is the full moon night.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,480
Pei Su...

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
The full moon night.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,880
Immortal,

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,720
if you dare to step out of the palace gate,

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,040
I will help you and the one who is about to die

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,480
reunite under the nine springs.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
Pei Su,

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,320
I won't save you.

36
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
Waiting for the other person to reunite

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,240
is useless.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
You'd better not.

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
It's really good.

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
That's right.

41
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
I'd better go find him.

42
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,880
What?

43
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,440
Aren't you curious

44
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
why I'm here?

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,360
Since you want to know,

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
I'll tell you.

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
I will tell you

48
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
what I want to do.

49
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
My mother and Her Highness

50
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
are planning to open a school in the same school.

51
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
I can come to a full moon night

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,560
as I want.

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,560
Your...

54
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,840
No wonder I heard

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,360
your mother knelt outside the palace gate last night

56
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,640
to help you get the title.

57
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Why are you laughing?

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,440
A lowly woman like you

59
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,320
doesn't deserve to see Her Highness.

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,680
Lowly?

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,440
Sister,

62
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,640
you're scolding me.

63
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,160
I...

64
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,280
You...

65
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Sister, don't doubt her.

66
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
We are lowly too.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
You're so unreasonable.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,320
You...

69
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,400
It's so hard to see.

70
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
It's so hard to see.

71
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,160
She's so vulgar.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,400
She's so fair.

73
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,280
That's right.

74
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Your Highness,

75
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,920
all the gifts have been delivered.

76
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
This is the South Sea Pearl from the Yun family.

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,920
What?

78
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,120
You want to run away when you send the gift?

79
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,480
I know your gifts

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,760
are not good enough.

81
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,320
You'll be a disgrace to our family if you send it out.

82
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Don't say that I don't think of you.

83
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,960
Take it.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
Hey, don't be so rude.

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,480
This is the Golden Horse Head Buddha statue

86
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
that my mother chose.

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,160
Her Highness likes the clothes.

88
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,400
She will definitely like it.

89
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,880
Okay?

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you know

91
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,960
what's more horrible than a bad person?

92
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,560
What?

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,040
A messenger.

94
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,520
Who are you talking about?

95
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
The Buddha has appeared.

96
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Help!

97
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,200
What's going on?

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,960
Help!

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Why are you crying?

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
What's going on?

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
Help!

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What's going on?

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
You're hurting me.

104
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Shen Qianli is so cruel.

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
What's going on?

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Get up.

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,120
Let me see.

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Shen Qianli,

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
if I were you,

110
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,080
I would try to harm myself.

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
I'd better let the Queen drive me away.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,880
I'd better not be like you.

113
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
Everyone is concerned about you.

114
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,880
No one cares about you.

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
My goodness.

116
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
You scared me.

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Be careful.

118
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Let go of me.

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,000
You...

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
Sorry, everyone.

121
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,840
I've found my pet.

122
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll find it.

123
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
It's okay, little guy.

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Be good.

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,400
The Shen Family is really good at teaching people.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
They teach people like this.

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Exactly.

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
You like this?

129
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,600
Can't I?

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Other women like flowers and flowers.

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,720
But you

132
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
prefer these strange things.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,720
What's wrong?

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Can't I?

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Why not?

136
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,120
The Crown Princess of Cangwu

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,800
should be the most special

138
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,920
Qin woman in the world.

139
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
Do you like it?

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
I like everything

141
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
that A'he likes.

142
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
Why are you standing so far away?

143
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Because...

144
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Don't be so polite.

145
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Let me introduce him to you.

146
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
He...

147
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
He is new to my house.

148
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
His name is Yu.

149
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Calm down.

150
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
He is really cute.

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
A'he.

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Look at him.

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I like everything you like.

154
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Look at him.

155
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
He is A'he.

156
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Let me do it myself.

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
You...

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I don't want to.

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Try it.

160
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm warning you.

161
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Don't be a fool.

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Don't be a filial son

163
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
and try to get my attention.

164
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
You don't deserve to be like Xie He.

165
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
I just have the same hobby

166
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
as General Xie He.

167
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I didn't do it on purpose.

168
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I just want to let His Highness contact me

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
and save my life.

170
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Are you okay?

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I'm fine.

172
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
He likes this kind of girl.

173
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I didn't expect...

174
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
What should we do?

175
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
What about us?

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Take Miss Shen to deal with it.

177
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Shen Qianye,

178
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
you are not the only one

179
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
who wants to be the Crown Princess.

180
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Why should I

181
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
put my attention on a concubine?

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You are just

183
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
humiliating yourself.

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Get lost.

185
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Go.

186
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Go.

187
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Go.

188
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
What's wrong?

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Are you not going to wake up?

190
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I can't hold on for long.

191
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
But I think

192
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
you need me.

193
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Go.

194
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Your Highness.

195
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
