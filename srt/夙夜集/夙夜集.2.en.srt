1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
%ah

2
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:20,440
a

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hurry up.

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The medicine is ready.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Take him away.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mr. Huang, why are you so late?

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We've been waiting for you.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Miss.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't worry.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't kill him.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When I find someone to catch him,

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
he must be alive.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't worry.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're all here.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't you worry?

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We'll make sure he's safe.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You'd better keep your word.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If anything goes wrong,

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you won't get a penny.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Understand?

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll leave my sister to you.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll do my best.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss Chen, take care.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miss Chen, take care.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is there such a good thing in this world?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Little girl, I'm coming.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm coming.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm coming.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm coming.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where is he?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There he is.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Stop.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't run.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Stop.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't let him run away.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Move.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't run.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Move.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't run.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's the most beloved brother of His Majesty.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Move away.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is it me who smells him?

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're all useless.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Miss Chen,

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is your sister really here to get married?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Father, you don't know.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That damn Shen Qianye

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
always comes out to fight with wild men.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She's famous in our Shen Mansion.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Today,

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I must show you her true face.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Guards.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Even if it's the third time,

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we must find Shen Qianye.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Shen Qianye?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Her blood can suppress my poison.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She's useful to me.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You know me?

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I also know you're the daughter of the enemy

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
who is not favored by the Shen Mansion.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Today,

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I almost got killed by your sister

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
who was out of the mansion.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not your fault.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You two,

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
go over there and check.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Father, what are you doing?

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Listen.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They're looking for you.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If I throw you out

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and give it to them now,

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
do you think they'll kill you?

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you looking at?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Get out.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't let them pass.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Be careful.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It seems that she needs my blood.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Did you find her over there?

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go over there.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your Highness.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qianye is under your control.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just hope that Your Highness

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
can save Qianye.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll go over there.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Go.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Go.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Go.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Go.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Go.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can save Qianye.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You look so weak.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,820
Unlike the

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Out!

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Hurry up.

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,420
Hurry up.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Hurry up, hurry.

155
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,440
This is the mark of the second queen that night.

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Man Man Zhi of Mi Wu family is her.

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Second Miss, they are here. Let's go back.

158
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
It's okay. I'm here to wait for her.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Second Miss, that day the second queen ran into the prince in the tomb.

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
She was punished by the master for three days.

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Now that the time has come, she can't wait to come.

162
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
She obviously hates you.

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
And this big disease is really not good.

164
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Second Miss.

165
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Shen Qianye.

166
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
You are a bitch without a soul.

167
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Shen Qianye, are you crazy?

168
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
What are you doing?

169
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I hit you.

170
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm a clever and insolent.

171
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Shen Qianye.

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I hit you.

173
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I hit the brothel.

174
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Shameless.

175
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I hit you.

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Stop hitting.

177
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
You are a strong and weak spirit.

178
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
You bully the good and the bad.

179
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
First Miss.

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll kill you.

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Miss.

182
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
You are really stupid.

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
First Miss.

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
You can't do this in the mansion.

185
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
First Miss.

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Please forgive me.

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Sister.

188
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Qianye gave you so many chances to kill me.

189
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
You can't do this.

190
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
You always put yourself in it.

191
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
This time it won't be the same.

192
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Bitch.

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
You go to die.

194
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
First Miss.

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
First Miss.

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
You can't do this.

197
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Look.

198
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Everyone knows.

199
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
There is a dignity between the enemy and the tree.

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
When you die, I'll be the enemy.

201
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
First Miss.

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Your Highness.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
You dare to kill my people.

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Please don't be angry.

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
We are sisters.

206
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
We are just playing.

207
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
You are indeed a ghost in me.

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Believe me.

209
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
You can come to save me anytime.

210
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Your Highness.

211
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Please don't be angry.

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Please don't be angry.

213
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Shut up.

214
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
You are really not a ghost.

215
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Miss.

216
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
You.

217
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Miss.

218
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
What about the king?

219
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
It's interesting.

220
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Miss, you can't say that.

221
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
If that bitch

222
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
does something to the fox sister.

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
And becomes the queen.

224
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
This...

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You are right.

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I have to go find my father.

227
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
And get her back.

228
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
And put her in my own hands.

229
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Shen Qianye.

230
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
You want to marry better than me.

231
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Go to dream.

232
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Go.

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
You are so bold.

234
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
How dare you.

235
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
You even dare to trick me.

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't understand

237
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
what you are saying.

238
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I don't understand.

239
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
You are really a ghost.

240
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
You are not a ghost.

241
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
You are not a ghost.

242
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
You are a ghost.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
You are a ghost.

244
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
I don't understand.

245
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
You are angry at Shen Qianling.

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
You want her to kill you.

247
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
You want to see

248
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
if I will save you.

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
If you go.

250
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
You can get rid of the Shen family.

251
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
If you don't go.

252
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
It means that

253
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
you are not important to me.

254
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
You can be a good wife.

255
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
And you deserve it.

256
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
You are a ghost.

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
You are a ghost.

258
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
You are a ghost.

259
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
You are a ghost.

260
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You are a ghost.

261
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
You are a ghost.

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
You are a ghost.

263
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
You are a ghost.

264
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
You are a ghost.

265
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
You are a ghost.

266
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
You are a ghost.

267
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
You are a ghost.

268
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
You are a ghost.

269
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
You are a ghost.

270
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
rain

271
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,900
It is a 엄청

272
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
You are also smart.

273
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Very smart?

274
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
You are also very smart.

275
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I do not like smart people.

276
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
very good

277
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
go

278
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I am not

281
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,400
You're wrong.

282
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm going to catch you

283
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,800
and find out who killed my family.

284
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,520
What are you laughing at?

285
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,000
Your Highness,

286
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
the Crown Prince is here.

287
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,920
He wants to see you.

288
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,360
His Highness wants to see

289
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
the second daughter of the Shen Family.

290
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,520
Follow him.

291
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,400
What brings you here?

292
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,320
Uncle,

293
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,480
I've been entrusted by my father

294
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
to find out about a person

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,640
who killed the second daughter of the Shen Family, Shen Qianye.

296
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
Why did you ask for him?

297
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,880
I heard that you took away the second daughter of the Shen Family.

298
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,720
The Shen Family reported this to my father.

299
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,080
They were shocked.

300
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
They said that you took her daughter

301
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,960
as a slave.

302
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,800
The Shen Family has no demands.

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
I just hope that you can let her go

304
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,720
and let her go home safely.

305
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Safe?

306
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,200
Where can Shen Qianye be safe?

307
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm not sure.

308
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,400
So you really brought her back?

309
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Uncle,

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,160
it doesn't matter what you do in your daily life.

311
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,200
But she's the daughter of a court official.

312
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,120
How can you...

313
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,800
Qianye.

314
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,800
Your Highness, Your Highness.

315
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,640
luorose

316
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,420
Truth be told I lost my blue love

317
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Didn't you fall in love with a complete

318
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,320
He or she is totallyσι

319
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,560
In this world What should we choose artificial or artificial

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,960
In this world
