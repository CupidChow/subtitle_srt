Nig requesting a drink with me...

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,560
What's up?

8
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I want to drink with the crown prince, and I'll be back in a few days.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,120
Why do you want to drink?

10
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,560
What?

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,320
I want to drink with the crown prince, and I'll be back in a few days.

12
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
I'll be with you.

13
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,560
I want to drink with the crown prince, and I'll be back in a few days.

Hey 곳

17
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
You made it sound like tomorrow?

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
You suspect me.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
No, I...

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
You suspect me of poisoning the wine.

21
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
You want to save Pei Su.

22
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,080
Pei Lang, I thought you were different.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm sorry, A'He.

24
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,720
Today is my mother's birthday.

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,480
A'He, it's all my fault.

26
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
From now on, we have no more contact.

27
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Is that clear?

28
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Yes.

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Pei Lang,

30
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,520
maybe you are the one who knows me the best in this world.

31
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
But...

32
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
I know you very well.

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,560
My lord, you are going to die tomorrow.

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Why don't you leave the money to me?

35
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
You bastard!

36
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Go!

37
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
A'He, remember,

38
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
the soul is the tree, the body is the knife.

39
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
The former is like a pebble,

40
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
the former is like a pebble,

41
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
the latter is more brutal.

42
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Don't be afraid to lose the tree.

43
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
The stronger you are, the better.

44
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Let's go.

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
My lord!

46
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
What's wrong?

47
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Pei Su...

48
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
What happened to Pei Su?

49
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
He was rescued by the late Master Xie.

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
My lord!

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
You bastard!

52
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Go, call the Crown Prince.

53
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Yes.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Pei Su!

55
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you blaming me?

56
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,560
My life is yours.

57
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I know you have another plan.

58
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
How do you know?

59
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I will cut my finger three times,

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
and I will remember it.

61
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I don't want to forget it.

62
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I know,

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I will remember it.

64
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I will never believe you.

65
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,560
I thought you wouldn't remember.

66
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Have you forgotten?

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
I have seen every newspaper.

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
It's not your family,

69
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
but you used the magic for me.

70
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
I should believe you.

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
There is no need to talk between us.

72
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,560
It's my fault that the lost child is in prison.

73
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Enough.

74
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Look at you.

75
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
How can a child not make mistakes?

76
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Can you change your mistakes?

77
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Son, remember,

78
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
sooner or later,

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,560
the whole world will be yours.

80
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
You have to make the right decision at any time.

81
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
What is this?

82
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
It's a record of the library.

83
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
You can use the wolf poison to make medicine.

84
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,560
It can repair the bones and re-reduce the organs.

85
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
What is this?

86
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
You have repaired the bones,

87
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,560
and the organ for the goddess Changqing.

88
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
She wants to thank you.

89
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Then I want to know the whole truth.

90
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I will never forget.

91
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
I will never forget.

92
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I will never forget.

93
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
I will never forget.

94
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I will never forget.

95
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
I will never forget.

96
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Asu,

97
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
look at my bunch of flowers.

98
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,560
You look beautiful.

99
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
It's not good enough.

100
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
It's just a bunch of flowers,

101
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
but it's still a bunch of flowers.

102
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
But if it keeps growing,

103
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,560
it's going to be a big trouble.

104
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,560
The best way to do it is to cut off all the roots.

105
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
It's been a long time since I saw Ximin.

106
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I miss him a little.

107
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Asu, you've really improved.

108
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Now the situation is much better.

109
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
The situation is much better.

110
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I have to go now.

111
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,560
My good brother, you're the only one who can do this.

112
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
What?

113
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
General Xi.

114
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
General Xi!

115
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Useless thing.

116
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
General Xi!

117
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
General Xi!

118
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
General Xi!

119
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
General Xi!

120
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
General Xi!

121
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
General Xi!

122
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
The End
