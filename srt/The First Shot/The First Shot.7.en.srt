00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
What are you playing?

196
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,380
- Bei.
- Bei.

197
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,740
If you weren't late,

198
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,380
we'd be done by now.

199
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,300
What's this about?

200
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,940
Report!

201
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,780
Gu Yiran had them sniff drugs.

202
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,660
This is absurd! Why are you doing this?

203
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,140
Don't get them poisoned.

204
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Stop, stop, stop.

205
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,980
It hasn't been burned
at high temperatures.

206
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,860
It's safe.

207
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,020
I just wanted to
teach everyone a new skill

208
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,580
and cover the drug scent training

209
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,340
we missed last time.

210
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,700
We were busy with Biao last time.

211
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,820
Alright. Tell me,

212
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
what did you smell?

213
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,180
The bottle I smelled

214
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,380
feels greasy.

215
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,980
Just like my family's meat stall.

216
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,500
Right.

217
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,660
It smells like lard.

218
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
You were smelling marijuana.

219
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,300
Marijuana has an oily smell.

220
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,260
Oh.

221
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,660
Oh? Did you catch that?

222
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,780
Did you get it?

223
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,420
Yes.

224
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,580
Man, just speak up.

225
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,500
What about you?

226
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,780
Well, I...

227
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,020
My goodness.

228
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,500
I can't describe it.

229
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,980
It doesn't matter.

230
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,740
Just tell us

231
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,300
what it reminds you of.

232
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,500
I got it!

233
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,820
It smells like my grandpa's factory

234
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,980
when I was a kid.

235
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,300
What, was your family making drugs?

236
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,420
Stop talking nonsense.

237
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,540
Did your grandpa work in a steel mill?

238
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,620
How do you know that?

239
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Does it smell like metal?

240
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,820
Right.

241
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,220
It's the smell of metal.

242
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,140
Because you smelled meth.

243
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,380
It's chemically synthesized,

244
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,620
so it has a smell of heavy metal.

245
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,820
No wonder it's so pungent and familiar.

246
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Remember that.

247
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,780
You try this.

248
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,540
I won't smell it.

249
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,980
Try it.

250
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,380
White Rabbit candy.

251
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,940
What kind of drug is it?

252
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
Ecstasy.

253
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
After catching so many drug dealers,

254
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,100
I know the smell

255
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,300
as soon as I walk in.

256
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,060
Impressive.

257
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,020
It smells good.

258
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,860
Ecstasy smells

259
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,340
like milk.

260
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,740
Actually, catching drug dealers

261
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,300
is like traditional Chinese medicine.

262
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,820
Observe, smell, question, and pulse.

263
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,820
Observing is like surveillance.

264
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,140
Smelling is what I just taught you.

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,580
Questioning is
asking the right questions,

266
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,500
finding clues in their words.

267
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,580
And pulsing is...

268
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,620
Giving them a good beating.

269
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,220
You can't say that.

270
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,780
When dealing with stubborn criminals,

271
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,260
sometimes you've got to give them...

272
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,860
a love education.

273
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,220
A good beating with love.

274
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,300
All you know is how to punch.

275
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,460
This class is good.

276
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,500
Why didn't you teach them this earlier?

277
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,020
There are some other bottles.

278
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,900
Would you like to try?

279
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,980
Okay.

280
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,260
Okay. Come on.

281
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,160
Eight of Bamboo.

282
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,840
[Yifeng Taxi Company]

283
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,900
Five Characters.

284
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,540
Boss Qin,

285
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,700
ready for another big game?

286
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,140
Take it easy.

287
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,660
Smoking without exhaling?

288
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,420
That's no fun.

289
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,460
One Bamboo.

290
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,180
Nine Dots.

291
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,300
Boss Mu, won't you claim it?

292
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,700
Winning too little. Not interested.

293
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,700
A few karaoke bars
got shut down in the raids,

294
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,260
but your Blue Aurora is doing well.

295
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,820
So why hasn't my cut gone up?

296
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,260
Boss.

297
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,820
At a time like this, Boss?

298
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,700
How can you be thinking about cards?

299
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,780
Yeah, Mr. Qin.

300
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,940
We've been messed with.

301
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,220
And some of our guys got arrested too.

302
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,260
Our car is broken.

303
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
- Boss Qin.
- Boss Qin.

304
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,220
We have something else to do.

305
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,660
We're leaving.

306
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll go check the account book again.

307
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,260
There must be some misunderstanding.

308
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,740
Erjin,

309
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,940
sit down.

310
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,460
Come in if you want.

311
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,620
Don't block the door.

312
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,300
Get out.

313
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,900
We're seeing the same pattern
at all the major spots

314
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,660
we're monitoring.

315
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,060
But how are they moving the goods?

316
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,180
Our guys have been staking out,

317
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,220
but we just can't figure out

318
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
when the deals are going down.

319
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,820
It's really strange.

320
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,460
Xiaoguang,

321
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,140
if I gave you 10 kilos

322
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,460
to distribute to these places,

323
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
how would you do it?

324
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,020
For me,

325
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,900
I'd start by hiding my appearance,

326
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,340
wearing low-key clothes, and using a bag

327
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,900
that doesn't stand out.

328
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,020
And if the spots are far apart?

329
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,660
I'd drive.

330
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,740
Car or motorcycle.

331
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,180
So if I stake out one spot long enough,

332
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,660
I'll catch you eventually, right?

333
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,660
In theory,

334
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,940
yeah.

335
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,260
But I could keep switching cars

336
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,780
or keep changing people.

337
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,260
How many people do you have?

338
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,500
I'll give you 50.

339
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,500
Is that enough?

340
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,020
If it's profitable,

341
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,700
it's easy to find people.

342
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,020
Come on.

343
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,660
Even if you have so many people,

344
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,100
where can you get so many cars?

345
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,180
Even if you have enough people and cars,

346
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,700
you can't find that many cars

347
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,740
that you can switch at any time.

348
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
With the amount these clubs need,

349
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
they have to be using cars.

350
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,060
I thought carefully.

351
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,460
The only vehicles that fit the bill,

352
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,420
plenty of them,

353
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,860
easy to switch,

354
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,540
and low-key...

355
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,180
Only them.

356
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,380
Taxis.

357
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:50,080
[Taxi]

358
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,020
Erjin,

359
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,220
you should understand

360
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,220
why I'm going through so much trouble

361
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,500
to establish a legitimate taxi company.

362
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,780
We're not in the taxi business.

363
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,740
Where's that fire you had
when you walked in?

364
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
Why don't you speak?

365
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,780
What can I say?

366
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,740
What do you want me to say, Boss?

367
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Some punk's trying to humiliate me.

368
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,900
If I don't deal with him,

369
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,220
how do I keep my reputation?

370
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,420
I won't listen to anyone on this.

371
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,380
Come in.

372
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,780

373
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,220
Sit next to me. Xiaohai.

374
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,700
Uncle Erjin.

375
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Erjin,

376
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,580
I had you sit across from me,

377
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,580
not to go against me.

378
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Boss,

379
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,940
you know

380
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,980
what kind of person I am.

381
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,380
I've never intended to

382
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,540
compete with anyone.

383
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,020
I just don't understand.

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,500
Go.

574
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,420
Get him inside.

575
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,260
Hurry up.

576
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,780
Hurry up.

577
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Come on, keep up.

578
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,020
Hurry.

579
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,180
Come on, keep up.

580
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,180
Come on, keep up.

581
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Go. Move it.

582
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,140
Bei,

583
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,900
still at work?

584
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,580
Go.

585
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Don't stop.

586
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,660
Keep up.

587
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,700
Bei, they started it!

588
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,780
No more talking. Move it.

589
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,980
Bei.

590
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
What happened?

591
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,940
Just a bunch of punks brawling.

592
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,860
I'll go interrogate them.

593
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,580
You head back. I'll stay longer.

594
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,740
Li.

595
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,100
You are here.

596
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,860
Have a seat, anywhere you like.

597
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,060
How many of you?

598
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,780
Please sit here.

599
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,820
What would you like to eat?

600
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,620
This is our menu.

601
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Please take a look.

602
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,580
What's good here?

603
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,780
Chicken ribs and pot stew.

604
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,100
We want some chicken ribs.

605
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,740
Chicken ribs.

606
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,460
Dad.

607
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,660
Uncle, we're back.

608
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,900
Hey, sweetheart, you're back.

609
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,060
Where is your brother?

610
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,140
Working late.

611
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,020
Again?

612
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,340
He said he'll be back later.

613
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,660
You guys sit down.

614
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,420
Chicken ribs, keep going.

615
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,580
Mom.

616
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,860
You came back just in time.

617
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,700
Sit down and eat while it's hot.

618
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,940
Beer.

619
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,140
It's fine, you guys start eating.

620
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,900
A dozen.

621
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,460
A dozen beers.

622
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,060
That's all.

623
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,340
Just that? Alright.

624
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,740
Alright, coming right up.

625
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,900
Peanuts, smashed cucumbers,

626
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,260
four chicken ribs,

627
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,140
fish stew,

628
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
and a dozen beers.

629
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,980
Got it.

630
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,100
Excuse me.

631
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,860
Hurry with the beer and cold dishes.

632
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,860
Sure, right away.

633
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,740
Find an excuse to start something.

634
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,100
Yes.

635
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,300
Excuse me. Hurry up.

636
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,180
How'd it go?

637
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,420
Just finished questioning.

638
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,660
He was pretty cooperative.

639
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,700
What, want to chat more?

640
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
Yeah, just a bit.

641
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,180
Bei.

642
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,100
Not bad.

643
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,100
Thank you, Bei.

644
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,860
Didn't expect that.

645
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,020
You're quite a fighter.

646
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,100
I did time, you know.

647
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,380
Went in young,

648
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,540
and got bullied.

649
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,380
Then I started training

650
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,100
with a martial arts guy inside.

651
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,540
Took a few years to hold my own.

652
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,140
I do have some skills,

653
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,620
but purely for self-defense.

654
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,260
The last time we questioned you
in our office,

655
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,460
you acted all timid
and like you were being bullied.

656
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,140
You were putting on an act for us,
weren't you?

657
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,420
I wasn't, really, Bei.

658
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,180
I'm not afraid of fighting.

659
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,020
But taking a life? That's different.

660
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,060
That scares me.

661
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,340
What happened today?

662
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,980
Why did you beat up Lin Jiang?

663
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,980
He's trying to take our turf.

664
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,980
Your turf?

665
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,900
What turf?

666
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,180
Our family runs a taxi company.

667
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,340
He brought in a bunch
of unlicensed taxis,

668
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,580
stealing our business.

669
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,380
Even got our drivers beaten up.

670
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,220
I thought your family ran a pharmacy.

671
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,100
That's my sister.

672
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,260
This is my godfather.

673
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Which company?

674
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,100
Yifeng Taxi.

675
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,820
Your godfather is Qin Yi?

676
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
You know my godfather?

677
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Am I asking the questions, or are you?

678
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,140
Besides working as a security guard
at the glass factory,

679
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,180
you're also a thug for Qin Yi?

680
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,740
I wouldn't call it being a thug.

681
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,300
I'm just an occasional bodyguard
for my godfather.

682
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,780
Doesn't look occasional to me.

683
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,660
Look,

684
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,500
you've done

685
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,660
your time.

686
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,060
That's behind you.

687
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,540
Now you've got a legit job

688
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,780
and a family who cares about you.

689
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,540
So think clearly about how

690
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,820
you want to live your life from now on.

691
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,980
Enjoy your drinks, everyone.

692
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,580
Don't forget anything.
Clean up before you go.

693
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,980
This Friday, I'll set it up.

694
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,460
We'll see who's really got true bonds.

695
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,420
Okay.

696
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,140
Let's call it a night.

697
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,580
Yeah, we're good.

698
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,940
Time to settle up.

699
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,020
I got it, I got it.

700
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,580
We're wrapping up here.

701
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,660
No need to argue, man.

702
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,140
I'll cover the bill.

703
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,540
I'll pay.

704
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,820
Don't stop me.

705
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,900
Told you I got it.

706
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,020
Sit down.

707
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,060
I got it.

708
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,260
Excuse me.

709
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,460
There are a few beers left.

710
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,420
Can we return them?

711
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,260
Sure, no problem.

712
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,060
Hello.

713
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm going back now.

714
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,180
Save some food for me.

715
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,980
How can our chicken ribs possibly

716
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,500
taste like White Rabbit candy?

717
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,500
Are you drunk?

718
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,500
White Rabbit?

719
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,740
Take this to the kitchen.

720
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,020
I'll clean up that table.

721
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,340
Where is the owner?

722
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,620
What's up with your cooking?

723
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,420
Take your parents.
Get out through the back door.

724
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,060
Call the police.

725
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,460
Run!

726
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,500
- Run, quick!
- Dad!
