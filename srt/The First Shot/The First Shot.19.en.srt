00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
Don't go anywhere.

192
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,280
Wait for me here.

193
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,760
I'll be right back.

194
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,160
Do you remember what you said?

195
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,960
"Don't go anywhere.

196
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,360
Wait for me to come back."

197
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,280
Why couldn't you people
who wanted to desert me

198
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,760
just tell me the truth?

199
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Why did you all have to lie to me?

200
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,760
Stay here and wait for me to come back.

201
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
But I'm scared.

202
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,720
Where are you going, Bei?

203
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
Remember, don't make a sound.

204
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,040
Wait for me to come back.

205
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,760
I'll definitely come back to get you.

206
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
It was such a cold winter.

207
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
When the human traffickers took me back,

208
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
I was nearly frozen stiff.

209
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
Just before I passed out, I thought,

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
"My big brother must have forgotten me."

211
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
I wasn't going to abandon you,

212
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
I swear.

213
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,440
I wasn't going to leave you there.

214
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,600
After we ran off together,

215
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
we hid in that garbage dump.

216
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Then I went out to get help,

217
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,800
but as soon as I did, I passed out.

218
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
I've had a high fever

219
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,120
for two days.

220
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
I've been unconscious for two days.

221
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
As soon as I woke up,

222
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,360
I took the police back
to the garbage dump to get you,

223
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
but you were already gone.

224
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,240
I took them
to the human traffickers' hideout too,

225
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,680
but they'd already fled.

226
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,160
I didn't know where else
to look for you.

227
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
Six months later,

228
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,600
in early June,

229
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,600
the police busted the human traffickers,

230
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,520
and they

231
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
dug up the body of a little boy
in the backyard.

232
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,080
Both the height

233
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
and age

234
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,560
matched yours.

235
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
So you thought that was me?

236
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,720
Ever since then, I've made it a habit

237
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
to bring sodas to that garbage dump

238
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
every year in early June

239
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,280
to remember you.

240
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,360
You've been through a lot
over the years.

241
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,880
Now that we've reunited,

242
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,760
we should

243
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
look out for each other

244
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,680
no matter what happens.

245
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,350
I want to take you somewhere.

246
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,550
Look at me!

247
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,190
You're so bad at this.

248
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,350
Do you remember this place?

249
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,750
Of course, I do.

250
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,150
On the day we escaped,

251
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,150
we ran through the woods
and crossed this river, right?

252
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,510
I remember

253
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,790
that we ran on this frozen river
for what felt like forever.

254
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,870
That's right.

255
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,630
Back then, this river seemed so wide,

256
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,150
and it seemed impossible
to reach the other side.

257
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,830
You were so small

258
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,510
and so short

259
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,310
back then.

260
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,790
You could barely run on the ice!

261
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,870
Are you making fun of me now?

262
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,430
Trying to pull a sneak attack, are you?

263
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,790
I'll throw you into the river!

264
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,630
Alright, I surrender!

265
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,590
Bei, don't sigh.

266
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,230
Sighing brings bad luck.

267
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,230
Back then, when we were
running on the ice,

268
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,510
I kept hearing the ice cracking,

269
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,310
and I was really worried
we'd fall into the river.

270
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,150
It wouldn't have been
so bad to die together.

271
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,630
At least we wouldn't have felt alone.

272
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,430
I don't think so.

273
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,030
I'm not ready to die yet.

274
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,390
There are still
so many things I want to do.

275
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,430
Not only are we going to stay alive,

276
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,070
but we're also going
to make the most of this life, Xiaohai.

277
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,030
No,

278
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,310
Lele.

279
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,720
When I was waiting for you
at the garbage dump,

280
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
I was so scared,

281
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,440
so I started singing
to whistle in the dark.

282
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,560
It was that song you taught me.

283
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,910
Do you remember it?

284
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,310
♪I want to sing a song♪

285
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,990
♪That old song♪

286
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,030
♪You'll sing it softly♪

287
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,630
♪And I'll follow along♪

288
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,430
♪I hope you'll remember♪

289
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,630
♪Forever and ever♪

290
00:24:51,710 --> 00:25:00,630
♪The shining days we shared together♪

291
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,590
What's that smell?

292
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,350
Is our home turning into a shelter now?

293
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,510
Your brother and Xiaohai
drank until 2 AM last night.

294
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,190
Mr. Gu and Xiaoguang

295
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,710
carried them back here.

296
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,550
They barely had any sleep.

297
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,590
Just let them sleep a bit longer.

298
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,510
Come on.

299
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,390
Let's go.

300
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,510
"Bei,

301
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
I have an early shift today,

302
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,790
so I'm off to work.

303
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,710
I'll work hard

304
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,790
and become someone you can be proud of."

305
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,550
When drug users take meth,

306
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,990
they usually block the door cracks

307
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,910
to prevent the smell from escaping
and raising suspicion.

308
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,230
- Police!
- Police! Don't move!

309
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,830
Hang on!

310
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,030
Just a moment!

311
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,950
Still taking it, huh?

312
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,970
Let go!

313
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,150
Give me the bottle!

314
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,750
Give it back!

315
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,950
Give me the other hand!

316
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,310
Zhang Xueyao,

317
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,630
there's a woman out here!

318
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,270
Come on!

319
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,150
Can you hear me?

320
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,430
Give me the needle.

321
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,030
Look out!

322
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,430
Stop moving!

323
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,830
Let go of me!

324
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,310
Move!

325
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,830
Stop!

326
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,070
Take a good look. Is this your child?

327
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,190
Answer me! Is this your child?

328
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,470
I've finished the interrogation, Bei.

329
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,390
Here.

330
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,430
The way they distribute drugs

331
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,910
is getting more and more absurd.

332
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,630
The goods were bought

333
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,390
from a sanitation worker
under Ermen Bridge.

334
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,710
And these two from the hotel

335
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,870
swore they weren't dealers.

336
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,270
I don't think they were lying.

337
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,510
Having seen how they wouldn't even
waste a single hit,

338
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,030
I think they were telling the truth.

339
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,990
Let's get the facts straight first.

340
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,710
Yao,

341
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,510
go talk to their neighbors

342
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,790
and find out more about those two.

343
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,950
Xiaoguang,

344
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,750
head to the bridge
and find that sanitation worker.

345
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,590
- Got it.
- Bei,

346
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,430
we found the kid's other guardian.

347
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,350
He'll be here to pick up this kid soon.

348
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,710
The kid's father?

349
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,950
Grandfather.

350
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,870
No idea who the father is.

351
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,150
I can't believe

352
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,430
she just left such a cute baby
on the windowsill.

353
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,230
Drugs really are destructive,

354
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,150
aren't they?

355
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,630
Meth causes

356
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,670
even greater harm
than ecstasy and ketamine.

357
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,270
It leads to physical dysfunction

358
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,230
and destroys the nervous system.

359
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,630
People under its control

360
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,230
become emotionally numb,

361
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,790
losing even the most basic human dignity

362
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,790
and feelings.

363
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,990
There, there.

364
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,110
I've got you.

365
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,750
Stop staring.

366
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,670
Why did you have to scare the baby?

367
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,710
There, there.

368
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,670
Let's ignore that scary man.

369
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,030
I wonder if the baby will

370
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,710
remember what happened today.

371
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,550
This could cause serious trauma.

372
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,230
She's too young to remember this,

373
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,550
right?

374
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,150
Memory

375
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,710
usually starts forming
between the ages of two and three,

376
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,590
but awareness begins

377
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,150
as early as one month old.

378
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,270
Some images can sink
into the subconscious mind.

379
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,190
Not remembering
doesn't mean they won't be affected.

380
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,230
Alright.

381
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,550
Let's trace the source

382
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,150
and get to the root of the problem.

383
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,710
Got it.

384
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,350
Understood.

385
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:23,170
[Halan Detention Center]

386
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,350
Madam,

387
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,870
I'm out.

388
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,150
Good.

389
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,310
But don't cause any more trouble.

390
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,070
If what happened with Song back then
comes to light,

391
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,270
we'll all be done for.

392
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,870
I was careless.

393
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,670
Don't worry, Madam.

394
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,550
If anything happens, I'll take the fall.

395
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,590
You'll take the fall?

396
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,870
How?

397
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,350
It's always me who has to cover for you.

398
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,990
The police are definitely
watching you now.

399
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,790
Lie low,

400
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,750
and stay out of our business
in Halan for a while.

401
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,630
Understood.

402
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,870
Be extra careful

403
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,190
with this new batch.

404
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,830
Keep an eye out at all times.

405
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,990
We can't afford any slip-ups.

406
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,830
Got it?

407
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,310
Yingzi?

408
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,470
Why are you here so early today?

409
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,830
There wasn't much going on
at the factory today,

410
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,110
so I came over early.

411
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,150
Happy birthday.

412
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,870
We're already an old married couple.

413
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,230
Why bother buying me flowers?

414
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,510
What a waste of money.

415
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,990
It didn't cost much.

416
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,870
I saw them on my way here,

417
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,190
so I just bought some.

418
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,590
They were grown in a greenhouse.

419
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,710
They've got such a bright color.

420
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,910
I still have some accounts to go over.

421
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,910
Why don't you rest for a bit?

422
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,710
Sure.

423
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,190
- Once I'm done, we'll head home.
- Okay.

424
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,750
Don't overwork yourself.

425
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,670
Did you bring your camera?

426
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,870
Of course.

427
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,910
How could I go to a concert
without a camera?

428
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,590
Don't just take pictures of your idols.

429
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,390
Get some shots of the scenery too.

430
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,870
I haven't been to the capital yet.

431
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,150
Take some pictures
of the Great Wall for me.

432
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,110
I'm only there for two days.

433
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,150
I won't have time

434
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,670
to visit the Great Wall.

435
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,070
Fine.

436
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,350
Stop right there!

437
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,270
Are you alright?

438
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,470
Are you hurt?

439
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,790
Ouch, my ankle.

440
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,950
I twisted my ankle.

441
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,390
It's my fault.

442
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,510
I was careless.

443
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,150
How is this your fault?

444
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,790
That motorcycle guy was going too fast.

445
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,790
It's his fault.

446
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,470
You need to go home
and put some medicine on.

447
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,910
I can't. I need to catch my train.

448
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,310
- Let me help you. Be careful.
- Ouch.

449
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,630
The bike's broken now.

450
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,830
Let's get a cab.

451
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,790
We'll get a cab.

452
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,710
We're almost there.

453
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,910
Taking a cab would be a waste of money.

454
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,910
I'll just hop my way over.

455
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,830
Don't be ridiculous.

456
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,870
Once you're on the train,

457
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,270
ask the attendant for some ice

458
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,190
or an iced soda.

459
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,470
Use it to ice your ankle.

460
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,070
Alright.

461
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,830
You're nagging at me like my brother.

462
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,590
Look at you. You're sweating

463
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,110
like you've just washed your face.

464
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,950
You need to work out more often.

465
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,670
That's because I'm a young man

466
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,830
with a fast metabolism.

467
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,710
You twisted your ankle,
and you're still making fun of me?

468
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,110
Why are you walking so unevenly?

469
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,560
Am I that heavy?

470
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,280
You're as light

471
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,760
as a feather.

472
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,640
Then what's going on with you?

473
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,840
Worry about yourself first.

474
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,560
Do you know
the medical term for a twisted ankle?

475
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
It's called an ankle sprain.

476
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,480
You should take it seriously.

477
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,000
Ice your ankle tonight,

478
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,880
and apply heat to it tomorrow night.

479
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,080
Stop shaking your head.

480
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Are you listening to me?

481
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,640
The hotel room has a kettle, right?

482
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,560
Boil some water,

483
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,760
heat up a towel,

484
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,960
wrap it in a plastic bag,
and put it on your ankle.

485
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
It'll help reduce bruising.

486
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,200
It's partly my fault.

487
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,080
With the train station so close,

488
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,960
I thought it was unnecessary
to drive you there in Bei's car.

489
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,240
That car's low on gas anyway.

490
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,720
We would've had to
detour to the gas station.

491
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,760
That could've
made you miss your train...

492
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What's wrong?

493
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Let's go to the hospital.

494
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,320
Why?

495
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
This is just a scrape.

496
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,680
We're almost at the station.

497
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,920
You still have that concert to go to.

498
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Stop moving! Don't...

499
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,240
Be careful

500
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,200
with your ankle.

501
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,280
I'm not going!

502
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,240
Let's go to the hospital.

503
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,360
Time for cake!

504
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,600
It's so sweet!

505
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,640
I love cream cakes!

506
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
I'll buy you

507
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,160
an even bigger one
for your birthday, okay?

508
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
Okay!

509
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Jianmin.

Thank you!

Wait.

516
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,070
Make a wish first.

517
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,790
Right.

518
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,750
Make a wish.

519
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,310
I hope Mommy makes
lots and lots of money

520
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,430
so she can buy me lots of presents!

521
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,390
You little smart cookie,

522
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,750
always getting the first wish
on everyone's birthday.

523
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,790
Let your mommy go first.

524
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,990
Actually, my wish is very simple.

525
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,390
I just hope everyone in our family

526
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,070
can stay safe and happy.

527
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,030
Make the wish in your heart.

528
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,910
If you say it out loud,
it won't come true.

529
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,430
- Alright.
- Make another wish.

530
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,230
Done.

531
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,670
Let's blow out the candles.

532
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,790
One, two, three.

533
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,750
Let's cut the cake!

534
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,950
Time to cut the cake!

535
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,350
Let's give the first piece
to Daddy, okay?

536
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,790
Give it to Mao first.

537
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,470
Here, Mao.

538
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,550
Give her this one,

539
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,710
the one with more flowers on it.

540
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,350
That one? Okay.

541
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,470
Here you go, Mao.

542
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,550
Now, let's give your uncle a big piece.

543
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,470
Look how skinny you are.

544
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,590
Eat more.

545
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,350
Yingzi,

546
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,110
thank you for giving me

547
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,190
such a warm family.

548
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,470
I should be thanking you.

549
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,510
Thank you for being
so understanding of us.

550
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,670
I'm so glad

551
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,710
I didn't miss out on you.

552
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,830
In order to win Mommy's heart,

553
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,390
he used to go fishing every day.

554
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,870
What should you call him?

555
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,350
It's Mommy's birthday today,

556
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,190
so Mao is especially happy, right?

557
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,110
Here, this piece of chocolate
is for you.

558
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,310
Do you like it?

559
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,230
You little smart cookie,

560
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,710
you really do know everything.

561
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,070
Whenever Mommy and I go to the park,
he's always there.

562
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,650
[Fall of 1994]

563
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,430
Are you fishing?

564
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,510
Yes.

565
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,750
Keep your voice down.

566
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,990
But where are the fish?

567
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,750
The fish are in the water.

568
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,350
See, as soon as that float moves,

569
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,790
I can pull the line.

570
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,150
Mao!

571
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,200
Why did you run off again?

572
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,720
It's you.

573
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,880
Hello.

574
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,320
What are you...?

575
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm just hanging out with my kid here.

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,360
Mao, say hello to Uncle Jianmin.

577
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,720
Hello, Uncle Jianmin.

578
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,440
Hello, Mao.

579
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,280
Mommy, can I watch him fish?

580
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,680
Let's not bother Uncle Jianmin.

581
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,400
How about we go fly the kite instead?

582
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
Okay.

583
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
We're leaving then.

584
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,360
Let's go.

585
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,080
You weren't bothering me at all.

586
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,880
Thank you.

587
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,440
Hey, Mao!

588
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,400
I... I've caught some fish,

589
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,000
but I can't eat them all by myself.

590
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
How about I give you one?

591
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,720
Mommy doesn't like fish.

592
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,360
She thinks they're too bony.

593
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,880
Thank you anyway.

594
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,160
You should keep them.

595
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,600
If you can't finish them,
you can freeze them.

596
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,640
Thanks again.

597
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Let's go.

598
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,120
Goodbye, Uncle Jianmin.

599
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,920
Now that you have Jianmin
to pick out the bones for you,

600
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,840
you like eating fish, don't you?

601
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,440
It's like I've been
catching up on all the fish

602
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,760
I missed out on as a kid.

603
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,040
Take this after meals.

604
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
Taking it on an empty stomach
will hurt your stomach.

605
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Bei.

606
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,480
What's with this?

607
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,200
I got hit by a motorcycle.

608
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,880
That's not what I'm asking about.

609
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,760
It's just a small injury.
It'll heal in a couple of days.

610
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm asking why your foot
is on the table!

611
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
Bei, what's wrong with you?

612
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
He's injured!

613
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,880
So you're a hero now?

614
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
And you're taking medicine
for this tiny injury?

615
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,320
He's still injured!

616
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,160
I'm talking to him.
Why do you keep jumping in?

617
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,200
You're always so annoying.

618
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,080
I hate talking to you!

619
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,800
You think I like talking to you?

620
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,960
Mom wants to talk to you.

621
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,760
You're such a nuisance now.

622
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,840
I liked you better when you were little.

623
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,320
What? Am I wrong?

624
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,200
You're getting meaner as you grow up.

625
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,680
You're very likable,

626
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,880
just as likable as always.

627
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,680
So, are you really
not going to the concert?

628
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,560
It wasn't easy to get that ticket.

629
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,630
Aren't you a huge fan
of those two pop stars?

630
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,470
I'm not that much of a fan now.

631
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,070
You're over them just like that?

632
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,670
Well,

633
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,510
feelings can change

634
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,870
in the blink of an eye.

635
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,750
Do you know what I mean?

636
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,110
You girls really are fickle.

637
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,030
You're such a fool.

638
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,110
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

639
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:49,630
Hey,

640
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,230
what's wrong?

641
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,030
The longevity noodles are ready!

642
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,590
Here.

643
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,590
Jianmin,

644
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,710
I heard

645
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,110
that even though
you caught a lot of fish,

646
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,070
it was a bowl of plain noodles
that helped you win my sister's heart.

647
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,110
I'm really curious.

648
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,430
What kind of seasoning
did you put in the noodles?

649
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,150
Were they really that good?

650
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,030
Actually, it wasn't
about the taste of the noodles.

651
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,190
It was...

652
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,670
It was all about the timing.

653
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:29,790
What do you mean by that?

654
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,480
That day,

655
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,360
a batch

656
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,600
of imported medicine
arrived at our pharmacy.

657
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,960
Some of the employees

658
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,840
had their eyes on it.

659
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,360
They stole it and tried to sell it.

660
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,640
Luckily, the matter was resolved later.

661
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,080
But because of that,

662
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,160
I went home later than usual.

663
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,680
Just as I arrived
in our apartment complex,

664
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,280
the power went out.

665
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
I knew Mao was home alone,

666
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
so I was worried sick.

667
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,600
She's so scared of the dark.

668
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,480
My heart was racing,

669
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,080
fearing something might happen to her.

670
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,440
How did you get so badly hurt?

671
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,280
Come on. Let's go to the hospital.

672
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,360
I'm fine.

673
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,680
I was worried about Mao,

674
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,440
so I rushed home

675
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,280
and stumbled.

676
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,320
It's okay. I've got
all kinds of medicine here.

677
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,000
With the power out
and the thunder rumbling,

678
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,080
Mao was really scared.

679
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,720
She tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up,

680
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,800
so she found my business card.

681
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,040
The plain noodles

682
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,280
I ate that night

683
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,760
are the best

684
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,360
I've ever had in my life.

685
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,960
Eat these longevity noodles
while they're hot,

686
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,200
or they'll get sticky.

687
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,960
Have a bite.

688
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,640
No, it's...

689
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,120
Just have a bite.

690
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,120
It's your birthday.

691
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Come on.

692
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,120
Whoever loses gets cake
smeared on their face, okay?

693
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
Someone's calling from the pharmacy.

694
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,760
I'll take the call.
You guys go ahead and eat.

695
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,560
So who lost?

696
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,560
I lost.

697
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,400
Hello, Yingzi,

698
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,120
we've got a new buyer,

699
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,480
but the cops have been
on high alert lately.

700
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,440
Should we proceed?

701
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,760
Do a thorough background check
on the buyer.

702
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,880
Only move forward if everything is fine.

703
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,960
Be really careful
when inspecting the goods.

704
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Don't bring out
the real stuff right away.

705
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,920
Make sure there are no slip-ups.

706
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,200
Got it. I'll hang up now.

707
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,240
Yingzi,

708
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,880
happy birthday.
