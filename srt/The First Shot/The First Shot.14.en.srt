00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,440
Boss, there are cops ahead.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,320
Just traffic cops. Don't be afraid.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,640
Just drive normally,

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,000
like you always do.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Boss,

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,240
we got a message from Vladivostok.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,840
They said if we pay enough money,

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,640
they can get us out anytime.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,820
But their price is a bit steep.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,280
The cops raided our place.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
Where are we supposed to get money now?

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,000
When I started hustling in my teens,

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,760
all I had was

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,240
the protective amulet

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,800
my mom gave me.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,880
Everything I've got today

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,200
is earned with my fists.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,400
Money?

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,280
As long as you're ruthless enough,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,880
you can get as much as you want.

You can go now.

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Okay.

26

The dishes are good today.

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
You chat with him first.

28
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,800
I'll start eating. I'm starving.

29
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,280
I'm hungry too.

30
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,920
Let's talk quickly

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
so we can all eat.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Talk about what?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,680
About Qin Yi.

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
There's nothing to say.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
Just say what you know.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,400
I don't know anything.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
What do you want me to say?

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,440
Do you know

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,600
what kind of sentence you could face

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,680
for smuggling, transporting,
selling drugs,

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,440
violently resisting inspection,

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
and arrest

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,440
if the case is serious?

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
You could get 15 years,

life imprisonment,

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,760
or even the death penalty.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,960
So you know that.

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,200
You seem pretty familiar
with criminal law.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
If you're in this line of work,

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
you've got to know a bit.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,680
Do you realize

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,360
you still have a choice

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,920
rather than these sentences?

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,520
If you provide us
with useful information,

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,280
it could be considered a contribution.

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,200
Dude,

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,520
are you seriously

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,560
using lines from TV dramas?

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
No worries.

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,480
I think the food here isn't bad,

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,960
right?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
It's pretty comfortable here.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm in no rush

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
to leave.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
It can be even more comfortable.

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
We even brought you some food.

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Look.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,880
The kitchen made this just for you.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,560
How is it?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Smells good, right?

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
The food here isn't bad, is it?

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,480
I was afraid you wouldn't talk.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
So I prepared it in advance.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Have some?

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
Sure smells good.

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
But I really don't know

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,800
what you want to hear.

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,880
This trick doesn't work on me, dude.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,960
It's fine if it doesn't work.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,760
it's a pity.

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
You've reached this level,

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,920
and now you have to take the fall
for your boss.

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,880
What's in it for you?

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Wouldn't you wonder

why you're the one in here

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,280
but not Qin Yi?

91
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm fine with it.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
What?

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm fine with it.

94

You're fine with it?

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
No problem then.

96
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,160
That's fine.

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,360
I have nothing to say about that.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
But does Qin Yi
appreciate your sacrifice?

99
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,880
Stop with the useless talk.

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Whether he appreciates it or not
is his business.

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm doing this because I want to.

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
Look at his determination.

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
This is what true brotherhood

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,800
and loyalty are like.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
You're really devoted.

106

If you're willing, stay here.

107

What are you worried about?

112
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
You're

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,960
so invested in our case in Halan.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
As the team leader, I'm very reassured.

115
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,960
We haven't been able
to extract anything yet.

116
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,360
All the knowledge I learned from books

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,320
hasn't been useful.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
It's just not used enough.

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,440
You've only been
in the interrogation room a few times.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,640
It's already pretty good.

121
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
When I first started
interrogating suspects,

122
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
every time I came out,

123
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,840
I doubted if I was the one
being interrogated.

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't try to comfort me.

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,520
I mean it.

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,280
As you do it more

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,160
and get used to it,

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
you don't have
as many emotions about it.

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,680
Sometimes,

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,640
experience

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
can turn into intuition.

132
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,400
So, how should you handle

133
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,720
someone like Erjin,
who's tough to crack?

134
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
Understand him more.

135
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Learn about his personality
and preferences

136
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
and then ponder slowly.

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
We have plenty of time.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
He won't be able to run away.

139
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,080
Why rush?

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
You're quite optimistic.

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,360
What else can we do?

142
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
If all the bad people in this world

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,400
were easy to catch and deal with,

144
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,080
we wouldn't be needed.

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
Let me tell you.

so he'll keep quiet.

149

In the interrogation room,

00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
there are all kinds of people.

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
Some want to confess but hesitate.

152
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
Some know

153
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
their partners are next door

154
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,920
and will compete to earn merit.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Some are long-time couples

157

and cooperate actively.

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,320
These criminals are also human.

159

As long as they have dignity
and emotions...

160
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,360
They must have weaknesses
and vulnerabilities.

We can find the breakthrough.

162
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,800
Yes.

163
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,120
Take it slow.

There's no rush.

165

so many suspects,

166
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
dealing with these big drug dealers

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
is like crossing a river
by feeling the stones.

168
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,520

Keep at it.

Right?

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,840
Keep at it.

176
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
That's the spirit.

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,400
Don't frown.

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,320
This is good.

[Halan Public Security Bureau]

180
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,430
I'm going to interrogate Erjin now.

181
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,710
I don't believe it.

182
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,110
Today, even if I have to pry it out,

183
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,230
I'll get the lead

184
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,630
on Qin Yi from Erjin.

185
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,510
Sit down.

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,990
I can't, Bei.

187
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,870
Erjin has a fake Qin Yi.

188
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,670
How could he not know
where the real one is?

189
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,390
These people are too cunning.

190
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,790
Because they're so cunning,

191
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,230
we need to use our brains
to handle things.

192
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,750
What can you achieve

193
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,910
with just this approach?

194
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,990
Erjin's using a fake Qin Yi

195
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,310
to mislead us.

196
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,510
He'd rather get caught himself
than let Qin Yi be exposed.

197
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,550
Do you think Erjin will tell you
where Qin Yi is?

198
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,430
What kind of spell

199
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,750
has Qin Yi cast on these people?

200
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,870
They're all risking their lives for him.

201
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,390
Winning people's hearts is their skill.

202
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,150
Qin Yi wouldn't be
in his current position

203
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,950
if he wasn't capable.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
That's true.

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,920
Decades of smuggling and amassing wealth

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
have resulted in a room full of gold.

207
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,200
He can't spend it or move it.

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
Isn't that a pity?

209
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes.

210
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
Our colleagues who handled the evidence

211
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
were exhausted from moving all that gold

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,760
to the evidence room.

213
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,360
A person would need

214
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,480
several lifetimes

215
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,480
to earn that much.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,480
Drug trafficking makes a lot of money.

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
That's why we need to

218
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,440
root out all these cancerous elements.

219
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,160
- Director Gao.
- Director Gao.

220
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
- Director Gao.
- Director Gao.

221
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Director Gao.

222
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,480
What's up?

223
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,600
You all look depressed.

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,160
Although Qin Yi has escaped,

225
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,240
we have set up roadblocks
across the city.

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
He can't get out of town.

227
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,640
As long as he's in Halan,

228
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,640
we'll definitely catch him.

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
On the bright side,

230
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
since we started the operation,

231
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
we've uprooted

232
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,840
the entire ecstasy chain.

233
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,920
All the Blue Aurora's Lucifer
have been confiscated.

234
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,080
You shouldn't only focus on the failures

235
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
and ignore the results.

236
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,440
The case is not closed yet.

237
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,320
Everyone, cheer up.

238
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

239
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
I have requested

240
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,240
the maximum reinforcement for you.

241
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,080
Zheng Bei, arrange it.

242
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Got it.

243
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
From now on...

244
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
From now on,

245
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,440
go home and sleep.

246
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,400
Have a good rest.

247
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,640
There will be tough battles ahead.

248
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,480
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

249
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Listen to the Director.

250
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Awake?

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
Get up if you're awake.

252
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
What for?

253
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Weren't you complaining
about the hard bed?

254
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,240
My sister has aired out
the mattress for you.

255
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,360
Let me replace it for you.

256
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,640
Get up.

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm good.

258
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
What do you mean you're good?

259
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,720
Let me tell you.

260
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
The service in the Zheng family
must be up to standard.

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
So that you have no complaints.

262
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,160
What are you doing today?

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Speak up if you have something to say.

264
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,400
Come with me to Yao's house.

265
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,520
What happened to her?

266
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,120
She's fine.

267
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,840
But she is sick in bed.

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,640
She visits her parents every week.

269
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm going this week on her behalf.

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,520
It's understandable to report good news
but not bad news.

271
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
Isn't it more convenient
to make a phone call?

272
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
No.

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,040
Why not?

274
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,160
Just come with me.

275
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,280
This is also a police inspection.

276
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,040
We have to go.

277
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,400
We shouldn't go empty-handed, right?

278
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,400
I've already bought the gifts.

279
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,320
Mr. Zhang.

280
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,800
Mrs. Zhang.

281
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
These are gifts for you.

282
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,640
I'll leave them here.

283
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.

284
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,520
This is our new colleague
from the bureau.

285
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,200
He's a young man from the south.

286
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,480
Nice to meet you.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm Zhang Xueyao's colleague.

288
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,600
My name is Gu Yiran.

289
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Nice to meet you.

290
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,600
Now, let's get to the point.

291
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,600
Go ahead.

292
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,560
They can read lips.

293
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,440
It's a good opportunity for you
to practice your undercover skills.

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Express yourself clearly. Now.

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang,
here's the situation.

296
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
During our recent operation,

297
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,160
Zhang Xueyao...

298
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,680
She performed exceptionally well.

299
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,760
Yao did an outstanding job this time.

300
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,400
So our bureau

301
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
has rewarded her

302
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,320
with a trip to Changbai Mountain.

303
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
For seven days.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
That's why she won't

305
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,400
be coming back this week.

306
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,280
We're here to check on you.

307
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
If you need any help, just let me know.

308
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,040
We'll leave you here.

309
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,640
I'll take him to get something to eat.

310
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,360
Goodbye.

311
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,200
We're leaving.

312
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,760
What were you talking about?

313
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,880
I told you to report good news,
not bad news.

314
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,080
What were you saying there?

315
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
I didn't catch on.

316
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,160
Let me explain.

317
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,200
I brought you here to understand
the real situation of everyone.

318
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,920
It's to help you
integrate with everyone.

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
It's because we consider you
part of our team.

320
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
Stop talking inappropriately.

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay.

322
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,280
Got it.

323
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Why is this candied hawthorn so sour?

324
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
Darn it.

325
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,160
It's making my teeth hurt.

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,040
What kind of
crappy candied hawthorn is this?

327
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,800
You've ruined my boss's teeth.

328
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,520
Pay up.

329
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,320
This is just the right time.

330
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,440
Pay up.

331
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,560
Where did you little brats come from?

332
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,880
You're here to bully us?

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
You two young ones,
why don't you learn to behave?

334
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
- Beat him.
- Beat him.

335
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Get lost.

336
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
She has good social connections.

337
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,960
Yao is not simple.

338
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,720
Of course.

339
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,480
I only choose the best people.

340
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't count.

341
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,160
I was invited by Director Gao.

342
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How come you don't count?

343
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,320
I tried several times

344
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
to get you here.

345
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,440
How can you say that?

346
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,760
Okay.

347
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,320
If you say so.

348
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,600
What do you mean, "if you say so"?

349
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,560
It's the truth.

350
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,040
Let me tell you.

351
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,920
In the eyes of these neighbors,

352
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,240
Yao is like

353
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
a heroine.

354
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,720
Look, when there is an issue,

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
everyone is willing to help.

356
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,400
It shows that Yao
usually protects them a lot.

357
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,040
Kindness is not given for free.

358
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,240
Yes.

359
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,240
It's really not easy
to live in such an environment.

360
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
No wonder she has
that kind of personality.

361
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,320
People used to think
she was just a tough

362
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
and fierce character.

363
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
They kept their distance from her.

364
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,400
But over time,

365
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,360
as they got to know her,

366
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,880
they realized she was actually

367
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,520
a very righteous girl.

368
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
She's always known
to protect her own people.

369
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,200
Having people to protect

370
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,240
makes her push herself
to become stronger.

371
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,760
This is quite similar to you.

372
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,120
Mr. Gu,

373
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,280
you also have people
you want to protect, right?

374
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm full.

375
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,680
Enjoy your meal.

376
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
I'll help her parents pack up.

377
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,920
It's hard to know your true feelings.

378
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,400
Mrs. Zhang,

379
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,760
I'll help you pack up.

380
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,640
Okay.

381
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
Turn around and get in the tricycle.

382
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,240
Come on.

383
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,800
Gu, think about
what you want to eat tonight.

384
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,000
After we send them back,

385
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,080
I'll treat you to a meal.

386
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,560
Okay.

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,240
Get in the tricycle.

388
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,640
Get in.

389
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Get in.

390
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
You push, I'll ride.

Let's go.

394

Go on. Push a bit.

395

The tricycle

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,800
needs some repair.

397
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
It's too heavy to ride.

No. There's no brake.

around here.

This stall

402
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,120
has been here since we were in school.

403
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,040
I've been eating here since then.

404
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
This is our special Halan dish.

405
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,040
This is grilled gluten.

Look over there.

407

414
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480

415
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,360

417
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,240
Not bad, right?

418

Do you want anything else?

419
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
No, that's enough.

Play a round of shooting.

421
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
No need. I just want to watch.

422
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,000

427
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Okay.

Not bad.

435

That's three shots.

This shouldn't be just luck, right?

Not being able to fight

438
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
doesn't mean I can't shoot.

439
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440

from the police academy.

440
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,280

Let me tell you,

444
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
aiming is disrespectful.

445
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,640
What's the point of aiming?

446
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't you just hit the target
when you shoot?

447
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,520
See?

448
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,040
After the case is closed,
will you return to Huazhou?

Why?

450

Are you trying to drive me away?

451

Maybe I want you to stay?

452

You're interrupting me.

453
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,600
Really not.

from the police academy

455
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,880

When I was ten years old,

571

I was a naughty boy.

572

Then why do you have this?

you can get it.

Drink it.

608

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,760
You human traffickers,

753
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm right here.

754
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
Wait and see.

755
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You little brat.

756
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,720
Wait and see.

757
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,160
Run!

758
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,240
Stop right there.

759
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,480
You...

760
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,000
I...

761
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,320
Kid.

762
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,720
When I found him,

763
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,320
he was covered in wounds.

764
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,360
The injuries were festering.

765
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,720
He was cold and hungry.

766
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,240
Making it out from such a distant place

767
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,240
was nothing short of a miracle.

768
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
He was in a feverish coma for two days.

769
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,760
The moment he woke up,

770
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,720
he told me there was
another missing child.

771
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
He was talking about Lele.

772
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,080
We immediately went to
search near the garbage dump.

773
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,480
But there wasn't a trace of him.

774
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,040
Later, after some inquiries,

775
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,960
an old man said
he'd seen a kid like that.

776
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
He felt sorry for him

777
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,000
and gave him something warm to eat

778
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,480
and invited him inside to warm up.

779
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
But the kid refused.

780
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
He insisted on going back
to the garbage dump.

781
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,280
He said he had to wait for his brother.

782
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,720
He was afraid that if Bei came back
and couldn't find him, he'd be worried.

783
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,560
Can you imagine

784
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,080
how much that kid trusted Zheng Bei?

785
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,760
What happened afterward?

786
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,040
You never found that kid?

787
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,600
At the time, we mobilized

788
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,920
almost the entire police force.

789
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,120
For about half a year.

790
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
In the end, all the human traffickers
were caught.

791
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
We rescued over ten children.

792
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
But Lele wasn't among them.

793
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,200
Later, we found the body

794
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,500
of a 12-year-old boy

795
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,070
in a field
behind the criminals' hideout.

796
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,150
So he probably believes
it's his fault that Lele died.

797
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:01,650
[Assorted Soda]

798
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,090
[Assorted Soda]

799
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,830
The soda is still just as sweet.

800
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,270
But you're always wearing a sad face.

801
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,110
Yeah.

802
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,710
This soda is really sweet.

803
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,030
You always got beaten up.

804
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,470
You were covered in bruises.

805
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,710
But every time you took a sip of soda,

806
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,150
you felt better right away.

807
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,510
You used to tell me
that soda was a painkiller.

808
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:46,870
Were you just fooling a kid?

809
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,030
You were just a kid yourself.

810
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,190
Let me tell you.

811
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,230
Out of all the kids,

812
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,390
you were the most resourceful.

813
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,910
Even though Big Pockmark was so fierce,

814
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,830
you always managed to trick him
into giving you soda.

815
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,550
That was easy.

816
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,270
All you had to do
was pretend to be obedient

817
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,830
and act like you were on his side.

818
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,910
Being genuinely good to someone

819
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,270
is what's really hard.

820
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,950
I know you were truly good to me.

821
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,390
So, were you really good to me?

822
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,190
The snow was so heavy.

823
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,030
I was so cold.

824
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,470
My hands and feet
were numb with cold.

825
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,190
Why did you leave me?

826
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,110
Why?

827
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,110
Zheng Bei.

828
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,790
Why did you leave me?

829
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,990
Why?

830
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,990
Why did you leave me?

831
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:51,990
Why?

832
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,070
Why?

833
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:57,990
Zheng Bei.

834
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,390
Why did you leave me?

835
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,270
Why?

836
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,510
I'm sorry.

837
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:04,630
I'm sorry.

838
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:05,870
I'm sorry.

839
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,110
I'm sorry.

840
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,110
I'm sorry.

841
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:09,710
I'm sorry.

842
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,630
Zheng Bei.

843
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:16,590
Let's go home.

844
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,490
Still not sleepy?

845
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,470
I'm alright.

846
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,830
I heard from Uncle
that you've been going to

847
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,350
that garbage dump every year
for the past few years.

848
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,790
Yeah.

849
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,050
I can't get over it.

850
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:10,990
I can't let it go.

851
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,910
I understand.

852
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,230
But, Zheng Bei,

853
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,550
you can't blame yourself like this.

854
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,750
Lele's death was the fault
of those human traffickers.

855
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,710
It wasn't your fault.

856
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,510
The traffickers deserved to die.

857
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,670
But I'm the one who left Lele there.

858
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,950
I told him to wait for me there.

859
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,350
In the end, I ran out

860
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,630
and got found by Uncle.

861
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,510
Now I've grown up,

862
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,590
but Lele is gone.

863
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,430
If I hadn't tried to escape
with him that day...

864
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,310
Forget it.

865
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:13,630
I'm rambling.

866
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,710
If you keep blaming yourself,

867
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,990
you'll just create
a thousand more "what ifs".

868
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,030
Life is long.

869
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,110
Don't carry all the pain of the past

870
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,150
on your shoulders.

871
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,230
Everyone

872
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,950
has their own fate.

873
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,190
What I need to carry,

874
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,830
I'll carry.

875
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,030
I still dream about him at night.

876
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,190
He just looks at me,

877
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,990
waiting for me.

878
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,830
A life was lost.

879
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,110
How can I just forget about it?

880
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,030
Yeah.

881
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,830
How can you just forget

882
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,550
about a life?

883
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,870
So mysterious.

884
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,990
Is this the good place you mentioned?

885
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,110
We don't have a VCR at home.

886
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,030
We might as well go to a video hall.

887
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,430
Leave it to me.

888
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:42,550
Look.

889
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,030
This one, and this one

890
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,910
are pretty good.

891
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,310
Zhao Xiaoguang!

892
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,430
Are you an idiot?

893
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,310
Don't you know

894
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,710
using horror movies
to impress girls is outdated?

895
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,230
How about something thrilling?

896
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,070
I've got everything.

897
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,750
Don't brag.

898
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,310
Show me something thrilling.

899
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,110
Take a look.

900
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,270
Let's go for the top-tier stuff.

901
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,430
I'm not short on cash.

902
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,190
Come on.

903
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,510
Check this out.

904
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,750
Three Monks?

905
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,030
Flaming Mountain.

906
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,350
Donald Duck?

907
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,470
That's it?

908
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:23,790
Boring.

909
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,750
Who watches cartoons?

910
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,390
We're not three-year-olds.

911
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,830
Dance with Ducks.

912
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,150
Fire-Spitting Lady.

913
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,470
The Carnal Sutra.

914
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,630
All starring the most popular actresses.

915
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,350
These three are the hottest right now,
and it's hard to get.

916
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,310
Would you take them?

917
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,830
We definitely would.

918
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:41,390
Alright.

919
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,630
Police!

920
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,510
You're suspected of
being involved in pornography.

921
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,590
What are you doing?

922
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,310
Let go of me.

923
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,990
In a split second,

924
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,590
I gave Zheng Nan a look.

925
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,510
In a flash, I had an idea.

926
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,830
We played along with the situation.

927
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,150
In no time,

928
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,550
the boss revealed his true colors.

929
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,230
You should've seen it.

930
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,110
Bei's sister

931
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,070
was instantly impressed by me.

932
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,230
Bei.

933
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,590
Aren't you afraid
that Zheng Nan's brother

934
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,910
will knock you out instead?

935
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:11,830
Yes, I am.

936
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,230
But tell me,

937
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,150
didn't I manage to score
a small win this time?

938
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:15,750
You did.

939
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,790
I have to say, you're pretty impressive.

940
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,190
Renting a video tape

941
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,630
and you ended up taking
on an anti-pornography case.

942
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,390
I might as well send you to that team.

943
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,310
I think that works.

944
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,590
Absolutely not.

945
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,830
I was born to be part
of the Special Investigation Team,

946
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,110
and I'll die as one
of the Special Investigation Team's

947
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:30,790
men.

948
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,110
A ghost.

949
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,830
Do you have any sense?

950
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,790
That ghost is behind you.

951
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,510
Stop doing that.

952
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,710
Holy crap.

953
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,430
When did you get here?

954
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,750
You scared the heck out of me.

955
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,070
Could I be more frightening
than a ghost?

956
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,790
Could a ghost be more terrifying
than a drug dealer?

957
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,030
Meeting time.

958
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,470
As of now,

959
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,670
all the people we've caught

960
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,390
have been interrogated one or two times.

961
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,190
But these small-time thugs

962
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,790
know nothing.

963
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,310
That's normal.

964
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,230
They just follow orders

965
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,270
and manage their little area.

966
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,790
The lower-level guys don't have access
to central information.

967
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,110
And knowing nothing

968
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,110
is actually the safest.

969
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,550
What about Erjin?

970
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,990
Still playing mute?

971
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,590
He's definitely a big shot.

972
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,990
He's willing to harm himself.

973
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,710
Now he's lost his teeth

974
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,750
and can't talk.

975
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,430
All we can do
is watch him in frustration.

976
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,670
No need to worry.

977
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,550
Let's see how long he can hold out.

978
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:24,990
The current situation,

979
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,390
in summary,

980
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,150
is that we have a lot of people

981
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,830
but no useful leads.

982
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,110
I'll report.

983
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,950
Director Gao has sent us
quite a bit of reinforcement.

984
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,710
We've also expanded

985
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,150
our search within the city.

986
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:44,350
We traced Qin Yi's

987
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,270
previous movements.

988
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,950
We even checked the recently
demolished houses

989
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,110
in the city center.

990
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,430
So far, no new findings.

991
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,230
If Boss Qin is hiding in plain sight,

992
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,590
he's really hard to find.

993
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,350
Qin Yi is cautious.

994
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,790
He handles things meticulously.

995
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,470
He looks approachable,

996
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,430
but he's actually very distant.

997
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,590
Once a person like him
gets close to someone,

998
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:09,830
it usually means they've established

999
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,430
a very strong trust.

1000
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,710
We can start investigating
from this angle.

1001
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,230
But doesn't that mean
we still have to interrogate Erjin?

1002
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,670
Qin Yi is an old bachelor.

1003
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,790
No family, no relatives.

1004
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,870
No one else.

1005
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,790
He has Jiang Xiaohai.

1006
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,270
Isn't he his adopted son?

1007
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,870
He wasn't among those
we arrested earlier.

1008
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,390
This kid likes to fight,

1009
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,750
but he definitely wasn't involved
in drug trafficking.

1010
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:31,590
We even specifically checked
among the security guards

1011
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,750
at the glass factory's White Building.

1012
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,750
He quit a long time ago
and started working on his own.

1013
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,630
Yes.

1014
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,830
He's clean.

1015
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,510
But that doesn't mean
he's severed ties with Qin Yi.

1016
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,270
It all depends

1017
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,310
on how strong

1018
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,230
their father-son relationship is.

1019
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,310
It's hard to say.

1020
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,230
If their bond is weak,

1021
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,710
they might not be in contact at all.

1022
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,190
But if their bond is strong,

1023
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,030
he definitely won't cooperate with us.

1024
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,910
He'll just say he doesn't know anything.

1025
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,270
What can we do then?

1026
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:56,310
Exactly.

1027
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,230
And Xiong even arrested him before

1028
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,350
for inciting a disturbance.

1029
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,790
What if he holds a grudge?

1030
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,870
We'll just have to try.

1031
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,670
I'll go talk to him.

1032
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,110
That's right.

1033
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,830
The fact that he could leave Qin Yi

1034
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,750
and get a proper job on his own

1035
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,550
probably means he took your advice.

1036
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,270
It shows
he understands right from wrong.

1037
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,830
Keep investigating.

1038
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,950
We need to
quickly track down Qin Yi's whereabouts.
