00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,640
Okay.

192
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,640
Are you alright?

193
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
I got choked by the smoke.

194
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,080
He was burning the evidence in there.

195
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,840
We were still late. Couldn't get it.

196
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
It's okay.

197
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,120
At least we saved him.

198
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
We'll take our time to interrogate him.

199
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760
You rest up first.

200
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,000
Madam,

201
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Wang set his own office on fire.

202
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Zheng Bei saved him.

203
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
He was carried onto the ambulance.

204
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,920
How badly is he hurt?

205
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,920
We don't know yet.

206
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,680
Madam,

207
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,520
Han Li just died,

208
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
and Wang started a fire.

209
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,600
Is the pharmaceutical factory
being watched by the cops?

210
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,600
All the raw material records

211
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,200
are in the factory.

212
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
Jianmin

213
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,920
must have known a long time ago

214
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,480
what kind of business I was running.

215
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
I don't have any great ambitions.

216
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,840
I just want to protect you and Mao.

217
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,880
Eat while it's hot.

218
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Or it'll taste too fishy.

219
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,200
Don't wait for me.

220
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
- Your tie isn't even on properly.
- I'll go buy it.

221
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,600
Look, it's fine.

222
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Go ahead and eat.

223
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,240
I'll wait for you.

224
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,520
Jianmin sacrificed himself

225
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,520
for me.

226
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Even though you cleaned the trunk,

227
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,240
we still found bloodstains

228
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
in the corners.

229
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,880
The blood sample
has been sent for testing.

230
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,040
Whether it's Han Li's or not,

231
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,240
we'll soon know.

232
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,160
Dragging this out

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
isn't doing you any good.

234
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,960
He's not a stranger. Don't be rude.

235
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,120
Wang,

236
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,360
we go way back.

237
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,560
What's your trouble?

238
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,440
Whatever it is,

239
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,000
just let me know.

240
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,640
I have no excuse.

241
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,040
I confess.

242
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
I killed her.

243
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,760
Why are you doing this?

244
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,760
I haven't even finished the pickles
your wife gave me.

245
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
You had such a happy family.

246
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
How could you ruin it?

247
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Besides, Wang,

248
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
I know what kind of person you are.

249
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,600
Why would you kill her?

250
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,360
Han Li knew I had a wife

251
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
but kept bothering me.

252
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,720
She didn't respect Yingzi either.

253
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,680
But Han Li has been pestering you
for a while.

254
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,920
Why couldn't you take it
all of a sudden?

255
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,760
If you do nothing,

256
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,560
your family stays intact.

257
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Now that you've killed her,

258
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
your family is truly ruined.

259
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
Do you think we'll believe

260
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
such a ridiculous reason?

261
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
It was an accident.

262
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,440
We were arguing, I got mad

263
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
and hit her.

264
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,560
I didn't expect it to go this far.

265
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,160
Officer Zheng,

266
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,320
I won't waste your time.

267
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,400
The murder weapon was a military shovel.

268
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,840
I threw it into the woods

269
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,520
on the east bank of the river.

270
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
I burned

271
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
her ID card and other stuff.

272
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
I set the fire
because I knew I couldn't hide it.

273
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
I'd just die.

274
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Wang,

275
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,440
a lot of things were missing

276
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
from the fire scene.

277
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
Let's be honest,

278
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,680
that pharmaceutical factory
doesn't belong to you,

279
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,240
does it?

280
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
You're just an accountant.

281
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,400
Why would you take the fall for them?

282
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,440
Even if you don't care about yourself,

283
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,720
you should think about your wife

284
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
and Mao.

285
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,840
It's sweltering outside.

286
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
Wang. Take a look.

287
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,680
Your wife has been worried sick

288
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,120
about you.

289
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,840
She's been waiting all night.

290
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,440
If you cooperate with us,

291
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,240
you might still have a chance

292
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,880
to see Mao grow up.

293
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,840
And your wife will have something
to look forward to.

294
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,800
[On the night of the incident]

295
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,860
What's the matter?

296
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,260
Take a look at this.

297
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,260
What...

298
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,660
What is all this?

299
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,500
Where did you get it?

300
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,460
I found it in the Director's office.

301
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,300
Why... why did you copy

302
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,580
these records?

303
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,460
I just wanted you to see

304
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,220
what kind of person
Jiang Yingzi really is.

305
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,340
Behind your back,

306
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,700
she's selling ephedrine
for drugs production with the Director.

307
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,100
This is a capital offense.

308
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,820
Well, I...

309
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,820
There might be a misunderstanding

310
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,580
in these records.

311
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,740
Well...this is what I think.

312
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,500
I'll take it back and review it.

313
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,900
What more is there to review?

314
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,260
I've reviewed it many times.

315
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,740
They are making drugs.

316
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,220
The meth.

317
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,060
This is illegal.

318
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,220
What do you think

319
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
I should do?

320
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Financial transactions
require our signatures.

321
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,580
If something goes wrong,

322
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
we'll all be held responsible,

323
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,660
especially you.

324
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,620
You're such an honest person.

325
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,700
Why would you take the blame for her?

326
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,980
We must report this to the police.

327
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,820
I know you're shocked,

328
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,460
but we're running out of time.

329
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,180
Jiang Yingzi

330
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,300
is a drug dealer.

331
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,100
But she

332
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,540
is also my wife.

333
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,140
Did you

334
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,380
know this already?

335
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,380
Officer Zheng, you misunderstood.

336
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,780
I didn't destroy anything.

337
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,540
I just didn't want to live anymore.

338
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,120
Have a bun.

339
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,040
You need to eat to live.

340
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,480
If you don't like buns,
drink some soy milk.

341
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,200
Here.

342
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Bei.

343
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
I don't feel like eating.

344
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,560
I feel upset.

345
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,080
I've tried everything.

346
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,480
But he insisted
that it was a crime of passion.

347
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,120
When asked about the factory,

348
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,280
he just shut his eyes and said nothing.

349
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,960
He is so unafraid of death.

350
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,720
How can he be an ordinary person?

351
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,560
We used to think he was honest,

352
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,480
but now it seems like

353
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,560
his image of a family man
and good husband

354
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,600
is just an act.

355
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,320
In the end,

356
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,920
we still don't even know
what was written

357
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
in the destroyed records.

358
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
We've checked the factory thoroughly,

359
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,080
and all production records are gone.

360
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,840
The fire he set

361
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,160
left us with

362
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
no useful clues.

363
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,600
But there are other ways.

364
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,200
The pharmaceutical factory

365
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,080
is still under the Drug Administration.

366
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,600
If the factory's records are gone,

367
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,400
the Drug Administration
should have them, right?

368
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,360
Right.

369
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,480
Even if Yunhui has power,

370
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,920
it can't control
the Drug Administration.

371
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,280
Guys,

372
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
the autopsy report is out.

373
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
How is it?

374
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,600
Everything was soaked and deformed.

375
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,920
What clues could there be?

376
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
There is.

377
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,240
The medical examiner found

Wang seemed very nice.
