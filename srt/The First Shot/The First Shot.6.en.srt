00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,500
It's hot. Don't touch it.

192
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,500
Take it. How come you're back?

193
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,460
Why can't I come back?

194
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,420
It's nothing serious.

195
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,540
It's just a scratch.

196
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,420
I was thinking

197
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,460
about cooking for you guys.

198
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,660
Uncle, with your limp leg,

199
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,700
you better sit this one out.

200
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,860
You little punk,

201
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,780
are you messing with me?

202
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,660
No.

203
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,620
Whether I'm hurt or not,

204
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,380
the ground's still uneven.

205
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm concerned about you.

206
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,380
Don't give me that.

207
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,580
Guozhu, come on, eat.

208
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,340
The noodles from Dongtie
are very tasty. Very chewy.

209
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,820
I'm feeling a bit nauseous.

210
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,820
I have heart palpitations.

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,820
What's wrong?

212
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,460
Maybe I drank too much coffee.

213
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,780
Really?

214
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,340
Shouldn't too much coffee
make you super alert?

215
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,460
Why are you so out of it?

216
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,620
When you overdose on caffeine,

217
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,580
it can

218
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,460
overstimulate your
central nervous system,

219
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,740
causing upset stomach
and mental burnout.

220
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,860
I'm feeling it.

221
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,940
Tissues.

222
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
Send them to me later.

223
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm in a hurry.

224
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,060
Give his to me.

225
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
Isn't this just like drug-taking?

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,740
Yes.

227
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,580
One of the ingredients
in Red Dragon is caffeine.

228
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,580
Looks like today's lesson
didn't go to waste.

229
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,700
I'm not deaf.

230
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,860
Over there...

231
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
So, being spaced out,

232
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,780
bloodshot eyes,

233
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,100
and those yellow, stained teeth

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,380
are all signs of drug use, right?

235
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,900
Yes.

236
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,260
Eat up.

237
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,940
Come with me to the train station after.

238
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,740
Sir.

239
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,420
Excuse me,

240
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,900
is someone here called Zhang Tianxiao?

241
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,380
He is in the next carriage.

242
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,300
It's him, right?

243
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,100
Yes.

244
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,300
Okay. Thank you.

245
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,620
Stop!

246
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,180
Zhang Tianxiao.

247
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,740
Sit down.

248
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,700
Sit down.

249
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,100
Sit down.

250
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,380
Don't make me attack you.

251
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,100
Sit down.

252
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you deaf?

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Why did you run?

254
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,920
If I let you get away,
I might as well quit.

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,880
What did I do?

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,480
Don't you know?

257
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Let's talk about your part-time job.

258
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
I have no part-time job.

259
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,320
No part-time job?

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,520
Do you earn much as a conductor?

261
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Don't cover it. I saw it last time.

262
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Empty your pocket.

263
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Hurry up.

264
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,840
Pistachio.

265
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,520
Prescription sleeping pills from Japan.

266
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,560
A lot of people take it

267
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,040
a few hours after using drugs

268
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
to ease the discomfort from the high.

269
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
What's your relationship
with Chen Liang?

270
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,320
Your ticket, please.

271
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,160
Every two months,

272
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Liang would take this train

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,400
from Huazhou.

274
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,320
How did he get past the checks

275
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,800
at the platform and on the train?

276
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,120
Garbage, please.

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,880
Is there any garbage?

278
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,640
Garbage, please.

279
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,600
Garbage, please.

280
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,320
Garbage, please.

281
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,440
Garbage, please.

282
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,960
Make way, please.

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,080
Be careful.

284
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Liang and his crew
bribed the Huazhou station staff.

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
Once on board, I was in charge.

286
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
The people and the goods
entered Halan separately.

287
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,640
I needed to keep an eye
on things on the train.

288
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
No one checks there.

289
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
You got the goods off the train?

290
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
When the train slowed down

291
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,160
near Halan's outskirts,

292
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,440
I tossed the package out the window.

293
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,720
The pickup guy was already
waiting at the agreed spot.

294
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,520
Bribing a single conductor

295
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,880
can give you control
over an entire transportation line,

296
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,800
bypassing all the checks

297
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,960
on the platform and the train.

298
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,640
What a good deal.

299
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,560
Were they transporting ecstasy or meth?

300
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,640
Ecstasy.

301
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Just ecstasy?

302
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,000
Never transported meth?

303
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,600
But I once heard Liang complain.

304
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,720
He said people in Halan
had expanded their business.

305
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
They ditched ecstasy

306
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
for meth

307
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,400
since it's more profitable.

308
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Did they ever mention

309
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,280
who's handling the pickup in Halan?

310
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,640
I've only heard Liang mention it once.

311
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,680
A Yuedong guy was
responsible for transporting goods.

312
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Later on, he ran away with the goods.

313
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,040
The buyer in Halan

314
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,440
paid but didn't get the goods.

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,320
Huazhou sent out a new batch
as a replacement.

316
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Liang felt it wasn't that simple.

317
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,280
Someone might be scheming against us.

318
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,540
[Drug transportation accident
6 months ago? In-city transport method]

319
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,960
We were right.

320
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,280
These drug dealers

321
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,360
are selling both Red Dragon and meth.

322
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,320
But according to the police in Huazhou,

323
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,760
Hao sells everything

324
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,520
including ketamine, heroin, and ecstasy.

325
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,400
But he has never touched meth.

326
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,560
Where on earth is the supplier of meth?

327
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,600
The murder case

328
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
is basically solved.

329
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,520
Hao from Huazhou asked Chen Liang
to transport goods.

330
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
The boss in Halan

331
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,120
asked Song brothers
to pick up the goods.

332
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,240
The White Building was
the inspection point.

333
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,280
During the transaction,

334
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
there was a conflict.

335
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,200
Chen Liang committed murder

336
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
and ran away with the goods.

337
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,440
To protect the entire

338
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
Red Dragon

339
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,840
operation,

340
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,920
Chen Liang was also silenced.

341
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,800
The drug dealers in Huazhou
are all ruthless.

342
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,240
They can't bear

343
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
being tricked by their partners.

344
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,880
They are all afraid of getting killed
after being betrayed.

345
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
So, what they value the most
is credibility.

346
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,080
If word of this gets out,

347
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,680
they won't be able to operate
in the underworld anymore.

348
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
It's possible that the Song brothers

349
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,840
just wanted to keep
the goods for themselves.

350
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,960
They tried to deceive everyone

351
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,800
but ended up losing their lives.

352
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,320
These are all guesses.

353
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,120
Now, Chen Liang is dead.

354
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,360
So are Song Wen and Song Wu.

355
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,080
If we want to know the truth,

356
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
they can't tell us anything.

357
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,640
Erjin.

358
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,160
Erjin, I was wrong.

359
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,960
Erjin, I won't do it again.

360
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,640
I have to support my mother.

361
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
Erjin, give me a chance.

362
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,920
Erjin, I was wrong.

363
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Erjin, I beg you.

364
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,400
I beg you, Erjin.

365
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,800
Erjin, I was wrong.

366
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Song Wen and Song Wu were so bold.

367
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
They dared to steal the boss' goods.

368
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,160
It means they also stole the goods

369
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
that were lost last August.

370
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
So they were stabbed to death.

371
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,240
They deserve it.

372
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,960
What's wrong with you?

373
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,280
Are you tired of living?

374
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,000
Erjin.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,320
I was wrong.

376
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll be your dog from now on.

377
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
You can ask me to do anything.

378
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
I wasn't involved in their scheme
of double-crossing each other.

379
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,760
I just extorted some money from them.

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,960
I'll give you all the money
I've extorted.

381
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,720
Erjin.

382
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I beg you, Erjin.

383
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,680
I'll give you all the money.

384
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,680
Erjin.

385
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
Shut up!

386
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,640
Is this about money?

387
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
You broke the rules.

388
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
You deserve to die.

389
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,520
Si, punish him.

390
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,400
Erjin...

391
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Look carefully.

392
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,440
This is the price for betrayal.

393
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
Boss, what about the corpse?

394
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,880
Will it attract too much attention?

395
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
In Halan,

396
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,400
there's always someone who drowns
after a night of drinking.

397
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Si,

398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
throw his body out after.

399
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll swim here tomorrow.

400
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
That's nasty.

401
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,380
Okay.

402
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,680
We've solved everything

403
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
and handled everything.

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Hao,

405
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,240
rest assured.

406
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,920
After all, it happened

407
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
on my turf.

408
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
I have to give you an explanation.

409
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,800
Have you received my token of sincerity?

410
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,920
This token of sincerity
is truly valuable.

411
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,200
I heard you only accepted
pure gold gifts.

412
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,960
You are really too generous this time.

413
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
They say it's the thought that counts.

414
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,840
But I think that's nonsense.

415
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
Things without value

416
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,120
are not presentable.

417
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,120
You are decisive and keep your word.

418
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
No wonder you
firmly established yourself in Halan.

419
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,080
We can't use the train channel anymore.

420
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't worry.

421
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,920
I'll find a new channel
as soon as possible.

422
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,200
You know,

423
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
the situation is tense right now.

424
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,440
It's very hard to import Red Dragon.

425
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,280
The price has to be adjusted.

426
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,360
Also, I think the one percent profit
you mentioned

427
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
is too little.

428
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,600
I will definitely give a discount.

429
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,360
Thank you for reminding me.

430
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
You prioritized the bigger picture

431
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,160
and sacrificed your own guy.

432
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
Otherwise, Liang would not
have died so quickly.

433
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,700
[Seven days ago]

434
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,200
Liang just told me.

435
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,200
They wanted to play dirty with me.

436
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,840
Half a year ago, I lost my guy
and the goods.

437
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
If Liang wasn't alert today,

438
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,560
you would be doomed.

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Boss Qin, you are really
not trustworthy.

440
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
There must be a misunderstanding.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
If my guy

442
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,120
committed theft,

443
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I will give you an explanation.

444
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,720
What's most concerning is

445
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,680
that the police are hunting
your guy everywhere.

446
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,200
If he betrays us,

447
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,520
our whole channel will be exposed.

448
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,280
Hao,

449
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,160
give me a photo of Liang.

450
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,560
I'll handle this perfectly.

451
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,720
Then we can continue to make a fortune.

452
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,440
How about that?

453
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
Once Liang is dead,

454
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,400
this will become a mystery
without a lead.

455
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,640
I know what you are thinking.

456
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,080
You're afraid that if this gets out,

457
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,000
it will harm your reputation.

458
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
Hao,

459
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
we are in the same boat.

460
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,720
Liang is from Huazhou.

461
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,360
Once the police in Halan catch him

462
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,280
and send him back to your place
for interrogation,

463
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,520
a lot of your guys

464
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
will be busted.

465
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Hao, rest assured.

466
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,640
I'll check everything I should.

467
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,640
Next time I bring in goods, I'll give
you a one percent profit margin.

468
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,960
Hao, you just said

469
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,080
I was a man who kept my word.

470
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,920
One percent profit margin it is.

471
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,880
After the transportation channel
is established,

472
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
you can just tell Erjin.

473
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
Let's contact less often.

474
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,640
Let's go through this year

475
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,600
in peace.

476
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
Ming,

477
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,880
the new place will be open next month.

478
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Take it there for worship.

479
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Hao,

480
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,640
Qin Yi is very impolite.

481
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
Why do you want to worship
something he gave you?

482
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,640
In our line of work,

483
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
no one refuses gold.

484
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,280
Nor does anyone dare to Guan Yu.

485
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,240
The weather is weird today.

486
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,680
The rain just can't stop.

487
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:22,380
[Yifeng Taxi Company]

488
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,800
I tell you,

489
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,640
the drug dealers might be scared.

490
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
All the small pushers
retailing Red Dragon

491
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,640
stopped their operations overnight.

492
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,480
But these karaoke bars and discos

493
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,560
are still selling it.

494
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
I'll tell you one more time.

495
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,280
Our purpose of this visit

496
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,880
is to investigate and gather evidence.

497
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,800
Find the big pushers.

498
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,720
No one better mess this up.

499
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,120
We can't alert the enemy.

500
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
Don't make me lose my temper.

501
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,720
Here is your wine.

502
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,880
Put it here.

503
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,080
Happy.

504
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,360
Be happy.

505
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,120
Shake your body.

506
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,840
Don't sit so straight.

507
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,800
Come on.

508
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,400
Here is your dessert.

509
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,800
Okay.

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Please enjoy yourself.

511
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,720
Come on.

512
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
Tonight, there's plenty of Red Dragon.

513
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,880
Go all out.

514
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,800
Please enjoy.

515
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,400
Those guys wearing sunglasses,

516
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,240
are they the ones you said

517
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,080
fried their brains with drugs?

518
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,400
Wearing sunglasses at night...

519
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,200
After taking ecstasy, the pupils dilate.

520
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
They can't stand the light,
so they have to wear sunglasses.

521
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,680
We have to act the whole part.

522
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,600
I've brought two pairs.

523
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,720
Let me see.

524
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,640
The situation here is similar
to that in Huazhou.

525
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,400
You two look unfamiliar.

526
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
Are you enjoying yourselves?

527
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:27,920
Yes.

528
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,120
Should we get you a couple of girls?

529
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,720
Is there a private room

530
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,920
where we can talk?

531
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,800
Unfortunately,

532
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,520
all the private rooms
are fully booked today.

533
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,080
Well,

534
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,440
I'll keep one for you next time.

535
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,600
I'm really sorry.

536
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,960
Are there any precious things inside?

537
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,840
If it's broken, I'll compensate you.

538
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,360
Who asked you to open it?

539
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,800
Who asked you to open it?

540
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
What do you mean?

541
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,960
What do you mean?

542
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,200
I'm not done drinking yet.
Why rush the bill?

544
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
No.

545
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,920
Here. For the glass.

546
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,000
Take it.

547
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,680
Don't look at me. Get lost.

548
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,680
What are you doing?

549
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,720
We have to act the whole part.

550
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,120
When did you put the money in?

551
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,400
When we got off the car.

552
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,480
We only applied
for those stacks of tokens.

553
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,200
Only the top two are real,

554
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,920
and he took away one.

555
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,960
I have to pay

556
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,200
with my own money.

557
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,320
How about we...?

558
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,120
I have no money.

559
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,720
Done ordering?

560
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
Apart from these,

561
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
would you like something else?

562
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,160
Do you have any special recommendations?

563
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,960
No, no.

564
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,400
I was just asking.

565
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,520
I, um,

566
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
have a few buddies.

567
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
They will come later.

568
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,920
I'll order when they come.

569
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Okay.

570
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
Enjoy yourselves.

571
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
I'll place the order.

572
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,480
Go ahead.

573
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,960
- I want the beer to be very cold.
- Okay.

574
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,200
- Very very cold.
- No problem.

575
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,320
Go ahead.

576
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,720
With all these private room doors
shut tight,

577
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,440
we can't even check.

578
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,760
After the beer is sent here,

579
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,120
let's go out and take a stroll.

580
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,360
It's normal to go to other private rooms
when you're drunk.

581
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,240
Okay.

582
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't just sit. Too uptight.

583
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,800
Come up.

584
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
Look how they dance.

585
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,440
Shake your body along.

586
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,200
Shake your body.

587
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,400
Shake.

588
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,440
Yes, shake your head.

589
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,800
Yes, you're blending in.

590
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,600
The private rooms here

591
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,440
are probably designated
for regulars to party in.

592
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,960
We need to find a way to sneak in.

593
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
Zhao!

594
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,160
Make way.

595
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,840
Zhao!

596
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,680
Who are you?

597
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,040
Psycho.

598
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,720
Let's drink.

599
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
Get lost.

600
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Sorry.

601
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,240
Get out!

602
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,320
Wrong person.

603
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,080
Dizzy.

604
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,880
Wishing you lots of kids.

605
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,280
Ma.

606
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,200
I'm late.

607
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Ma, I've brought you some wine.

608
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,440
Come.

609
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
What are you doing?
Raise a glass to Mr. Ma.

610
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Hurry up.

611
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,120
Raise a glass.

612
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,880
Take it.

613
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
Mr. Ma, please have some wine.

614
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
Your hands are so soft.

615
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Let go!

616
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
Come on, take a sip.

617
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,280
I won't.

618
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
How you dare splash me!

619
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,000
Our purpose of this visit

620
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,840
is to investigate and gather evidence.

621
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,480
Find the big pushers.

622
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,640
No one better mess this up.

623
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,720
Don't alert the enemy.

624
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,520
Stop!

625
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
What are you doing?

626
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,480
What are you doing?

627
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,780
Wow, girl.

628
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,040
You're tough, huh?

629
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,320
I don't want to get physical today.

630
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,760
Come on! Get her!

631
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,720
Come here!

632
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Get her!

633
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,280
Bei, Mad Dog is fighting with others.

634
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
I can't stop her.

635
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,020
Come here.

636
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,440
Okay. Hurry up.

637
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
I'll hold off on the situation.

638
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Why are you here?

639
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,520
Are you okay?

640
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,240
Hey,

641
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,360
what are you doing?

642
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Everyone, I'm sorry.

643
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,360
My sister is drunk.

644
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,160
If she did something wrong,

645
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
don't take it to heart.

646
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,400
Please be understanding.

647
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
We're here

648
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
for fun, right?

649
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,200
Go away!

650
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,320
For what fun?

651
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,880
Which private room are you from?

652
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,280
We cater exclusively
to regular customers here.

653
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
How come I've never seen you two?

654
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,560
What are you doing here?

655
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,480
We are from

656
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,640
the room at the end, 501.

657
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,520
Room 501?

658
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,360
There is no 501 on the second floor.

659
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,760
You are a liar.

660
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,640
Security!

661
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,760
Security!

662
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,240
Hey,

663
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,080
let's settle this today.

664
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,840
It's no big deal,
but you called security.

665
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,600
I'm sorry.

666
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Let's go.

667
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,520
Go home with me.

668
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
No one can leave today!

669
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,560
- Come here.
- Come here.

670
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,360
Beat him!

671
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,120
Xueyao, stop fighting!

672
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Xiaoguang!

673
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,840
This is my turf,

674
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,560
and you did this to me?

675
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
That's crossing the line!

676
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,160
Do I get any respect around here?

677
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,240
Security!

678
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,680
Where are the security guards?

679
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,640
Security!

680
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,960
Beat her!

681
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,880
Beat her to death!

682
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,240
Kill her and I'll take the blame.

683
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Stop!

684
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,880
Stop fighting!

685
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,560
Squat down.

686
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,800
Mr. Xiong.

687
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,440
Mr. Xiong, they got drunk
and started a fight.

688
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,920
Arrest them!

689
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm exhausted.

690
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Xueyao, are you injured?

691
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Well,

692
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,040
Xueyao, tell me

693
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,400
what exactly happened.

694
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
We received a tip-off from the public

695
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,200
that there's prostitution
happening here.

696
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,000
We came to take a look

697
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,280
and happened to witness the manager
forcing someone into prostitution

698
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,760
and harming them.

699
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,800
It's a misunderstanding.

700
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,280
There is a girl upstairs.

701
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
There is one upstairs.

702
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,880
Upstairs.

703
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,840
Zhang, Ge,

704
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,520
go upstairs to take a look.

705
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,640
There is a girl upstairs.

706
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,240
Hurry up.

707
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
Take them all back.

708
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Go.

709
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,840
Move fast.

710
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Behave.

711
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,600
Bei,

712
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
Yao pulled an all-nighter
to get this information.

713
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,640
Take a look.

714
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,120
We used the anti-vice operation
as a cover

715
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
to get statements
from the karaoke staff.

716
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,680
We can now confirm

717
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,400
that the karaoke bar,
just like that nightclub,

718
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,360
is involved in
organized drug trafficking.

719
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,080
Their owner is the big pusher.

720
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,520
Bei,

721
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Yao stayed up all night

722
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,040
and put together the profiles

723
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,200
of the owners
of both entertainment venues.

724
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
There are photos here.

725
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,000
Continue with the visits
and collect evidence.

726
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
Visit all the entertainment venues
in Halan

727
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,800
that are involved with drugs.

728
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Don't mind other things.

729
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
I'll send people to follow the pushers.

730
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Go get busy.

731
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,000
Bei, you scolded her last night.

732
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
Yao knows she was wrong.

733
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Don't be mad.

734
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,360
What does it have to do with you?

735
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,680
What does it have to do with you?

736
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,600
If it weren't for Xiong

737
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,240
who was on duty nearby

738
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,280
and played along with you yesterday,

739
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
you would have been exposed.

740
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,360
Do you know that?

741
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
If we really alerted the pushers,

742
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,880
they would cancel all deals.

743
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,040
What would be left to investigate?

744
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,480
We'd have nothing to do.

745
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
I know I was wrong, Bei.

746
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
What's the use of that?

747
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,920
You know you are wrong every time.

748
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,960
You need to know

749
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,280
what to do when you see
the same thing happen again.

750
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
I just can't watch people being bullied.

751
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,200
I don't do what I can do.

752
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,760
My goodness.

753
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,440
Yao,

754
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,680
you are a grown-up now.

755
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,440
You should control your mood.

756
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,040
Otherwise, there will be a problem.

757
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,200
Can't you see

758
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,920
yesterday was a ready example?

759
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,040
You can't become the slave of your mood.

760
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,520
I tell you,

761
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,160
if you can't do it,

762
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,360
go back and continue with your matches.

763
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,160
You are not fit to be a cop.

764
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,680
Am I clear?

765
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
A bit too far.

766
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,360
Sorry, Bei.

767
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,400
Come back.

768
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,920
What are you doing?

769
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,680
Don't anyone try to comfort her.

770
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,000
Let her figure it out on her own.

771
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Uncle Wang.

772
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,760
Captain Zheng.

773
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,120
Well, has Yao come back?

774
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,680
I didn't see her.

775
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,680
Alright.

776
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,320
What happened?

777
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,560
Nothing.

778
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Gu, take care.

779
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,240
Today, we are visiting the bathhouses.

780
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,200
She picked the farthest place.

781
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,720
I guess she will come back at midnight.

782
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,680
If you are worried,

783
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,760
page her.

784
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
Ask her to tell you when she is back.

785
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,880
No need.

786
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,240
If something really happens,

787
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,840
the department will inform me.

788
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,440
Bei.

789
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,280
Are you playing the sympathy card here?

790
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,640
No.

791
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,720
I'm just

792
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,320
tired.

793
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,960
I just need to lie down for a while.

794
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,000
You're not angry with me anymore?

795
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
What's the use of being angry?

796
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,560
I picked you.

797
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
What can I do?

798
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,560
Next time something like this happens,

799
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,400
I'll hold off until you can handle it.

800
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,600
I swear.

801
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,280
Alright, let's not have a next time.

802
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,200
Let me tell you,

803
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,480
being a cop means

804
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,680
dealing with all kinds of situations.

805
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
But handling them

806
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,920
requires the right approach.

807
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,240
Acting on impulse gets you nowhere.

808
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,160
It's easy to be rash when you start out,

809
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
but the consequences of

810
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,080
that can backfire.

811
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,440
We're investigating these drug cases

812
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,320
to save more lives.

813
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
That's why you became a cop
in the first place.

814
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,000
Don't forget that.

815
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,400
Alright.

816
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Let me send you back home.

817
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
It's late. Your parents will be worried.

818
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
Take this. Eat it on the road.

819
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,960
Let's go.

820
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,600
Bei,

821
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
what would you do

822
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,800
if you were in that situation?

823
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,760
Not saving the person in front of us?

824
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,880
That's not true.

825
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,200
But you can't rush in and beat them up,

826
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,640
right?

827
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,720
You can't expose yourself.

828
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
You need to find a way around.

829
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
You can cut the power, right?
