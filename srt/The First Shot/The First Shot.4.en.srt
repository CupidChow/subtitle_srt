of this half print,

I reconstructed the outline
of the entire print.

According to my reconstruction,

00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,980
the shoe size isn't 42.

144

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,580
Right.

192
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,860
Did you see it?

193
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,820
Yes.

194
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,740
When did they arrive at the factory?

195
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,900
At 11:40 PM.

196
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,020
That's very specific.

197
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,740
I checked my watch.

198
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,260
Then what happened?

199
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,540
They got out of the car

200
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,940
and went straight
into the white building.

201
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,020
All three of them got out

202
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,500
and went into the white building?

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes.

204
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,300
And then?

205
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,500
Then they went into Room 505.

206
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,500
What did they do afterward?

207
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,420
I was hiding in the corridor,

208
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,620
and I heard them arguing inside.

209
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,620
After a while, it sounded
like a fight broke out.

210
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,340
Jiang Xiaohai.

211
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,860
The room had gone quiet by then.

212
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,860
Help me.

213
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,340
Help.

214
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,900
Then I heard...

215
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,700
Help.

216
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Song Wen's voice.

217
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I failed to hold on to him

218
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,540
even though I used all my strength.

219
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,740
Why didn't you tell us
about this last time?

220
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,140
If I had,

221
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,540
you...

222
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,500
you would've thought
I was one of the killers.

223
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,460
Look,

224
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,980
here's a new file.

225
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,620
I'm so thirsty.

226
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,620
But there isn't any water.

227
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,780
So this guy witnessed the whole thing.

228
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,060
Why didn't he call the police?

229
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,060
He said he was scared
and didn't want any trouble.

230
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,580
You should've seen him.
I couldn't stand him.

231
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,260
This family we visited
lives on the north side

232
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,500
of the staff residential compound,
on the fourth floor,

233
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,380
so they had a clear view
of the back of the white building.

234
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,900
Did both he and his wife
see what happened?

235
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,100
Yes.

236
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,980
Guess what?

237
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,020
The guy got up to pee at midnight

238
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,580
and saw Song Wen
hanging outside the window,

239
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,460
about to lose his grip.

240
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Then he saw Jiang Xiaohai rush over

241
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,940
and grab Song Wen.

242
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,180
And then?

243
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,500
Then

244
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,020
comes the crazy part.

245
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,940
The guy watched the whole thing,

246
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,020
and instead of calling the police,

247
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,740
he brought his wife over

248
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,220
to "enjoy the show."

249
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Looks like Jiang Xiaohai
didn't lie this time.

250
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,260
He held on to Song Wen for a while.

251
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Then the power went out,

252
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,700
and then Song Wen fell off.

253
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,740
Did they witness the entire fight?

254
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,380
How can we be sure

255
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,500
that Jiang Xiaohai
wasn't involved in the fight?

256
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,460
I've got all the forensic evidence.

257
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,460
The murder weapon wasn't cleaned.

258
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Only the killer's,
Song Wen's, and Song Wu's

259
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,700
fingerprints are on it.

260
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,820
Back at the Major Crimes Unit's office,

261
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,860
I had Sun tail Jiang Xiaohai
for a few days.

262
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,260
We also checked
his household registration records.

263
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,580
Nothing unusual came up.

264
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,820
So how do we categorize what he did?

265
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,140
A failed attempt at heroism?

266
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,100
That,

267
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,980
and withholding information
from the police.

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,620
Let him go.

269
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,620
Report this to Mr. Gao,

270
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,660
and see if a lecture is needed.

271
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,940
Either way, it's no longer our concern.

272
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,580
Something's off here, Bei.

273
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,380
What we initially hypothesized

274
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,460
at the crime scene

275
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,860
was that the murderer
pushed Song Wen off the building,

276
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,540
killing him,

277
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,140
and then stabbed Song Wu to death

278
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,060
before escaping down the fire escape.

279
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,260
But now it seems

280
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,380
that when Jiang Xiaohai arrived,

281
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,700
Song Wen was still alive.

282
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Would the killer really run off
without making sure he was dead?

283
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,020
I just reviewed the footprint analysis.

284
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,860
The killer's steps were uneven,

285
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,340
and the strides were irregular.

286
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,140
This suggests he was either exhausted

287
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,300
or already injured.

288
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,580
So even if he saw Song Wen hanging there
when he reached the ground,

289
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,940
he probably wouldn't have gone back.

290
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,980
That makes sense.

291
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,080
[Jianpeng General Store]

292
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
[Halan Public Security Bureau]

293
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,260
The murderer

294
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,700
must be on the run now.

295
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,500
I've already sent people
to the major intersections

296
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,060
to check everyone passing by.

297
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,860
Now, we wait.

298
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,740
All the drug money was left
at the white building.

299
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,460
If he wants to find a place to hide,

300
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,220
the quickest way

301
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,180
is to sell the drugs he has for money.

302
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,060
Being new to this place,

303
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,220
he's unlikely to sell them in bulk.

304
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,140
Instead, he'll probably
split them into small packs

305
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,140
and cash them out quickly.

306
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,340
Guozhu,

307
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,900
Guozhu!

308
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,740
What are you doing?
Are you even listening?

309
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,780
We're having a meeting here.

310
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,180
Why are you staring at that sausage?

311
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,500
Is that Yuedong guy
in there or something?

312
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Maybe he really is.

313
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,660
Just eat it! What nonsense.

314
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,220
Gosh.

315
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,060
Listen.

316
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,180
The local police station received

317
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,620
a call from a store owner.

318
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,060
The tech team went there
and lifted two fingerprints,

319
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
but they didn't take them seriously.

320
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,780
They thought it was from someone
who had a nosebleed

321
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,980
and accidentally smeared the surface.

322
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,260
But these two fingerprints look
increasingly familiar to me.

323
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,780
I think they belong to the Yuedong guy.

324
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,660
That would be too much of a coincidence.

325
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,660
You're trying too hard
to crack the case.

326
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,140
The odds are...

327
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,020
The Yuedong guy has a distinctive whorl
on his middle finger

328
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
and unique loops on his thumb.

329
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,780
I paid special attention to them.

330
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,180
I have a habit of using
objects around me

331
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,460
to remember fingerprint patterns.

332
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,660
To me, the folds of this rye bread

333
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,780
and this sausage

334
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,980
look just like his fingerprints.

335
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Let me see.

336
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,900
Look,

337
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,300
the curves go upward to the right.

338
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,100
Rye bread and a sausage?

339
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,540
You technicians
have such a unique way of thinking.

340
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,460
Do they really resemble fingerprints?

341
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,220
They do! Look closer!

342
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,900
See the curvature?

343
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,700
Hey, don't eat my evidence!

344
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
What evidence?

345
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,620
Bei, she ate my evidence!

346
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,300
Can you two stop bickering

347
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,740
like kids?

348
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,460
Why do you have to eat his sausage?

349
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,180
This is meat,

350
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,420
and I'm hungry.

351
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,180
Where is that store located?

352
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,700
Near Boiler Plant
No. 2 Elementary School.

353
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,060
Near that school, huh?

354
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,420
That's indeed
not far from the glass factory.

355
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,860
Not far at all.

356
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,100
If he left

357
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,180
the glass factory and headed north,

358
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,460
he'd reach the lumberyard, right?

359
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,340
Then he might have passed by that store
on his way downtown.

360
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,940
Go compare the fingerprints.

361
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,300
Very impressive, Ding Guozhu.

362
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,940
You've got sharp eyes.

363
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,940
These really are
the killer's fingerprints.

364
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,180
See?

365
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,980
The match is crystal clear.

366
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,660
These fingerprints

367
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
have helped us narrow down
the search area,

368
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,660
saving us a lot of time.

369
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,780
Our team is really

370
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,660
full of talent.

371
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,660
Bei, you've got
to buy us dinner tonight.

372
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,020
I've treated you to dinner
eight times this month,

373
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,980
and you still want more?

374
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,860

Tell me what I can buy you guys.

376
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,180
Just joking.

377
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I just wanted to express

378
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
how thrilled I was.

379
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,220
Give some to Mr. Gu.

380

I'm good. Thanks.

381

My dad made this himself.

382
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,500
It's super tasty. Have a try.

Try some.

The coating on popcorn machines
contains lead.

386
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,700
Eating too much popcorn
can lead to chronic lead poisoning,

387
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,260
which damages
the nervous and digestive systems.

388
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,220
I suggest you cut back on it too.

389

I've been eating it since I was a kid,

Mr. Gu is just concerned
about your health.

394
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,740
Why are you getting so upset?

395
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Mr. Gu, don't worry about it.

396
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,540
He won't be here for long.

397
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,180
Just ignore him.

398
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,420
Alright.

Come on. Eat up.

Alright, enough with the digression.

and start a search

407

within a five-kilometer radius.

[Arcade]

409
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,060
Drug dealers prefer

410
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,100
to sell drugs in places
where all sorts of people gather,

411
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,780
such as arcades, pool halls,

412
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,140
skating rinks, karaoke bars,
and dance halls.

413

So what's the plan?

421
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Are you joining us
for the on-site investigation?

422
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,660
My paperwork just went through.

I'm officially part
of the special investigation team now.

424

It went through?

425
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,300
Great.

Then let me give you

427
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,660
your first lesson
in on-site investigation today.

428
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,860
Lesson one:

429
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,020
Stop acting like this.

430
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,220
You're too tense.

431
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,820
Move around.

432
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,540
Dance a bit.

433
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,620
Dance, see?

434
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,100
What should I do?

435
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,140
Drink and dance.

Lesson two:

Never drink on the job.

I just filled it
with tap water in the restroom.

443
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,140
Sedimentation and filtration alone
can't purify tap water.

444
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,140
Chlorine dioxide is required too.

445
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,260
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,340
Just make do with it for now.

447
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,140

448

I'll go chat with someone.

449
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,820
Is he the guy from the Pattaya Hotel?

450
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,260
He's got a lot of info.

452
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,460

of anyone selling small packs of meth.

456

A stranger has been selling
Red Dragon on the down-low.

458
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,820
Is he from the south?

459

I'm not sure.

460
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,460
I haven't met him.

461
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,820
Find out where this guy

462
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,780
has been.

463
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,940
Keep an eye on him,

464
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,620
and report back to me with anything new.

465
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,860
I'll definitely keep an eye out

Bei, how about a dance with me?

469

Biao,

470
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,700

471

Bro, that chain of yours is dope.

472
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,740
Do you think I'd look cool wearing it,

473
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,340
like one of those gangsters?

474
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,980
This is a genuine piece
of Hong Kong merchandise.

475
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,420
It's 24k gold.

476

I can give you a receipt
for reimbursement.

486
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,900
Just tell me how much you want on it.

487

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,540
Hello?

560
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Hello, Zheng Bei.

561
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Near Zhenxing Road,

562
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,460
someone reported

563
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,060
he had spotted
a suspicious out-of-towner.

564
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,740
Okay, got it.

565
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,700
Got it.

566
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm on my way.

567
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,540
How much do you sell it for?

568
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
I don't sell it. It's for myself.

569
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,540
You finished those two packs
from yesterday already?

570
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,220
Give me one more pack, man.

571
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,260
No money, no goods.

572
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,060
I think it's this building.

573
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,620
Are you sure he's from Yuedong?

574
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,780
He sounded like it.

575
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,380
He bought breakfast from me yesterday.

576
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,820
Anyway, I'm sure he's from the south.

577
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,700
Do you know which entrance he uses?

578
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,420
Yeah.

579
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,380
Come on, I'll show you.

580
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,540
Great.

581
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,820
My friends and I are members
of the residents' committee.

582
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
We always patrol the area

583
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,500
after packing up at night

584
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,500
and keep an eye out

585
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,700
for strangers.

586
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,580
That's so selfless of you.

587
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,820
It's nothing,

588
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,340
just part of our duties.

589
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,820
You're the ones who handle
the real troublemakers.

590
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:20,980
Right.

591
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:21,940
Is it this way?

592
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,700
I think so.

593
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
It's the second entrance.

594
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,620
That one?

595
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,740
I saw him go in there.

596
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,500
Okay, got it.

597
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,380
Thank you so much.

598
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,820
Let me give you a hand.

599
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,580
It's alright.

600
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,380
I got this.

601
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,060
There you go.

602
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,300
Go ahead and do your job.

603
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,900
Thank you.

604
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,820
No problem.

605
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:52,900
Give it to me!

606
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,300
- Give it to me!
- It's mine!

607
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Give it to me!

608
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,100
What's going on here?

609
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,620
Stop fighting!

610
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,100
Don't move!

611
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,180
Drop the knife!

612
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,900
Drop it!

613
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,460
Let go!

614
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Stop running!

615
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Are you insane?

616
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
What's going on?

617
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,740
Stay back!

618
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,740
Uncle!

619
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,660
Drop the knife.

620
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,620
Drop the knife!

621
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,380
Stay back!
Come any closer, and I'll kill her!

622
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,940
Uncle!

623
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,540
Step back!

624
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,580
Step back!

625
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,740
If you don't, I'll kill her!

626
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,340
Let her go. I won't go after you.

627
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,220
Back off!

628
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,420
Uncle.
