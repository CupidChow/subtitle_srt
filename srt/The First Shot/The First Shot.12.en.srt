Don't you look down on me.

376
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
It's a new lock.

377
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
Is breaking and entering
your side hustle?

378
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,480
How can you say that?

379
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Bei and I often carry out
secret search missions.

380
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,960
It's an essential skill.

381
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,840
How about

382
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
I give you a lesson tomorrow?

383
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
I don't go on solo missions.

384
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,280
As long as you guys know, it's fine.

385
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,320
More skills, less burden.

386
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,240
You said it yourself, "Live and learn."

387
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,920
Ran,

388
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,820
Ran,

389
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,160
look at this.

390
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,680
The sausage here smells even better
than Uncle's.

391
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,560
Smell it.

392
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Be quiet.

393
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,280
You've got the nose of a sniffer dog.

394
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,960
These barrels seem newly brought in.

395
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Ran.

396
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,960
Take this.

397
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
I'll go get half a catty of liquor,

398
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,560
would you join me?

399
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,400
Okay.

400
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,640
Should we climb over the wall to leave?

401
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,840
If that dog keeps barking like this,

402
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
it'll draw him over for sure.

403
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,320
What's all this noise?

404
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,960
Don't come over. Don't.

405
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,320
Where did you find the sausage?

406
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,640
You just couldn't resist, could you? Go.

407
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
Chao, come over here.

408
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,360
My sausage ended up
being a treat to the dog.

409
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,080
What a waste.

410
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
You just couldn't resist, could you?

411
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,520
Let's go.

412
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,160
What's that sound?

413
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Go check it out.

414
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Quickly, Ran.

415
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,280
Are you okay?

416
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,560
What are you doing?

417
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm telling you,

418
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,000
stay away from Nan, do you hear me?

419
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,760
Or I'll kill you.

420
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,400
Do you hear me?

421
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
It irritates me to hear you say it.

422
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,280
You think Nan is someone you can have?

423
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,560
You better go back to Huazhou.

424
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,320
Understand?

425
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
If you dare to lay a finger on Nan,

426
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,880
I'll smash your glasses into pieces.
Understand?

427
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,080
Gosh! How dare you!

428
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
Come on, stab me here.

429
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,160
If you've got the guts, stab me here.
Come on!

430
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,460
Gosh.

431
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,200
Drunkards.

432
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,120
Come on.

433
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,920
Come on, stab me here.

434
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,120
Show some guts, stab me here. Come on!

435
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,160
Come on.

436
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Give it a go.

437
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,880
Can you at least let me know next time
before you start acting?

438
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
The liquor is already stale.

439
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,560
Let's get out of here, quickly.

440
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,760
You're back.

441
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Yeah.

442
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Are you going to take a bath, Li?

443
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,640
Yeah.

444
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,400
Why aren't you going back?

445
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,480
Looking for Zheng Bei?

446
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,240
You're back.

447
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,480
How did it go?

448
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Got it all recorded.

449
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
What's wrong?
Got something on your mind?

450
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
Nan isn't here?

451
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,240
She hasn't come back.

452
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
She went to the hospital
to see her friend.

453
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,760
It is so late now.

454
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,080
It's dangerous to walk at night.

455
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
I should go pick her up.

456
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,360
No need to pick her up.

457
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,680
She told me she was staying over

458
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
at Zhen's place

459
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,880
for the night.

460
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,520
She's not coming back today.

461
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
Are Xiaoguang and Zheng Nan
having a falling out?

462
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,680
Who knows what's going on between them?

463
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
Because of what happened
at the hospital?

464
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't know what to say.

465
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Look at him,

466
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,200
so silly.

467
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,720
I actually wanted to help him,

468
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,280
but who knew it'd turn out like this?

469
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,520
Having you as their elder brother
is really something.

470
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
What does it have to do with me?

471
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,120
It's him who can't keep his cool.

472
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680
He just spilled his guts like that.

473
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,640
What can I do?

474
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,800
Oh, come on.

475
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,920
When you first got that news
about Zheng Nan,

476
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
didn't you lose your composure, too?

477
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,840
The pot calling the kettle black.

478
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,200
That's my sister.

479
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
How can I not worry?

480
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,160
What?

481
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
Did you drink?

482
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Thanks for the reminder.

483
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah, my head had a good drink.

484
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,520
Well.

485
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,800
Having evidence is a good thing.

486
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,960
Consider this your celebration drink.

487
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,560
It smells disgusting.

488
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Do you need me to wash your hair?

489
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,500
[Halan Public Security Bureau]

490
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,780
We've now confirmed

491
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,900
that Changlai Restaurant

492
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,220
is Qin Yi's new drug warehouse.

493
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,260
Be very careful.

494
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,740
Don't alert the enemy,

495
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,900
or he'll move again.

496
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,780
Understood?

497
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,620
Understood.

498
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,140
Did you hear that,

499
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,260
Xiaoguang?

500
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,020
Yes.

501
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,060
Any updates from Erjin?

502
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,380
Nothing new at the moment.

503
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Yao,

504
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,060
those pushers you're following,

505
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,700
did you find out
where they opened the packages?

506
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,220
I'm still following up, no news yet.

507
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,220
Alright, let's go eat now.

508
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,380
What's up? What's so funny?

509
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,420
Interesting.

510
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,860
What's interesting?

511
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,980
Normally, you Northeastern folks
are so straightforward,

512
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,820
but when it comes to matters
of the heart,

513
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,460
you get all shy and awkward.

514
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,820
The contrast is striking.

515
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,100
Interesting.

516
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,100
So, you're saying

517
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,340
Xiaoguang should
take the initiative, right?

518
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,460
Yes or no, just ask her.

519
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,340
The sooner the better.

520
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,200
My goodness.

521
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,380
You look so gentle and scholarly,
wearing glasses.

522
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,900
But when it comes to this,
you're so intense.

523
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,920
Well,

524
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,580
Yuedong folks are indeed
more open than us.

525
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,820
I've seen your movies,
always full of kissing scenes.

526
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,700
If you really want Xiaoguang to be
your brother-in-law,

527
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,420
you've got to help him out.

528
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,340
That way, he can focus on his work.

529
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,660
What can I do?

530
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,740
My sister has her own personality.

531
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,260
If he can win her heart,
that's his ability.

532
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,140
If not,

533
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,460
no one else can help.

534
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,820
Are you concerned about Xiaoguang

535
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
or his work?

536
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm concerned about both, okay?

537
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,700
What are you talking about?

538
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,740
What are you concerned about?

539
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,220
Who's winning whose heart?

540
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,900
We're concerned about the drug dealers.

541
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,820
Don't always fool me.

542
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,020
You think all I do
as a logistics officer

543
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,660
is feed your stomach?

544
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,980
Director Gao said

545
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,220
that during the May Day holiday,

546
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,500
the Public Security
and Education Department

547
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,660
will hold a big event.

548
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,620
We'll help you find a partner

549
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,580
and settle your marriage.

550
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,540
Sounds good,

551
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,020
right?

552
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,780
Mr. Gu,

553
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,900
you should find a girlfriend, too.

554
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,220
After this case is solved,

555
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,460
you can bring a Halan girl
back to Huazhou.

556
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,380
That would be impressive.

557
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm good.

558
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,780
Stop pretending.

559
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,340

Stop blaming yourself.

he thought something had happened to me

that I not only have an elder brother

that way.

Just the thought of it feels like
the sky is falling.

There's no way we could ever be dating.

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,080
I'm different from you.

747
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,320
How are you different? What's different?

748
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,520
You're

749
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,600
so promising.

750
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,800
I...

751
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,680
I don't have a degree.

752
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,880
And I have a record.

753
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,320
You think too much.

754
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,920
So what if you have a record?

755
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,800
So what if you have a record?

756
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm a cop,

757
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,960
I've seen so many people with a record.

758
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,960
So what?

759
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,920
As long as you correct your mistakes,

760
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,640
and in the future,

761
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,480
don't make them again,

762
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,960
who can laugh at you?

763
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,320
Listen to me,

764
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,600
if you don't mind,

765
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,640
my old man's opening a new branch.

766
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,680
He needs people.

767
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,840
If you're willing...

768
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,320
If you're willing,

769
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,680
on my word,

770
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
you can start working tomorrow.

771
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,080
Don't need anything else.

772
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,000
Do you get me?

773
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,720
Just go, okay?

774
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,520
Live clean, that's it.

775
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,440
Right, Bro?

776
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,160
Listen to me.

777
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,280
Cheers.

778
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,400
No more.

779
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,600
No more beers?

780
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,040
I'll get another two bottles.

781
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,320
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

782
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,200
I'll go.

783
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,480
You sit here.

784
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,760
Don't move.

785
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,320
Don't run around.

786
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,680
Wait for me,

787
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,360
I'll be right back.

788
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,600
Here.
