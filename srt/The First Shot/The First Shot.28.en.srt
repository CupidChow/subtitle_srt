00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,160
Jiang Xiaohai was imprisoned in Zhanzhou

5
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,320
for maliciously injuring someone.

6
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,120
The victim

7
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
was Liang Jiaju's father.

8
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
So, these two have known

9
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,440
each other since 1990.

10
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
That's crazy.

South and North,
thousands of kilometers apart.

12
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,680
Why did Jiang Xiaohai go to Zhanzhou?

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,600
And by chance,

14
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,040
hurt Liang Jiaju's father?

15
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
What's going on between these two?

16
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
That's not the point.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
The point is

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Jiang Xiaohai
seriously injured Liang Jiaju's father,

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
yet they still dealt drugs together.

20
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,280
It seems they are pretty close.

21
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,480
What really happened between them?

22
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,880
We'll only know

23
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
once they're caught.

24

Yesterday's operation was a success.

27

All weapons were confiscated.

28
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800

Lucifer Group is stockpiling weapons,

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
likely for their next drug operation.

34

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
That batch of guns was seized.

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
The police will think
we're low on firepower.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
That's actually a good thing.

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Our stockpile is still decent,

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,080

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
Our cards are on the table.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Do you think Zheng Bei
has a chance of winning?

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
It's hard to say.

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
But it doesn't look promising.

He hasn't made a move yet,

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,040
which means he lacks evidence.

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,760
He's still waiting

50
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,440

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,680
The next shipment is scheduled
on 19th October.

52
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,960
If we proceed as planned,

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,080
the police might take actions,

54
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
and we could get caught.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
But if we cancel it,

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,280
we'll lose

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
all our investment,

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920

Even if we stop now,

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
do you think he'll spare us?

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
In gambling,

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,360
the key is knowing

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,880
your opponent's cards.

66
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,440
If we can figure out what he's got,

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
no matter how strong his cards are,

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,040
we can make him lose.

there are

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
two possibilities.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
One, Zheng Bei is bluffing.

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
But with his skills,

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,920
he'll dig up more evidence.

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
Until then, we must stay calm

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
and continue with our plan.

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,280
Once this deal is done,
we'll leave Halan.

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
The second possibility is that

80
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,920
Zheng Bei already has a winning hand.

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
But our best move

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
is not to give up,

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,680
but to make him believe

84
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,160
we're still playing.

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
In fact, we're almost out.

86
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,040
After this, Zheng Bei will

87
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
watch you and Mr. Ma closely.

88
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,640
Is it too risky to proceed as usual?

89
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,520
Yingzi,

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,000
has Mr. Ma ever failed?

91
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
He won't this time either.

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
It's indeed a gamble,

93
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
but we make

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,480
the rule

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
and choose the time.

96
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
You want to change the schedule?

97
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
We don't know how much
Zheng Bei has uncovered.

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,600
Mr. Ma suggests

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
preparing for the worst-case scenario.

100
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
Let's assume they know

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
the exact timing

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,760
of our next shipment,

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
and the route we'll take.

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,720
This route crosses
from Halan to Sheng City.

105
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,440
For the police, that means
a joint operation between both cities.

106
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,680
In that case,

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
we'll move ahead of schedule.

108
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
A slow bird should make an early start.

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,080
The original plan was on 19th October.

110
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,200
We'll now move on the 12th.

111
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,280
Even if the two police forces
work together,

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,680
the ones in Sheng City

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
can't be here a week in advance.

114
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
The 12th is the weekend.

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Even if Halan police suspect anything,

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,280
they'll be short-staffed,

117
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,400
and unable to make it.

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320
Also,

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,320
the twelfth October

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,560

How so?

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,560
That day is Zheng Bei's father's
60th birthday.

124
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,800
Zheng Bei's colleagues and superiors

125
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,720
will come to celebrate.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
When the police let their guard down,

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
it's time

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
for us to move.

129
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
Have Bai Ling contact the towel factory,

130
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
and make sure all the towels
for the next shipment

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
are done before the 12th.

132
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Mr. Ma will give the factory

133
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,480
a foreign trade order
for exporting overseas.

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,480
Even if Zheng Bei investigates
the factory's overnight work,

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,040
he won't find any issues.

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
All of this assumes

137
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320

No unfamiliar faces in sight.

No signs from the Wanhuang either.

142
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
So, it's likely

143
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
that Zheng Bei is still clueless,

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,040
unable to untangle the threads.

145
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
If that's the case,

146
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,360

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,280
how's Liang Jiaju going?

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
He mostly stays at the company,

151
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,160
goes to and from work

153
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
We've been following him for days,

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,480
but still don't know where he lives.

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,880
He often goes

156
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
to the Drug Manufacturing Factory.

157
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,200
I suspect he lives there.

Guozhu and I

159
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
checked Jiang Xiaohai's accounts.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,160
There's no financial link between him

161
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,440
and Liang Jiaju or his company.

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680
Either Jiang Xiaohai

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
has an account under a fake ID,

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
or they deal in cash.

165
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
Another possibility is

166
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
they use an overseas account.

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
With the amount of drugs involved,

168
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
the drug money is massive.

169

Cash transactions

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
seem unlikely.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,560
Liang Jiaju studied abroad

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
and runs a foreign trade company,

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,160
so an overseas account
is highly probable.

174
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
And it reminds us

175
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,240
that we must capture them alive.

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,080
I checked their electricity usage

191
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,640
with the power company.

192

Hello, who is this?

197
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
It's me, Zheng.

198
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,960
Will that batch of towels

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,280

200

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
we're good here, no outsiders around.

203
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Go ahead and talk.

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,840
No big deal.

205
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I just wanted to check

206
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,080
if you guys are busy.

207
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
I noticed you've been working late.

208
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,000
Business is tough lately.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,960
We took an urgent order,

210
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,400
and they're paying well,

211
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,720
so we accepted.

212
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,520
Is something going on?

213
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
We're working with the police,

214
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,680
but no one said we couldn't do business.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Nothing.

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
We're just asking.

217
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,960
So, the Wanhuang order

218
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
is still on schedule, right?

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
Yes, we're still working on it.

220
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
If anything changes,

221
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
I'll let you know immediately.

222
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
Alright now.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,680
Thank you.

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760

We'll take good care of them for you.

229

Please, don't hurt my family.

324
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200

Look at him.

346

349
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,880
That's the serious business.

350
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,000
We'll all go.

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,680
I've never been there.

352
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Let's drop the formalities.

353
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Just enjoy his treat.

354
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
You're never sheepish, huh?

355
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,040
Why would I be?

356
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,400
He's not. Why should we be?

357
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
Look,

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Xiaoguang is doing more for Nan

359
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,560
than your own son.

360
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,720
Isn't that right?

361
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520

make him a part of our family?

366

369

373
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
Right. Your agreement doesn't count.

374
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
What matters
is whether my sister agrees.

375
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,640
Get the cake, go.

376
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay.

377
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
Help me, would you?

378
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,720
Can't carry it on your own?

379
