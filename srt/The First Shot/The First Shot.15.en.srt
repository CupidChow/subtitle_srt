00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,680
You're welcome.

383
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,560
When did Lv come out?

384
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,320
Over a month ago.

385
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
Look. He has gained some weight.

386
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,840
Yes.

387
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,880
I came to thank you

388
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,200
after this chicken grew fat.

389
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,360
Officer Zheng,

390
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
we rural people are poor.

391
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
We have nothing good.

392
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,040
I hope you like it.

393
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,480
I raised this chicken by myself.

394
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,160
Please take it.

395
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,120
Madam,

396
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,920
we have rules.

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,640
We can't accept gifts.

398
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,720
Besides, we did nothing special.

399
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,200
That was what we should do.

400
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
Everyone would do the same.

401
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,640
We police should serve the people.

402
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,640
It's nothing.

403
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,560
Sit down.

404
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,080
Give them water.

405
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,600
Come on.

406
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
Put it aside.

407
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,440
Pour some water.

408
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,080
Take a seat.

409
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,760
Here.

410
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,600
Madam, you came all the way here.

411
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,560
That was not easy.

412
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Lv,

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
let me tell you.

414
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
You have to be good to your grandma.

415
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,960
She is so concerned about you.

416
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,880
Xiaoguang, drive my car later

417
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
to take them home.

418
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
Go to my home on the way.

419
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,840
Let my mom

420
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
give them some sausages

421
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,920
she just made.

422
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,800
Officer Zheng,

423
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,400
you're so kind.

424
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
We came to thank you.

425
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
We can't trouble you.

426
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,680
It's okay.

427
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,880
The sausages my mom made

428
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,560
are very tasty.

429
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Take them back and have a try.

430
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,120
Uncle.

431
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,720
You came all the way here.
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

432
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,920
Come on.

433
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,960
Kid, have some.

434
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,240
You came just in time.

435
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,320
The buns are ready.

436
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Let me take it.

437
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,160
The buns are nice.

438
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Eat some, madam.

439
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,800
We made the buns ourselves.

440
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,920
He eats so quickly.

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Slow down.

442
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,360
Slow down.

443
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,280
Slow down.

444
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,560
Slow down, or you'll choke on it.

445
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
This kid.

446
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,720
Slow down.

447
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,760
Slow down.

448
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,640
Slow down.

449
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,160
You didn't have breakfast either, right?

450
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,960
Uncle, give him some porridge.

451
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,800
Okay, wait a second.

452
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,440
Don't go over there. It's crowded.

453
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,600
Don't move.

454
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,920
We're leaving, Officer Zheng.

455
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,800
Take care.

456
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,680
- We're leaving.
- Take care.

457
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,520
Don't forget to pick up the sausages
from my home.

458
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,440
Rest assured.

459
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,840
Just go back.

460
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,240
This way, madam.

461
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,320
This way.

462
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,920
That boy ate a lot.

463
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
Only three buns are left.

464
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,640
It's okay. There are more here.

465
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
My back is sore.

466
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
What do you mean, Bei?

467
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
What do you mean?

468
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,960
Did you not find out?

469
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,360
Yes.

470
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Why did you stop me then?

471
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,240
They came so early

472
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,280
to thank us with gifts.

473
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,640
It's not appropriate
to catch her grandson in front of her.

474
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,560
Not appropriate?

475
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
Officer Zheng.

476
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,520
Officer Zheng,

477
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,640
a drug addict

478
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,560
ate breakfast at the desk
of Special Investigation Team

479
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,600
and left.

480
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
And you're telling me

481
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
it's not appropriate to catch him.

482
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,080
I'll do it if you feel embarrassed.

483
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,800
I can play the bad guy
if you don't want to.

484
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Why are you so grumpy?

485
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,160
You don't know about his family.

486
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,760
That madam is unlucky.

487
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,680
Her son and daughter-in-law

488
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,240
worked in a factory

489
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,200
and died in an accident.

490
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
She and her grandson
live alone together.

491
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,200
She takes care of her grandson.

492
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,960
She set off before dawn

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
and took a bus here

494
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
happily

495
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
just to tell us the good news.

496
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,560
If you had caught
her grandson at that time,

497
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
she would think

498
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,280
she had sent her grandson

499
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,680
to the public security bureau.

500
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,960
She would have gone crazy.

501
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
If she had fainted here,

502
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,920
who could take the responsibility?

503
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
You?

504
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Yes.

505
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
The truth is cruel.

506
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,960
It will hurt
some innocent and kind people.

507
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,040
But tell me

508
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
who will take the responsibility

509
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
if he hurts

510
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,960
innocent people

511
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,160
after taking drugs.

512
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,040
Don't worry.

513
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,400
I've made arrangements.

514
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,920
I know what I'm doing.

515
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
I told Xiaoguang

516
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,360
to have someone tail him.

517
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
When that madam is not there,

518
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
we'll catch Lv.

519
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
I won't let them go.

520
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,720
But we have to show a little humanity.

521
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,440
Lv will go to jail

522
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,640
sooner or later.

523
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
That madam will have
to face this bad news.

524
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,680
People have lost their humanity

525
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,840
since the first day they took drugs, Bei!

526
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
If he were a drug dealer,

527
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,680
I would have caught him on the spot

528
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,680
without anyone reminding me.

529
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,920
This is different.

530
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,040
It's a kid.

531
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Not even an adult.

532
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,080
He took drugs
because the drug dealers lured him.

533
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,640
They tempted him

534
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,840
to take drugs.

535
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,360
He didn't
take the initiative to do that.

536
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,040
That's different.

537
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,000
Kid?

538
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
He's not a little boy.

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,920
He's already 16 or 17.

540
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,520
He's almost an adult.

541
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
He knew those were drugs,

542
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,240
but he was tempted to take them.

543
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,280
Then he is responsible for his actions.

544
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,400
You...

545
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
It's easy for you to say this.

546
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,080
You haven't experienced this.

547
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
If you don't understand, forget it.

548
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Let's not talk about it.

549
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,480
No, Bei,

550
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,080
let me tell you.

551
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
You're an anti-drug police officer.

552
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,960
This is Special Investigation Team.

553
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
Now that you are so soft-hearted

554
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
as to consider his family's feelings

555
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,280
when you catch a drug dealer

556
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,200
or a drug addict,

557
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,040
you don't deserve
to be an anti-drug police officer!

558
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,960
If you hate this,

559
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
go back to teaching in Huazhou.

560
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,800
I don't need you to teach me what to do!

561
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,760
Sorry to bother you.

562
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,480
What are you looking at?

563
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,480
Are you eating or not?

564
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,160
Just give me a bowl of rice.

565
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,120
Alright.

566
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,280
He's so troublesome.

567
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,160
It's good that he's not back.

568
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
I'm so comfortable alone in my home.

569
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,960
Ungrateful guy!

570
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
Since he's not back,
I'll sleep in my room.

571
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
Why should I

572
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
sleep here?

573
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,080
Hello.

574
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,960
Officer Wu,

575
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,560
this is Zheng Bei.

576
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240
He regards Zhou Xiaoxiao
as his own sister.

577
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,520
They are very close.

578
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
At that time, he was just a student.

579
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
He was naive.

580
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,080
You know how terrible

581
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,680
people who die of drugs look.

582
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,080
He hates drugs

583
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
very much.

584
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
If he were a drug dealer,

585
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,160
I would have caught him on the spot.

586
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,200
This is different.

587
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,320
It's a kid.

588
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Not even an adult.

589
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,360
He took drugs
because the drug dealers lured him.

590
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,920
They tempted him

591
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,120
to take drugs.

592
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,640
He didn't
take the initiative to do that.

593
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
That's different.

594
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,200
Xiao.

595
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,680
- Bei.
- Bei.

596
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,480
Morning.

597
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,560
Bei.

598
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,760
Don't look around. He didn't come.

599
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Bei.

600
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,160
I heard you and Ran...

601
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,120
Go away.

602
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,920
Okay.

603
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,360
Well...

604
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,840
Did you see him?

605
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
No.

606
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
- No.
- No.

607
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
Bei,

608
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,560
is Ran angry?

609
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,960
I think so.

610
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,800
Bei said something harsh yesterday.

611
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,480
What did I say?

612
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
I explained it to him clearly.

613
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
He kept banging on the table.

614
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
What did I say?

615
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,000
He shouldn't have done that.

616
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,680
How could he bang on the table?

617
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,800
But you

618
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,880
asked him to go back
to Huazhou yesterday...

619
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,600
Yao,

620
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,440
get me some warm water, please.

621
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Your cup is full.

622
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
I want more.

623
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,000
Me too.

624
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,640
Get lost.

625
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,240
Impossible.

626
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,360
You're a leader.

627
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,600
Come on.

628
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Mr. Gu, do you want to know
where you are?

629
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
Then tell me

630
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,240
where I am.

631
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
I'll give you a day

632
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,960
to make ten kilograms of Lucifer for me.

633
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,920
I've got some raw materials for you.

634
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,200
See what else you need later.

635
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
I can ask my men to go buy it for you.

636
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
They are new here.

637
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,280
You haven't answered me

638
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,560
where I am.

639
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
In Halan.

640
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,320
Yes.

641
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
We are in Halan.

642
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,720
And you want to escape from Halan.

643
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,560
We cast a wide net.

644
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,280
You can't escape.

645
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,960
Every way you find

646
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
requires a lot of money.

647
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
Your suppliers and clients
were arrested.

648
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,920
You daren't find

649
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
those who you made deals with.

650
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,480
Once you found them, you were betrayed.

651
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,680
So you caught me

652
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,600
and asked me to make drugs

653
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
and earn money for you.

654
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,520
I like smart people.

655
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
What do you want in return?

656
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Do you think it's possible?

657
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

658
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm a policeman.

659
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,280
But you have to live

660
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
to be a cop.

661
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,680
Dog.

662
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,200
Come in here.

663
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,440
Mouse.

664
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,840
Ran,

665
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,880
help me.

666
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,480
It seems like

667
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,240
I've been working hard for money.

668
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,560
When I was young,

669
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
my family was poor.

670
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,720
I had no choice.

671
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,080
I could only hammer nails for others

672
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,360
to make money.

673
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,440
I earned money too slowly.

674
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,000
My dad died before I could give him
a good life.

675
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,240
Then I hit people over the head
with this hammer.

676
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,360
I made money quickly by doing this.

677
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Very quickly.

678
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Your captain is Zheng Bei, right?

679
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,280
He's something.

680
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,360
Now the police are looking for me.

681
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,280
Even this crazy drug addict

682
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
tried to help him catch me.

683
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,960
Qin Yi.

684
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,520
Qin Yi!

685
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,200
Later,

686
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,520
I found a faster way to make money.

687
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,400
Drugs.

688
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,920
Mr. Gu,

689
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,640
I just told you

690
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,920
if you made drugs for me,

691
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,280
I can give you whatever you want.

692
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,440
I think it's possible.

693
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
What about you?

694
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
One kilogram.

695
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,520
Ten kilograms of Lucifer need
too many materials.

696
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,240
You don't have enough men.

697
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,360
If they buy a lot of materials
at a time,

698
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,480
they will be noticed.

699
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,960
Go on.

700
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,720
I can't guarantee

701
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
it's exactly like Lucifer.

702
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,360
But at least it is pure enough.

703
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,840
I also need a clean room

704
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,000
with running water as the lab.

705
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,480
I need a lot of raw materials.

706
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
The amount of each material
is different.

707
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
OK.

708
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,400
Dog,

709
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,200
get a piece of paper.

710
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,600
Bei,

711
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
I didn't find him.

712
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,840
Did Ran really go back to Huazhou?

713
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,040
Impossible.

714
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,560
You guys

715
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,960
put down the things and come out.

716
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
Dog,

717
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,160
stay here.

718
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,560
Do what Mr. Gu asks.

719
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
Call me when it's done.

720
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,560
Let's go.

721
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,960
There will be a strong smell later.

722
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,080
It's poisonous.

723
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,240
How did it go?

724
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,160
We found nothing.

725
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,080
We searched all the places
we could find.

726
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,120
We asked inns and police stations.

727
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,120
No news about him.

728
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,800
We can't run around
like headless chickens.

729
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,400
Halan is not small.

730
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
We don't have any clues.
How can we find him?

731
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Hello, Xiong.

732
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,520
Bei,

733
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,200
I've asked several people.

734
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,240
They don't know.

735
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,560
What about that guy?

736
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,320
I mean Mouse.

737
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,360
We've been out of touch for days.

738
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,120
How about this?

739
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,640
I'll ask more people.

740
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,320
Done.

741
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,360
Hello?

742
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
Bei,

743
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,360
I was captured by Qin Yi.

744
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,680
Be quiet and listen to me.

745
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm in an abandoned factory right now.

746
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,800
There is a tall tower next to it.

747
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
About 30 meters tall.

748
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,400
There is a wild forest here

749
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,920
and a chimney

750
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,320
about 100 meters tall.

751
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,200
Stop!

752
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,840
Sodium dichloroisocyanurate.

753
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,760
What's wrong, Bei?

754
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
Is Ran in danger?

755
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,560
Quickly find it out.

756
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,160
What is this?

757
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,960
Hurry!

758
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,720
Tell Director Gao,

759
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,680
Gu Yiran was caught by Qin Yi.

760
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,760
What?

761
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,640
Got it!

762
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,480
Xiaoguang, get a map.

763
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,440
Okay.

764
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,480
Circle

765
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,600
all the abandoned factories

766
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,320
next to wild forests.

767
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,400
There are so many such places.

768
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,000
How can we find it?

769
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,440
I'm in an abandoned factory right now.

770
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,600
There is a tall tower next to it.

771
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,520
About 30 meters tall.

772
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,120
There is a wild forest here.

773
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,440
Find the ones along the railway.

774
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Circle all the abandoned factories

775
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
near the railway

776
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
and the wild forest.

777
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,200
[Liuhe Cement Factory]

778
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,960
[Lianhe Chemical Plant]

779
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
I found three, Bei.

780
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,760
Let's go.

781
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,800
Gu Yiran. Mr. Gu.

782
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,800
Should I praise you

783
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,400
or call you stupid?

784
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,480
I can't believe you made a bomb
to get away.

785
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,720
But you ran less than 200 meters

786
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,720
and got caught.

787
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,960
What's the point of it?

788
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
I think

789
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,880
it has a point.

790
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
Dog.

791
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,240
Mr. Gu is a scholar.

792
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,400
Be polite.

793
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,920
Nineteen seconds on the phone.

794
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,600
You called Zheng Bei, right?

795
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
This crappy place

796
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,440
doesn't even have a road sign.

797
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,000
How can he save you?

798
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,320
You're dreaming.

799
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
We could have cooperated well,

800
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,760
and nothing would happen.

801
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,960
I even prepared a hot pot for night

802
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,640
to thank you.

803
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,400
Why do you have to force me?

804
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,120
Gu Yiran,

805
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
I'll give you one last chance.

806
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,160
Keep the chance

807
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,680
for yourself.

808
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,480
For myself?

809
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,440
Bei, what is this sodium...?

810
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,920
Sodium dichloroisocyanurate

811
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,840
is an effective disinfectant.

812
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,840
It's usually used

813
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,160
in the circulating water systems
of factories,

814
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,720
chemical plants, and petroleum plants.

815
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,680
It's pungent.

816
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm a policeman.

817
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,320
I won't make drugs for you.

818
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,760
Cop, huh?

819
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,520
But Ran is being held
in an abandoned factory.

820
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,360
There shouldn't be any
of this stuff there.

821
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,920
Other than factories...

822
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,080
Hospitals also use it abundantly, right?

823
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
But there can't be a hospital
in wilderness.

824
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,800
It is a crematorium.

825
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,640
In half an hour,

826
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,400
write down the formula and process.

827
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,880
Kill him if he doesn't talk

828
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,240
within half an hour.

829
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,720
Got it, boss.

830
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,520
A crematorium.

831
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,960
The places that fit all conditions

832
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,440
are in this direction.

833
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,160
The small steel mill next
to Linshan Crematorium.

834
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,120
Well, then let's not split up.

835
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,440
Just focus on it.

836
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,160
We have to search all three places.

837
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,160
There can be no accidents.

838
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,960
Understood.

839
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,120
Why do you want to die?

840
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,760
You are not our only choice.

841
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
We had a cook before.

842
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,000
He's also a college student.

843
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,520
He said he could make
this high-grade drug.

844
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,720
But he failed

845
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,080
and wasted a lot of raw materials.

846
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,000
Do you know what happened to him?

847
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
We put him in a meat grinder

848
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,920
and made him into ham sausages.

849
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,560
We threw the sausages on the street.

850
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,000
Wild dogs love them.

851
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,440
If you want to die no matter what,

852
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
since your skin is fair,

853
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
I can make you into lunch meat.

854
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,480
Stop talking nonsense.

855
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
He seems dying.

856
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
His life is quite valuable.

857
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,000
Go ask our boss

858
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,520
whether to kill him.

859
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,600
Don't move!

860
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,000
- Bei!
- Bei!

861
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,840
Quick!

862
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,080
Take him to the hospital!

863
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay.

864
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,560
- Come on.
- Carry him away.

865
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,920
- Carry him away.
- Come on.

866
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,800
Slow down.

867
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,440
Slow down.

868
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,160
Be careful.

869
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,760
Slow down.

870
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,240
How did it go?

871
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,960
We found Mouse.

872
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,880
He died.

873
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,680
Where is Qin Yi?

874
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,560
We didn't see him.

875
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,720
But there's only one exit here.

876
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,720
We are guarding it.

877
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,920
He must still be here.

878
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,240
Let's go.

879
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,800
Got it.

880
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Bei, we searched all the corners.

881
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,160
We only found a bunch of materials
and tools to make drugs.

882
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,960
No one here.

883
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,640
Did you find anyone?

884
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,520
