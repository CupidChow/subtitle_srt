But later, he explained,

193
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,040
it's not superstition.

194
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,320
No matter how fast and far

195
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,760
you go,

196
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,960
you always end up coming home.

197
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,040
Li Wenlong escaped over the wall!

198
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,600
Hurry!

199
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,460
Over here!

200
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,400
Where is he?

201
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Where is he?

202
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,960
He got away.

203
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,120
What are you doing holding a gun?

204
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Can't shoot?

205
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,800
You let him run away!

206
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
It's my fault.

207
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
He mentioned my dad.

208
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,680
Don't make me regret
bringing you onto this task force.

209
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Snap out of it!

210
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,880
Mr. Lin.

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,200
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

212
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,560
Dad,

213
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,440
I've got some guys

214
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,400
who know good cooks.

215
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,960
We could do this ourselves.

216
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
Every time we barely get a slice.

217
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,600
How's that enough?

218
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Of course, I know.

219
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,320
You think I don't?

220
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,720
But the thing is,
we don't control this territory yet.

221
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,360
We need to be patient.

222
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
Can't we just

223
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,920
switch territories?

224
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Freeze!

225
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,720
You shoot.

226
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
I shoot.

227
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,880
You shoot.

228
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,560
Stop messing around.

229
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,000
Or you'll ruin it.

230
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,800
Dad,

231
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,320
isn't it crazy how the Russians

232
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,800
invented this game?

233
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,960
Russian roulette...

234
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,040
I don't have enough lives to play this.

235
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,880
Alright, enough.

236
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,840
Bring me those two cases.

237
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,600
[Chairman Office]

238
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,400
Come in.

239
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,680
Police. Don't move!

240
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,160
- Freeze! We're police!
- Freeze!

241
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

242
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,880
Give me the gun!

243
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,480
Freeze!

244
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Freeze!

245
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,280
Drop the gun! Don't move!

246
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,880
Don't move! Cuff him!

247
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,600
Easy.

248
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,040
Captain Wang,

249
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,520
are you alright?

250
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Xiaoguang, what's the situation?

251
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Bei,

252
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,680
we've secured the factory.

253
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,880
Most of the goods are here.

254
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
Have you caught anyone?

255
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,760
No sign of Liang Jiaju,

256
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
but we've got the place surrounded.

257
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,200
He won't get away.

258
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
Have you seen Jiang Xiaohai?

259
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,120
No.

260
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,680
Okay. Be careful.

261
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,840
Are you injured?

262
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
Just minor stuff here.

263
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,160
You?

264
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
Nothing serious, just some scrapes.

265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Get Wang

266
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,960
to update HQ right away.

267
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,520
Captain Wang, report to HQ
with the status update.

268
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
Okay.

269
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,280
Found them.

270
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,080
Their hideout is tough to break into.

271
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,160
Xueyao's team is holding the perimeter.

272
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
But they won't be able to
slip out easily.

273
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Everyone,

274
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,920
check your gear!

275
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,040
Let's go!

276
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,080
Move!

277
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Ammo!

278
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
Are you alright?

279
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,880
Yeah.

280
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
They're holed up deep inside.

281
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Too many barriers. Can't get through.

282
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Look around

283
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
and see if there's another entry point.

284
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
We've already checked.

285
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,400
It's a dead end.

286
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Wu!

287
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,600
There's still one inside.

288
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,680
Everyone, stay sharp!

289
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,040
Okay.

290
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Go.

291
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
Liang Jiaju's definitely inside.

292
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,760
It's a thick door.

293
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
We can't pry it open.

294
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,480
Xiaoguang, do you have any explosives?

295
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,520
Blow it open.

296
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
Hello.

297
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Director Gao.

298
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,280
What's the update?

299
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Director Zhao.

300
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,760
The suspect, Jiang Yingzi,

301
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,800
has been captured.

302
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,960
But during the arrest,

303
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
she got shot twice in the right leg

304
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,520
and is currently in a coma.

305
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,560
She's being rushed to
the People's Hospital now.

306
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,760
Send extra men to guard the ward.

307
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,960
Yes.

308
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Li Wenlong managed to escape,

309
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,680
but no one outside

310
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
saw him leave.

311
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,200
We're expanding the search area

312
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,240
to find him.

313
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,920
The suspects, Bai Ling,

314
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,760
Lin Zhida, and Lin Jiang,

315
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
have been captured.

316
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,640
We're escorting them over.

317
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,880
- Dispatch the team...
- Director Gao.

318
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
Liang Jiaju is hiding
in a secret room in the factory.

319
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,000
The door's jammed.

320
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They need explosives to break it down.

321
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,600
They've requested a batch to be sent.

322
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,120
Guozhu,

323
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,680
- take a team and send those explosives.
- Okay.

324
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,360
Hold on.

325
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,040
Director Gao, I'll go.

326
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,080
These rookies barely know
how to handle explosives.

327
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,280
Better if I go.

328
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Be careful.

329
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,880
You're not young anymore.

330
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
You're retiring at the end of the month.

331
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,880
Director Gao,

332
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,000
I haven't said this to you in 20 years.

333
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,840
Captain Gao, do you trust me?

334
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,160
I do!

335
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,840
Get out of here.

336
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
Yes!

337
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
I'm going.

338
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Be careful, Uncle.

339
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,180
[Drug Processing Factory]

340
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,800
I've finally figured out

341
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,040
why we couldn't find out

342
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,520
how they got the drugs in.

343
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
There's another tunnel.

344
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,840
Gu Yiran,

345
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,680
if you're going to
keep spacing out like this,

346
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,600
sit this one out.

347
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Don't come along.

348
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,280
It's a coal truck.

349
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,840
It's probably used for moving the drugs.

350
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,440
This tunnel leads directly
to the drug manufacturing factory.

351
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Look.

352
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
There's crystal residue.

353
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
We can take the tunnel

354
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,240
and get there faster
than driving around.

355
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,260
[Drug Manufacturing Factory]

356
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,280
Uncle?

357
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,360
What are you doing here?

358
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,040
Brought you guys some fireworks.

359
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,120
Seriously,

360
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
you didn't need to bring this yourself.

361
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,800
We could've handled it.

362
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,760
You?

363
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
The guy who burned his hand
with sparklers?

364
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,280
No chance.

365
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
This place is dangerous!

366
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,400
You should stay in the station.

367
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,760
You're almost retired.

368
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,000
Why did you come here?

369
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,440
You're talking too much.

370
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,120
There's nothing dangerous.

371
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,440
You've caught all the bad guys.

372
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,280
Tell me where to bomb.

373
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,800
Here.

374
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,480
Hurry up.

375
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,120
Be careful, Uncle.

376
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,560
Don't talk.

377
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,920
Stay back.

378
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,160
Keep your distance.

379
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
These two factories had nothing to do
with each other before,

380
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,360
but they dug out
a whole tunnel between them.

381
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,920
What was that?

382
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,240
What just blew up?

383
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Xiaoguang,

384
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
what was that explosion?

385
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,960
Bei, we're blowing the door.

386
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,040
Liang Jiaju's behind the door.

387
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,040
What? I can't hear you!

388
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,080
We're blasting the door open.

389
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,400
Uncle's here with us.

390
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,440
What?

391
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,520
Just blowing the door.

392
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,400
It's all good, Bei.

393
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,040
We've got it under control.

394
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,160
Let's go now.

395
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Let's go!

396
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,480
Let's go!

397
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,320
Uncle,

398
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,560
you missed this one.

399
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
Piss off.

400
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,760
My skills are getting rusty.

401
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
I didn't use enough.

402
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Stop staring.

403
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,240
Go get the boxes.

404
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes.

405
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,040
There's a door.

406
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Why is the door rattling?

407
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,400
Xiaoguang.

408
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,920
Don't blow this door.
It's packed with explosives here!

409
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,800
Quick, disarm the bomb!

410
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,120
Don't open the door!

411
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Everyone, stay put!

412
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,280
Back up!

413
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,000
It's opening.

414
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,820
Don't push the door, Bei!
