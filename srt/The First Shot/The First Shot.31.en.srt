How did you meet him?

I met not only him

He still took care of me back then.

173

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,520

because of you.

192
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,080
As for Jiang Xiaohai,

193
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,600
I can't decide whether
to call him sentimental

194
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
or thoughtful.

195
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,400
After I went south to study,

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
I lost contact with him

197
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,520

the college entrance exams.

[Until the year of

199
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm done.

200
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
I've got one more paper to finish.

201
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,720
Take it easy.

202
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,640
These days have been
overwhelming for me.

203
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm so stressed.

204
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160
See you around, Jiaju.

205
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,480
See you around.

206
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,200
Bye.

207
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
He found out through Qin Yi

208
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,400
that I was studying in Zhanzhou.

209
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,920
He then went there.

210
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,480
I didn't know how long
he'd been following me,

211
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,360
how long he'd been in Zhanzhou,

212
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,680
or how long he'd been looking for me.

213
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840

I hung out with my classmates.

236

because school had us

so stressed out.

266
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,080
that you provided the formula.

267
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,880

340
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
I believe Jiang Xiaohai is behind this.

341
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,840
He's got a lot of detonators.

342
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,600
Only he can make such explosions.

343
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,000
It shouldn't be.

344
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Jiang Xiaohai should be
busy with fleeing now.

345
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
Why would he have time
to make explosions?

346
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
He's doing this to run away.

347
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,440
How's he going to get away

348
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,240
without distracting us?

349
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,760
We've arrested
the entire drug trafficking gang.

350
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
Only Jiang Xiaohai
and Li Wenlong are left.

With only a few guys following them,

352
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,360
if he doesn't make some noise now,

353
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,320
can he escape?

354
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,080
What will he do?

355
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm not sure.

356
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,440
Director Gao,

357
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,160
I'd like to request additional personnel

358
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
to search the city.

359
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,920
What about the bomb?

360
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Just leave it?

361
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
These three places are far apart.

362
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,160
We'll check them all,

363
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,720
but we're short on manpower.

364
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
I don't have any personnel to spare.

365
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,640
It must be Jiang Xiaohai.

366
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Are you sure?

367
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,360
Zheng Bei, we can't go by hunches.

368
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,600
If you're wrong,

369
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,160
and Jiang Xiaohai didn't do this

370
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
while there's not
enough police presence,

371
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,840
the third bomb could go off.

372
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,200
How many casualties would that cause?

373
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,480
The safety of people's lives
and property

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,240
