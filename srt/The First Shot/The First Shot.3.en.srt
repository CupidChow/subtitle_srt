Forget it.

192
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,940
I grew up afraid of teachers.

193
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,100
I wouldn't dare call you by your name.

194
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,500
I'll call you Mr. Gu.

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,980
Yeah. We've got cases to solve.

196
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,300
We don't have time for your lessons.

197
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,940
You're solving drug cases.

198
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,900
You have to know about drugs

199
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,980
and chemistry first.

200
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,020
Mr. Gu's lessons are good.

201
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,860
You should learn more.

202
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,620
It'll help.

203
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,180
However, these books are thick.

204
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,620
We don't have time to read

205
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,180
in this job.

206
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,140
That's right.

207
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,780
Our mission today, for instance,

208
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,900
was accomplished with this.

209
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,020
Yeah.

210
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,100
It's just

211
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,380
a coincidence today.

212
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,900
Even if we were late,

213
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Bei could have made it on his own.

214
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Ignorance is an obstruction to success.

215
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,300
What's worse is

216
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,060
not realizing you're ignorant.

217
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,660
What do you mean?

218
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,300
Are you showing off

219
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,100
because only you are well-educated?

220
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,820
Xiaoguang,

221
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,700
what are you doing?

222
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,980
Sit down.

223
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,140
Mr. Gu's just teaching you.

224
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
What's with your attitude?

225
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,860
Mr. Gu,

226
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
sorry.

227
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,660
We're all young men here

228
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,940
in the police force.

229
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,020
We're hot-tempered.

230
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,700
So please watch your language.

231
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,380
Advice is seldom welcome.

232
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,700
Mr. Gu,

233
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,100
I suppose

234
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,900
you're just a consultant,

235
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
but why do you
see yourself as one of us?

236
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,980
You're

237
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
wrong about that.

238
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,460
Mr. Gao invited me here

239
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,100
to officially join
the special investigation team.

240
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,500
I'll be working with all of you

241
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,580
and going on missions.

242
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,780
The transfer paperwork
will be done in a few days.

243
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,660
I'll work here until the case is solved

244
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,380
and every drug dealer is caught.

245
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,300
Great.

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,020
With Mr. Gu's help,

247
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,460
we'll catch every drug dealer,

248
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,340
right?

249
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,300
Yes.

250
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,780
Dear God.

251
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,980
Uncle.

252
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,180
Get ready for this.

253
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,260
Uncle.

254
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,020
Help him out.

255
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,860
Food's ready.

256
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,980
Don't do it. It's hot.

257
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,540
It's hot.

258
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,060
Don't reach for it.

259
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,900
Okay. Be right back.

260
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,340
It looks nice.

261
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,700
Uncle, let me give you a hand.

262
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Hurry up.

263
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
What's this?

264
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Stir-fried rice noodles?

265
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,740
You don't know this?

266
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,700
It's a famous Northeastern dish.
Stewed pork with vermicelli.

267
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,100
You've never seen this?

268
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,740
It's a Northeastern specialty.

269
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,940
Do you have it in your place?

270
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,460
We have stewed soup.

271
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,380
Stewed soup?

272
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,100
Alright now.

273
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,900
Take a seat.

274
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,020
This is a dish?

275
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,380
Yes.

276
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,300
Not staple food?

277
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,660
Who would have this as staple food?

278
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,780
Rice is our staple food here.

279
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,020
This rice smells good.

280
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,220
Here, Bei.

281
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,020
Weren't we just going to grab a bite?

282
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,540
It's just one dish here.

283
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,900
What's wrong, cultured guy?

284
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,940
Are you stunned?

285
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
That's how much we usually eat.

286
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,020
There are more dishes?

287
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,100
Let me help you with that.

288
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,620
Alright.

289
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,140
Thanks.

290
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,700
It's for you.

291
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,900
Mr. Gu, can you handle spicy food?

292
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
I like it a little bit,

293
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,380
but I feel sick every time I eat it.

294
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,300
It means you can't.

295
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Okay. Got it.

296
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,500
We now have two people

297
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,980
on the special investigation team
who can't eat peppers.

298
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,180
Who's the other one?

299
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,940
This guy.

300
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,820
Me.

301
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,180
He looks tough.

302
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,900
He gets diarrhea
right after having spicy food.

303
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,540
You can't handle spicy food but garlic?

304
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,660
Peppers and garlic

305
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,420
aren't the same thing.

306
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,580
A meal without garlic

307
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
isn't perfect.

308
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,060
- Yeah.
- Right, Uncle?

309
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,860
Cut the small talk. Just eat.

310
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,300
How do you like it?

311
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,780
Cut the small talk. Just eat.

312
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,660
Are you done eating?

313
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,300
Just go ahead.

314
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,540
You're quite the eater.

315
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,340
Here.

316
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,260
Just get all of this.

317
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,820
Alright.

318
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,740
That's a lot.

319
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,100
There are some shredded turnips here.

320
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,180
That's the third bowl you've had.

321
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,100
Can you still eat?

322
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,060
You thought you'd amaze him,

323
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,540
but you're stunned now.

324
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,100
Do office workers eat that much now?

325
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm an office worker.

326
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,260
One bowl is enough for me.

327
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,340
I like him.

328
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,300
Look at him.

329
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
You guys aren't good enough.

330
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,420
You eat

331
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,460
like a kitten.

332
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,300
My granddaughter eats more than you.

333
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,140
That's nonsense, Uncle.

334
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,820
Your granddaughter's in first grade.

335
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,500
You're lying...

336
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,540
So what if she's in first grade?

337
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,180
She'll go to college soon.

338
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,460
Guess what?

339
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,980
Once

340
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,100
the case is closed,

341
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,820
I'll retire

342
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,340
and take my granddaughter
to Hainan for a vacation.

343
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,500
Uncle, don't say that.

344
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,100
You'll get into trouble if you do,
you know?

345
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Piss off.

346
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,860
That's superstition.

347
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,900
You're asking for a beating.

348
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,420
Alright now. The food's all finished.

349
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,380
Get back to your work now.

350
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,700
Uncle, we'll clean it up for you.

351
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
No. Just get back to your work.

352
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Captain Zheng, what will we do next?

353
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,980
Come here. I'd like to announce

354
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,940
we've completed the handover

355
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,140
with the major crimes unit.

356
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,740
The white building meth case

357
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
has been handed over to us.

358
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,220
- Guozhu.
- Yes.

359
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,940
You and Yao go around

360
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,900
the glass factory

361
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,340
to see if there are any witnesses.

362
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,260
Yes.

363
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,380
Take the file.

364
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,660
We'll go to the train station.

365
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
Okay.

366
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,540
What about me?

367
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,260
You're new here,

368
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,900
and you eat a lot.

369
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,700
You'll work on your digestion here.

370
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,220
[Halan]

371
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,020
Gentlemen, this way.

372
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,340
When you came here previously,

373
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,620
I was on break.

374
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,780
I didn't help much.

375
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,540
Just tell me when you need me.

376
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,700
The tickets show these seats.

377
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,780
These are the seats, right?

378
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,420
Yes.

379
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,900
On the 31st,

380
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,340
who sat here?

381
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,380
Do you remember?

382
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,860
The 31st?

383
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,460
That was a while ago.

384
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
I'll have to think about it.

385
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,540
I think they were all men.

386
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,300
Are you sure?

387
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes.

388
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,700
That side was full of old ladies

389
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,300
with kids.

390
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,940
They were screaming all the way.

391
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,980
I remember it very well.

392
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,540
I finally managed to quiet them down

393
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,420
until late at night,

394
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,540
but then they started snoring.

395
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,540
Good grief.

396
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,900
Those snores were loud.

397
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,500
I couldn't sleep well
for the whole night.

398
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,260
What did those guys look like?

399
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,100
Do you still remember?

400
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,540
None of them were aged.

401
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,740
They were
in their twenties and thirties.

402
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,300
Did they arrive together

403
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,780
or respectively?

404
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,020
I suppose they came respectively,

405
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,500
but I'm not sure.

406
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Did the occupant of this seat

407
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,300
bring anything suspicious?

408
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,380
He wouldn't get that.

409
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,140
We check all the passengers
who board the train.

410
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,060
We didn't find anything,

411
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,300
so there wasn't anything suspicious.

412
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,180
Okay. Everything's fine.

413
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,380
We're just asking.

414
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,220
Thank you.

415
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,300
No worries.

416
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,100
That's a nice watch.

417
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,340
It's just for pleasure.

418
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,140
See you around.

419
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Call me when you need me.

420
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,220
Thank you.

421
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,100
No worries.

422
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,980
Xiaoguang,

423
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,460
keep an eye on him.

424
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,260
Okay.

425
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
It's getting late.

426
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,100
We don't have much to do tonight.

427
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,740
Should we go back to the station or home?

428
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,700
To the station.

429
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,820
Mr. Gu's ready to work overtime

430
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,900
and teach us.

431
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,260
We're already under
so much pressure with the cases.

432
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,180
Why is this guy such a pain in the ass?

433
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,780
Mr. Gao has his reasons

434
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,940
for inviting him here.

435
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,060
Since when do you listen to Mr. Gao?

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,940
Red light!

437
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,980
Bei, why don't we find a way

438
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,100
to get rid of Gu?

439
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,620
Put your mind

440
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,300
to good use.

441
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,260
What are you thinking?

442
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,460
Hey,

443
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,940
we're members of
the special investigation team,

444
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,580
but he's an outsider

445
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,980
who keeps bossing us around.

446
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,660
Drive.

447
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,500
Well, you need

448
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,580
to think of it this way, Xiaoguang.

449
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,340
What do you think of
your driving skills?

450
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,940
You know it well.

451
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
While we're in Halan,

452
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,780
I always get you

453
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,300
to your destination right away.

454
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,860
What if we aren't in Halan?

455
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,900
While we aren't in Halan?

456
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,340
Then I won't know where to drive.

457
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,380
Exactly.

458
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,740
That's what I mean.

459
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,660
Over the years,

460
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,140
new types of drugs
are growing in popularity.

461
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,740
We don't have a specialized

462
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,060
anti-drug unit in the police force.

463
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,140
There's no such program in the academy.

464
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,140
If we really need to deal with

465
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,500
a large-scale
drug trafficking organization,

466
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,740
we won't be able to get it done.

467
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,500
It's like driving.

468
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,860
No matter how good you are,

469
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,380
if you don't know the roads,

470
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,740
you won't know where to drive.

471
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,780
So you're saying

472
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,460
we'll use Gu Yiran as a map.

473
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,980
When you drive,

474
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,620
you'll use him as a map.

475
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,900
When you need to read,

476
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,660
you'll use him as a dictionary.

477
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,380
So what Mr. Gu has

478
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,140
is what we need now.

479
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,900
He's like

480
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,340
an encyclopedia of new drugs.

481
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,580
Why wouldn't we use him?

482
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,940
I get your point now.

483
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,900
I just don't appreciate what he's doing.

484
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,060
He's always arrogant.

485
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,660
Take it easy.

486
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,660
In Halan,

487
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,020
life is tough.

488
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,340
He won't stay long.

489
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,700
Got it.

490
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,950
[Halan Public Security Bureau]
Catalytic hydrogenation method

491
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,260
[Halan Public Security Bureau]
is divided into three main steps.

492
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,940
The first step is called chlorination.

493
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,940
Ephedrine and thionyl chloride

494
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,540
are reacted to produce Chloroephedrine.

495
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,100
The second step is hydrodechlorination.

496
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,100
That's enough.

497
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,300
Look at the time now.

498
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
We've had a long day.

499
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
It's time for us to go home.

500
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,380
- Go home?
- Go home?

501
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,140
Are you all sleepy?

502
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,420
Right?

503
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,580
Look, that's what we all need.

504
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,660
Just finish it.

505
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Today's lesson is a bit obscure.

506
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,980
Let's call it a day.

507
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,100
Let's go home!

508
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Mr. Gu, see you.

509
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,260
Mr. Gu,

510
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,300
take your suitcase

511
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,660
and put it in my car.

512
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,380
I'll bring it in one load.

513
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,100
Where to?

514
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,180
To my place.

515
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
My home is on the second floor.

516
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,380
We'll go upstairs from here.

517
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,300
Still up?

518
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
I'll sleep in a while.

519
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,700
Come here.

520
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,980
It's not easy to open the door.

521
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,420
Come in.

522
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,980
How do you like my place?

523
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,260
The walls are painted black.

524
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,380
Isn't it depressing?

525
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,420
They used to be white.

526
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,060
I was lost when I was a kid.

527
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,780
My eyes were hurt
by the glare of the snow

528
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,780
and I couldn't see.

529
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,100
My parents were terrified

530
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,220
and painted the walls black.

531
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,260
Snow blindness?

532
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,580
Sort of.

533
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
I was blind for several days,

534
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,260
but then I recovered.

535
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,820
Come in here.

536
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,700
How is it?

537
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,380
There's only one bed.

538
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,620
There are two beds.

539
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,620
I've got a folding one here.

540
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,660
You'll sleep up there.

541
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,700
I'll take this one.

542
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,820
I can take the folding bed.

543
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,100
I can't let you do that.

544
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,220
I'm fine with this.

545
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,340
I'm used to sleeping in it.

546
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,460
I used to do it on business trips.

547
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,500
Okay, thanks.

548
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Xiaoguang, time to eat.

549
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,380
Coming, Bei.

550
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,700
Have you got the stuff unpacked?

551
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,100
We'll do it later.

552
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,420
Well, where's Nan?

553
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,820
I forgot.

554
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,020
Nan, time to eat.

555
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,380
Nan!

556
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,220
It's your house, too?

557
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,660
My parents and my sister live here.

558
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,020
This whole row is my house.

559
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,340
It's nice, huh?

560
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,460
Is she still on duty?

561
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,820
Probably.

562
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,660
Forget it then.

563
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,780
Let's go for dinner.

564
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,020
Let's wait while eating.

565
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:52,240
[Mr. Zheng Great Chicken Ribs]

566
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,180
Here.

567
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,220
I'm almost done here,

568
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,060
so I won't make stewed chicken for you.

569
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,660
We'll make do with some chicken ribs.

570
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,580
This isn't making do.

571
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,900
Mr. Zheng's chicken ribs

572
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
are the best in Halan.

573
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,140
Just eat some.

574
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,220
I love that.

575
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,740
Have some more.

576
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,540
Gu, make yourself home.

577
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,700
Just try these

578
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,220
Northeastern chicken ribs.

579
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,620
They're delicious.

580
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,460
Thanks, ma'am.

581
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,060
Use your hands, not the chopsticks.

582
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,020
Grab them with your hands.

583
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,260
No one uses chopsticks for these.

584
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,220
It tastes better while grabbing it.

585
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,940
- Do you like it?
- Do you like it?

586
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,500
It's amazing.

587
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,660
Have some more.

588
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,460
Why are you so late today?

589
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
I was going to make you a goose stew.

590
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,820
But it's getting late.

591
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,820
Mr. Gu was giving us a lesson.

592
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,660
Otherwise, we'd be back earlier.

593
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
Sorry.

594
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,260
I'll watch my lecture time from now on.

595
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,020
Alright now.

596
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,660
Work on that from now on.

597
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,740
Hey,

598
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,300
will you teach again?

599
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Just eat.

600
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
You keep talking crap.

601
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,660
You're giving them lessons?

602
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,860
It's too much work for you.

603
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,540
These boys didn't like to study
when they were kids.

604
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,620
Hey, Mrs. Zheng,

605
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,220
how can you favor an outsider?

606
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,980
He isn't an outsider.

607
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,020
You're all in the same unit.

608
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,940
You all serve the people.

609
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,300
See? My mom's got more sense than you.

610
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,940
What kind of policeman are you?

611
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,540
Yeah.

612
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,700
If you ask me,

613
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,820
it's good for the youngsters
to take more classes.

614
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,900
My generation

615
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,580
suffered from a lack of culture.

616
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,420
Yeah.

617
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,260
Mr. Zheng, you've opened a branch
of your chicken ribs.

618
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,500
In a few years,
it'll be a citywide chain.

619
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,420
Why are you so humble?

620
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,140
Cheers.

621
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,020
Yeah.

622
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,660
Okay.

623
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,940
You're quite slick.

624
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,780
Mr. Zheng, your chicken ribs
are that popular?

625
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,460
Listen,

626
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,780
our stewed meat and chicken ribs

627
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,380
are famous in Jiangtie District.

628
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,020
And even people in the whole Hanlan

629
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,540
love them.

630
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,740
Yeah. You dominate Halan.

631
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,700
You're just bragging.

632
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,260
I'm not bragging.

633
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,820
Listen,

634
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,540
Mr. Gu, let me tell you something.

635
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,740
Do you see Zheng Bei's

636
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,180
shabby car?

637
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,140
In the beginning, my wife and I
drove that car

638
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,260
around the city to sell
our chicken ribs.

639
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,860
Later, they became popular.

640
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,740
We opened this store,

641
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,580
and things got better, right?

642
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,220
Things got better,

643
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,340
and they got better stuff.

644
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
They couldn't sell that shabby car.

645
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
It smells like chicken.

646
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,620
Nobody bought it, so I got it.

647
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,340
Alright.

648
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,260
I was one of the first to
quit my job and go into business.

649
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,820
I was a visionary.

650
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,700
You quit your job
and went into business?

651
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,300
Yes.

652
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,580
You were laid off.

653
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,260
No, Dad, you're right.

654
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,300
We've made a fortune.
That's what matters.

655
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,460
Mr. Zheng.

656
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,020
Dad!

657
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,380
I told you to smoke outside.

658
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,780
My bad.

659
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
- I shouldn't have done this here.
- That startled me.

660
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
What took you so long?

661
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,260
None of your concerns.

662
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,540
I'll smoke outside.

663
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,140
Hurry up.

664
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Why can't your dad

665
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,980
smoke in the house?

666
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,940
My house caught fire
the year before last.

667
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,620
My mom made a rule then

668
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,780
that no one is allowed to smoke here.

669
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,900
No one.

670
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,340
Even Mr. Gao has to smoke outside.

671
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,580
Have some food.

672
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,580
I'm starving.

673
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,540
Just eat up.

674
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,900
Who's this handsome guy?

675
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,100
Hello, I'm Gu Yiran.

676
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,860
Hello.

677
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
Look how infatuated you are.

678
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,700
Can I kick you out?

679
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
He's our new colleague.

680
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,860
She's my sister, Zheng Nan.

681
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,100
My biological sister.

682
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,700
You got a perm?

683
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,820
The hairdresser at the salon did it.

684
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,380
Just tell me if it looks good.

685
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,820
I think

686
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,100
you look better with your old haircut.

687
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,660
Right, Bei?

688
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,260
It looks terrible.

689
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,500
You look old with this.

690
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,460
Turn around and let me see.

691
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,100
Yeah.

692
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,140
What do you know?

693
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,620
This hairstyle is in fashion now.

694
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,660
Looking old is in fashion?

695
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,500
You look too mature now.

696
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,700
Hey,

697
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,500
I'll see you at the salon tomorrow.

698
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,820
You can do my hair.

699
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,740
You keep coming to my salon.

700
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,700
Seriously,

701
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,420
you should grow your hair.

702
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,020
You'll go bold if you get more haircuts.

703
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,140
Yiran,

704
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,180
you don't look like a local.

705
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,500
I'm from Huazhou.

706
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,540
So you're from Yuedong.

707
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,900
You must speak Cantonese, right?

708
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,820
Duh!

709
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,940
Yeah.

710
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Did I ask you?

711
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,420
I've been speaking it since I was a kid.

712
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,820
Cantonese is so beautiful.

713
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,620
Then, do you know how to sing

714
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,540
Zhang Xueyou's songs?

715
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,940
Sorry, I don't.

716
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,700
I do.

717
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,360
♪Your beauty is frozen in time♪

718
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh my God.

719
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,940
- ♪The icy picture holds your warmth♪
- You two are a perfect match.

720
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
You guys go ahead and eat. I'm leaving.

721
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,460
Don't go.

722
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,500
Don't go, Bei.

723
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,340
Mr. Gu,

724
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,340
how is my Cantonese?

725
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,100
Isn't it good?

726
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,940
It's nice.

727
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,780
Try not to speak Cantonese from now on.

728
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,540
Your Cantonese

729
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,820
is poorer than your English.

730
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,660
You're scaring them away.

731
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,300
Bei.

732
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,180
Oh my God.

733
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,380
Where did you get this phone?

734
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Our boss's wife is getting a new one.

735
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,060
She sold this.

736
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,060
Let me tell you,

737
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,340
I spent all my year-end bonus on this.

738
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,460
What for?

739
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,060
It's so expensive.

740
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,140
Why did you spend so much money on it?

741
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,140
How much does this thing cost?

742
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,660
I paid several thousand yuan for it.

743
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,780
She doesn't want her used phone.

744
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,340
Don't run around all day.

745
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,940
I can't find you on the pager.

746
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,260
This stuff works.

747
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,220
Seriously,

748
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,020
you aren't young anymore,

749
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,100
but you always make Mom and Dad worry.

750
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,700
My sister's so nice to me.

751
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,220
Thank you, Nan.

752
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,940
Don't ruin my hairstyle!

753
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,180

Half yuan.
