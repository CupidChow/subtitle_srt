00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,560
we found some words.

193
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,400
But they can't form a sentence.

194
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
So Guozhu suspects it's encrypted.

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes.

196
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
After we checked

197
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
Yifeng Taxi Company,

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
their cabs stopped carrying
anything suspicious.

199
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,360
We've been keeping an eye
on that warehouse,

200
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,040
but then nothing happened.

201
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,560
But the drugs on the market

202
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
didn't reduce at all.

203
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,920
We think

204
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,440
all this information

205
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,040
is encrypted.

206
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,000
They may have got a new way
to communicate.

207
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
That's why we can't find any clues.

208
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
And they're cunning.

209
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,160
They always called
different paging numbers.

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,280
All are one-off.

211
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,320
We can find nothing.

212
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
What should we do?

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,880
Well.

214
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,400
Now, the point is to decode

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,160
the numbers first,

216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,520
or we can't figure anything out.

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes.

218
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,680
This string of numbers

219
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
was found on Erjin's pager.

220
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
Last night,

221
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,360
Yao got it back from the paging center.

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,480
Now, the main thing is

223
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
to make sense of the numbers.

224
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Maybe it's just a string
of permutations.

225
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,120
These guys started to play with codes.

226
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,240
They're really something.

227
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,400
If they

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
really devised

229
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,800
a new code system,

230
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520
we have to decode the numbers

231
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
with the codebook.

232
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,520
It is impossible
to work it out just by thinking.

233
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,000
That is,

234
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,840
they must have a codebook.

235
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,520
Well.

236
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Or they can't communicate.

237
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,560
If they have a codebook,

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
they should have a copy each.

239
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,600
None of these small dealers
we caught recently

240
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,440
mentioned it.

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,480
Then they must have memorized
all the codes.

242
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,480
Impossible.

243
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
- They can't have such a good memory.
- That's ridiculous.

244
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Did you take everything out?

245
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,240
[Story Selection]

246
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,120
Story Selection.

247
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,040
Sun.

248
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,360
Get the evidence bag

249
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,040
of the guy we caught in Blue Aurora.

250
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,920
Okay.

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,960
You remember the guy
who beat you in Blue Aurora?

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Yes, the drug dealer.

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,280
We just found a copy of Story Selection

254
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,360
from those guys.

255
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,920
It is from last month.

256
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Go buy a new one.

257
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Alright.

258
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
No need.

259
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
I have

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,360
the latest issue.

261
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Bei, you mean

262
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
Story Selection is the codebook?

263
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,840
They're quite shrewd.

264
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,840
The stupid ones are all in No. 5 Prison.

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,840
Well, Bei.

266
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Are you praising them?

267
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm telling you.

268
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Whether they are smart or not,

269
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
they will be sent to No. 5 Prison.

270
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,440
That's right.

271
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,360
Bei,

272
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,440
this pager is out of battery.

273
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,560
Put a new battery in.

274
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
I can't charge it.

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Give me a battery. Quick.

276
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
Forget it.

277
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,440
Keep it for yourself.

278
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
OK.

279
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,160
Sure enough, even the format
is the same.

280
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
These are the numbers of pages,

281
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,040
lines, and words?

282
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
We can try it first.

283
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Page two.

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Page two.

285
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,520
Line one, the third word.

286
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Xing.
[*It means "wake" in Chinese.]

287
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,600
[Xing]
Is it line one?

288
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
[Xing]
Maybe it's the first word of line 13.

289
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,240
Let's check them one by one.

290
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,320
Then, the 30th word of line one.

291
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,280
The 30th word.

292
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,640
It's a comma.

293
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,440
- Look at line 13.
- The 30th word is a comma.

294
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
The first word of line 13.

295
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
Line 13. Let me check.

296
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,840
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

297
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
eleven, twelve, thirteen.

298
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
The first word.

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
Shui
[*It means "sleep" in Chinese.]

300
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
The first word is "shui."

301
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,560
That's not right.

302
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Xueyao,

303
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,320
show me

304
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,000
Erjin's pager record.

305
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,360
- Here.
- Page 21 is a chess picture.

306
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,440
Look.

307
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,440
That's right.

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,480
That's why I bought this book.

309
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,040
It has new chess pictures per issue.

310
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,800
I don't think these two numbers

311
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
represent the page.

312
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
Look at the records.

313
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,280
The numbers of the first two digits

314
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,960
are all no greater than twenty-four.

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,640
So, I guess it represents time.

316
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
The following digits represent pages.

317
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,280
I thought about it.

318
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
I met them in Blue Aurora

319
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,600
at around 2 AM that night.

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,320
Analyze the numbers based on this.

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,520
- At 2 AM.
- At 2 AM.

322
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,960
- And then...
- Page thirteen.

323
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,360
The third word of line one.

324
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Page thirteen.

325
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
One, two, three.

326
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,560
"Lan".
[*It means "blue" in Chinese.]

327
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,240
"Lan"?

328
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,040
- "Lan".
- "Lan".

329
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
It makes sense.

330
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,820
[Blue]

331
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Check page 24.

332
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,120
The twelfth word of line eight.

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,840
The twelfth word.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,760
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

335
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,680
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

336
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
eleven, twelve.

337
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Eleven, twelve. It is "Guang".
[*It means "aurora" in Chinese.]

338
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,360
- "Guang".
- "Guang".

339
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,980
[Blue Aurora]

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,880
So what does "080" mean?

341
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,520
Zero, eight, zero.

342
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,080
We have the time and the place.

343
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,400
Then this must represent the goods.

344
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,000
Zero, eight, zero.

345
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
Eighty.

346
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
Eighty?

347
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Eighty.

348
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,880
So the numbers mean

349
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,400
"Trade 80 ecstasy

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
in Blue Aurora

351
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,240
at 2 AM."

352
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Following this idea,

353
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
what can we find

354
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,600
in the latest Story Selection?

355
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,520
Where is it?

356
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Uncle.

357
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, in this way,

358
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
the first word is "Dong".
[*It means "east" in Chinese.]

359
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,480
The second word is "Cai".
[*It means "vegetable" in Chinese.]

360
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Dongcai.

361
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,920
Dong.

362
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,760
D-O-N-G.

363
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,200
C-A-I.

364
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
Dongcai?

365
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,560
Dongtie Market?

366
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,080
Not "Dongnong" or "Dongmao".

367
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,920
What does "Dongcai" mean?

368
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,400
This row sells kitchenware
and small goods.

369
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,280
This row sells vegetables.

370
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
This row sells fish and meat.

371
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,280
We chased

372
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,760
that Yuedong guy there.

373
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
The place that has "Dong" in its name
and sells vegetables in Halan

374
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
can only be Dongtie Market.

375
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,120
My dad calls it "Dongcai".

376
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Your dad?

377
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
My dad's meat stall is here.

378
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,840
I even know how many mouse holes
there are in this market.

379
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,320
Why didn't you say it at that time?

380
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,360
You sent me to watch on the roof.

381
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,800
I didn't go downstairs.

382
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,200
Stay there again this time.

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,820
[Remitter: Zhao Minghao]

384
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,620
Next one.

385
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
Here you are, Madam.

386
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Okay, thanks.

387
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,300
Hello, I want to transfer money.

388
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,500
Show me your ID card.

389
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,780
My ID card is with my uncle.

390
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,300
Can I just tell you my ID card number?

391
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,940
Sorry, I need your ID card.

392
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,100
Go get it.

393
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,980
I have something to do later.

394
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,100
Then I'll come tomorrow.

395
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,700
OK.

396
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,060
Alright.

397
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,860
Next one.

398
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,820
It's almost time.

399
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,940
Guozhu, get yourself together.
Watch carefully.

400
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,500
Everything looks normal.

401
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
Why are there so many blue
and red lanterns

402
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
at restaurant doors

403
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,940
in Halan?

404
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,980
What do they mean?

405
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,980
They are not lanterns.

406
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,740
They are banners.

407
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,100
Banners.

408
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,700
We care about banners
when choosing restaurants.

409
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,860
Small restaurants or snack stores

410
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,460
only have one banner.

411
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,520
Those with two banners

412
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
are better.

413
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,420
If you see four banners,

414
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,340
that must be a great restaurant.

415
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,060
Red banners

416
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,460
represent Han Chinese restaurants.

417
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,020
Blue banners represent
Moslem restaurants.

418
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,480
I saw none of them had three banners.

419
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,960
No restaurant has three banners.

420
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,360
Three banners

421
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,880
sound like "Telling lies".
[*Homophony in Chinese]

422
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,780
Who would want to do that?

423
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,060
Interesting.

424
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,940
We found someone suspicious

425
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
over here.

426
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
Keep an eye on him and get evidence.

427
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
Yao, can you see him?

428
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,040
Yes.

429
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm in a high place. I can film him.

430
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,600
Got it.

431
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,480
Let's go.

432
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,200
Go.

433
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
I've been watching him.

434
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,520
He is pushing a bike alone.

435
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,760
How'd it go?

436
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,760
I told Xiong and his partners

437
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
to keep watching.

438
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
Sun and his partners followed that guy
out the south gate.

439
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,680
We've been spying on them for so long.

440
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,080
Finally, we got some real evidence.

441
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Tell Sun

442
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
to keep his distance.

443
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,240
You two come downstairs.

444
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
Let's meet at the north gate.

445
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
We can buy some pork belly

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,680
for Uncle.

447
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,120
Okay.

448
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,000
Come on.

449
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,000
Payday is still two weeks away.

450
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,040
It's okay. I'll treat you guys.

451
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
Buy some pork knuckles.

452
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,400
Forget it.

453
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
Save your money.

454
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Let's go back and eat noodles.

455
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Are you taunting me?

456
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,160
Have we been discovered?

457
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,720
Be careful of his knife.

458
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,840
- You...
- Hey.

459
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
He has a knife.

460
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Dad, Mom.

461
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,000
Why didn't you tell us
your leader would come?

462
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,880
This is my dad, and this is my mom.

463
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,760
Hello.

464
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,560
Hello, Mr. Ding.

465
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,280
- Hello, Mr. Ding.
- Nice to meet you.

466
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Just call me Changhai.

467
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Since you are here,

468
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
come to our home and eat.

469
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
We are on a mission.

470
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,280
We have to go back to work.

471
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Come after work

472
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,680
to have dinner.

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,760
We'll wait for you.

474
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,720
All of you.

475
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Alright.

476
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,440
Let's go eat at Guozhu's home together.

477
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,720
Okay.

478
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,880
No problem.

479
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
What are you doing?

480
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,920
Stop cooking. The food is enough.

481
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,960
The food is coming.

482
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,120
The last dish.

483
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,080
Thank you, Mrs. Ding.

484
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Take a seat.

485
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
It's so sumptuous.

486
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,400
Make yourselves at home.

487
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,040
You have to do tasks,

488
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,280
so we won't drink.

489
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,360
Let's drink some tea.

490
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,720
- Come on.
- Thank you, Mr. Ding.

491
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Welcome to our home.

492
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,960
- I wish you good health.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ding.

493
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,400
Have some more.

494
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,960
Come on.

495
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,320
Let's eat.

496
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
Mr. Ding, we can do it ourselves.

497
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,400
Especially you, girl.

498
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
Look how thin you are.

499
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,880
Guozhu said you were good
at fighting. Is that true?

500
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,320
She's a fighting expert.

501
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,160
Really?

502
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,760
Mrs. Ding, I just practiced for fun.

503
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh.

504
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,480
Guozhu, she practiced for fun,

505
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,720
but she could fight so well.

506
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
Guozhu has been practicing fighting
since childhood.

507
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,120
But he is still not good at it.

508
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
He fights well.

509
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,840
I heard

510
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,360
there is a fighting competition

511
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
every year, right?

512
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,080
- Yes.
- Fighting competition.

513
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,280
- It's coming soon, isn't it?
- That's called

514
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,480
MMA tournament.

515
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,560
MMA tournament.

516
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,240
Let Guozhu participate.

517
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,960
No problem.

518
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,120
Go sign up for it.

519
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,480
Come on.

520
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
We're both uneducated.

521
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,720
So, we want Guozhu to be a success.

522
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,720
We forced him to study.

523
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,160
Unexpectedly, he was good at studying

524
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
but became timid.

525
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
He got more and more wimpy.

526
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
And he can't fight.

527
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,080
How can a policeman be like this?

528
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah.

529
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
The year he applied
to the police academy,

530
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,680
he was robbed by a few punks.

531
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,120
Really?

532
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Is that so?

533
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
He was robbed on the way.

534
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,120
They even robbed him of his bike.

535
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I sold two pigs to buy it.

536
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,360
I got it back a few days later.

537
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,600
Is this the point?

538
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,360
The point is

539
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,920
you were robbed of your bike.

540
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,760
And you are a policeman.

541
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,600
Right.

542
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,440
I was not even a police cadet
at that time.

543
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,520
True. Stop it.

544
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,480
Mr. Ding.

545
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
Guozhu is not that timid.

546
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,880
All members in our
Special Investigation Team

547
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,000
deal with big cases.

548
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,280
Only capable people can join the team.

549
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,080
Guozhu is excellent.

550
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

551
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,800
Guozhu did a great job today.

552
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,200
He is very clever.

553
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,040
That's my son.

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,760
Yes.

555
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,240
Guozhu is bold.

556
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,560
He just puts on a show.

557
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,840
You're great.

558
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
Enough.

559
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,880
Look. He's bad-tempered.

560
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,040
He's the toughest guy on our team.

561
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Come on, son.

562
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,720
He's so tough.

563
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,920
Just like a steel pillar.

564
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Shut up.

565
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,760
