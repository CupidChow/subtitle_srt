00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,630
Three days ago,

5
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,630
outside a market,

6
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,470
an old man collecting junk died.

7
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,470
There were a lot of people around.

8
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,230
It's said that before he died,

9
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,990
he was very agitated.

10
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,470
How could a junk collector

11
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,670
be doing drugs?

12
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,030
Well, not exactly drugs,

13
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,150
but he did die from meth.

14
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,070
What do you mean?

15
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,510
After meth showed up in Sheng City,

16
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,230
they formed
a Special Investigation Team as well.

17
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,030
They brought a drug expert
from the south to their place,

18
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,630
around your age.

19
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,640
From Yuedong?

20
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,280
From Kundu.

21
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,480
Kundu also has a drug problem.
Makes sense.

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,240
What makes sense?
They're just copying us.

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
I brought you to Halan from far away,

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Now they've done the same.

26
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,880
If that's not copying, what is it?

27
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,560
How old are you?

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
You're too old for this pettiness.

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,920
the residue in the old man's body.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,560

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Was the old man

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,280
using drugs?

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,120
The expert says he ingested it.

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
What?

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,320
Ingested meth can be deadly.

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
But it's in very small amounts.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Plus, he had some health issues.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,640
So he didn't make it.

and places she likes to go.

194
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,240
As much as you can.

195
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,520
Jin Fei.

196
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,480
Move fast.

197
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:49,840
Go.

198
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,600
Come on, Jin Fei!

199
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,880
- Hurry up!
- Faster.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,160
Quick.

201
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,720
Look,

202
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,240
I saw a really handsome guy

203
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
over there earlier.

204
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
In a white T-shirt.

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
He went that way.

206
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Which one?

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
So handsome.

208
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
Handsome, right?

209
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,200
I saw him too.

210
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,160
I'll make a phone call.

211
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
Special Task Force, Xin Tiegang.

212
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,920
Uncle, ask Bei to answer the phone.

213
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,920
One second.

214
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,040
Bei.

215
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Bei.

216
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
Come, your call.

217
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,560
Who is it?

218
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Seems to be Yao.

219
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Hello?

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,200
Something's off with Jin Fei.

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,320
At first,

222
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
I thought she was just in a bad mood,

223
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
acting differently from others.

224
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,520
Then I took a closer look.

225
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,920
She seems like,

226
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,280
according to what Ran taught,

227
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
like she's using drugs.

228
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,160
Jin Fei, using drugs?

229
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
I think so.

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
When we arrested Erjin before,

231
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,400
I talked to her.

232
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
She wasn't like this.

233
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,520
She was normal.

234
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,600
I suspect she tried drugs recently.

235
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,520
Got it.

236
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
Hai.

237
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Money.

238
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,680
Get lost.

239
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
Great, you're still here.

240
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,400
Why are you here so late?

241
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
Take a look at this.

242
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Songlin Police Station.

243
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,040
Jin Fei was drinking

244
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
near Wanhuang Hotel
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

245
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,520
Later that night,

246
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
someone saw her at the police station.

247
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,700
[Caller: Jin Fei,
report: Lin Jiang raped me]

248
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,420
[Family members of the complainant:
Jiang Yingzi, Lin Jiang]

249
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,220
[Action taken: Domestic dispute,
case dropped]

250
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,320
That rascal.

251
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,800
I'll blow him up.

252
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,720
Let me out. I'll kill him.

253
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,840
Calm down!

254
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,240
Relax.

255
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,880
Liu.

256
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Alright, it's okay now.

257
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,640
Officer,

258
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,760
can I get out for a day?

259
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,960
Just one day.

260
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,000
Half a day even.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,160
I promise I'll come back
after I'm done. I won't run.

262
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,080
Please.

263
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,680
Do you think it's possible?

264
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm begging you.

265
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm begging you.

266
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,200
I just have this one daughter.

267
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,440
Just one.

268
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,880
I've spoiled her since she was little,

269
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,840
and I never let her suffer.

270
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
I'm a thug; I deserve this.

271
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,240
But she isn't.

272
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,120
How dare that rascal do this to her?

273
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,080
How dare he?

274
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,920
If I were out,

275
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,760
who'd dare touch my daughter?

276
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
Who?

277
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
But you're not out.

278
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
You committed a crime,

279
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
a serious one.

280
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,840
You're locked up.

281
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
How can you protect her?

282
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
It's all my fault.

283
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,050
I failed Fei.

284
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,850
I'm the one to blame.

285
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,130
I've been hanging on for what?

286
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,250
I've been meaning to ask you the same.

287
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,010
For what?

288
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,730
You've been here for so long,

289
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,330
and never said a word.

290
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,170
Qin Yi is dead.

291
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,610
There's no point protecting him.

292
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,770
Then I figured it out.

293
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,810
You are doing this

294
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,250
because of Jin Fei.

295
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,170
Because Jiang Yingzi promised

296
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,050
to take care of Jin Fei,

297
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,930
you've been silent,

298
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,250
no matter what.

299
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,050
Jiang Yingzi

300
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,490
is the head of Lucifer Cartel.

301
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,370
She's Mr. Ma.

302
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,810
We've already found that out.

303
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,770
Jiang Yingzi was Qin Yi's boss.

304
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,530
She killed Qin Yi.

305
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,290
Yet you still didn't implicate her.

306
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,810
Because Jiang Yingzi promised you

307
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,890
to protect Jin Fei.

308
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,210
But in reality,
she's controlling you with Jin Fei.

309
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,530
You found all that out?

310
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,570
Jin Fei,

311
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,490
is a brave girl.

312
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,090
She was assaulted,

313
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,810
and her first reaction was to report it

314
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,050
and to accuse Lin Jiang.

315
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,090
But Jiang Yingzi,

316
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,170
she stopped it.

317
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,290
Just a few words,

318
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,410
and she twisted Lin Jiang's ra...

319
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,650
And she twisted the truth

320
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,090
into

321
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,010
a lovers' quarrel.

322
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,210
I'm the one to blame.

323
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,210
I shouldn't have trusted her.

324
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,490
Jiang Yingzi not only failed
to protect Jin Fei,

325
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,890
but she also
covered up Lin Jiang's crime.

326
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,770
You never pointed her out,

327
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,050
but through criminal investigation,

328
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,890
we confirmed her true identity anyway.

329
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,930
In the end, what you tried to hide

330
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,010
and protect

331
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,610
was all in vain.

332
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,290
The saddest part is your daughter.

333
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,490
She's so young,

334
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,570
yet she suffered so much harm.

335
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,370
So much.

336
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,370
That's enough.

337
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,850
Well,

338
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,370
the officer on duty that night
at the police station

339
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,570
was responsible.

340
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,330
Though it was labeled
as a lovers' quarrel,

341
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,250
the report

342
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,970
still stands.

343
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,850
I'll find Jin Fei.

344
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,690
If she still wants to accuse Lin Jiang,

345
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,210
I'll help her file a case immediately

346
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,650
and take it seriously.

347
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,530
I'll make sure she gets justice.

348
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,370
There's one more thing

349
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,210
I need to tell you.

350
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,610
Jin Fei,

351
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,690
that night,

352
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,490
was injected with a lot of drugs.

353
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,890
But don't worry.

354
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,490
We'll find her

355
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,650
and do our best to help her quit.

356
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,650
You have

357
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,770
my word.

358
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,290
Okay.

359
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,890
That's it for now.

360
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,330
Let's go.

361
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,370
How far have you gotten?

362
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,530
Do you have anything else to say?

363
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,370
Haven't caught Jiang Yingzi yet, right?

364
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,850
So, she successfully
transported the goods?

365
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,610
Do you know the route?

366
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,050
If I confess,

367
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,450
will it reduce my sentence?

368
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,130
Before the first trial,

369
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,570
if you provide

370
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,730
accurate

371
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,770
and valuable information,

372
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,730
I'll do my best to apply for it.

373
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,810
I promise you that.

374
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,850
Erjin,

375
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,330
get out early

376
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,930
to be with your daughter.

377
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,130
That is the only way

378
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,010
to protect her.

379
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,610
Before I got caught,

380
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,690
Mr. Ma

381
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,130
gave me a new route.

382
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,890
After I was arrested,

383
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,530
they probably got someone

named Long to replace me.

How are they transporting it?

389
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,290
By car.

390
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,090
We have checkpoints
on the highways and main roads.

391
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,410
How do they get past?

392
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,130
They said there's a way

393
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,490
that's so safe

394
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,170
that no one can detect it.

395
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,890
What way?

396
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,050
I don't know the details.

397
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,810
But I remember

398
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,650
Qin brought me a bag of clothes,

399
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,050
saying that was the way.

401
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,730
There were a few tracksuits.

402
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,090
When we were checking Yifeng,

403
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,650
they found those clothes.

404
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,770
Now,

405
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,410
they should still be
in the evidence room.

409

414
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,890

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,250
I suspect

417
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,810
they soaked the towels in meth solution

418

for transport,

419
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,810
to avoid detection.

the pushers

422
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,290

The pushers in Sheng City

429
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,930
were supposed to destroy the towels

430
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,490
after extracting meth.

431
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,970
But they got lazy

432
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,530
and just tossed them out.

433
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,930
That means

we've thoroughly checked
the towel manufacturer,

445

and found no issues.

Freshly produced towels are clean,

447
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,490

knows nothing about it.

Yes.

I watched those two trucks
enter Wanhuang.

574
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,240
They can't just disappear.

575
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Could Wanhuang be a decoy?

576
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,440
- No way.
- Impossible.

577
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,480
I checked the factory's order records.

578
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,080
Before Qin Yi got arrested,

579
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,040
Wanhuang Hotel's orders

580
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,360
were a third of what they are now.

581
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,480
Back then,

582
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,080
they used the Wanhuang logo.

583
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,600
But now,

584
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,120
there are no logos anymore.

585
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,880
Plus,

586
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,720
the timeline for drug towels

587
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,000
matches what Bai Ling and Long said.

588
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,600
And Xiaoguang

589
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
saw Long's car

590
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,680
enter Wanhuang

591
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,680
with the delivery trucks.

592
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,600
So, this place

593
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,280
is definitely

594
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
the drug towel distribution hub.

595
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,480
No doubt.

596
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,680
But it's gone now.

597
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,680
It must've happened
in those ten minutes in the parking lot.

598
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,440
Don't frown.

599
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,480
- Director Guan.
- Director Guan.

600
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,200
Zheng Bei.

601
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,640
Our Special Investigation Team

602
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,160
tracked the junkie's towels
in the garbage dump

603
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,080
to the pushers dumping them.

604
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,640
We're watching them now,

605
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,960
but haven't made a move yet.

606
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
Since this case started
in your jurisdiction,

607
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,600
both cities are merging the case

608
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,160
under your command.

609
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,760
We're waiting for your lead.

610
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,720
Director Guan,
you're giving us too much credit.

611
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,520
We just worked well together.

612
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,840
Look at Captain Wang,

613
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,480
his thoughts are clear as day.

614
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Didn't catch the pushers

615
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,240
to avoid spooking the bigger fish.

616
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,120
I'll leave the details to you.

617
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,880
You plan it,

618
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,000
and we will fully cooperate.

619
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
No problem, Director Guan.

620
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,080
We're family.

621
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,120
Just tell us what to do.

622
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,360
Sure.

623
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,240
No worries, Director Guan.

624
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,560
Alright, go back to work.

625
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,200
Okay.

626
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,440
Goodbye, Director Guan.

627
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,680
Any idea, Bei?

628
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
What's the plan?

629
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,240
We have to catch them,

630
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,200
but we need a pretext.

631
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,400
How are your acting skills?

632
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,840
I'm solid,

633
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,080
as good as Zhou Runfa.

634
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,720
The issue is my face

635
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,760
is too recognizable in Sheng City.

636
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
Not convenient.

637
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,080
How about your acting skills, Bei?

638
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I haven't been on camera in years.

639
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,640
But if I have to,

640
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,760
it's not impossible.

641
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,480
Just, my appearance fee is high.

642
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
For that,

643
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,920
Sheng City Special Task Force Canteen
can offer you whatever you want.

644
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,920
Wow, look at you showing off.

645
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,240
Let's make do, then.

646
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,760
- Alright?
- Let's just make do.

647
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,360
Okay.

648
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,800
Call Uncle

649
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
to add a couple of hearty dishes.

650
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,080
Uncle?

651
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,880
Which uncle?

652
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,880
My master. He has retired.

653
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,080
He's back on a part-time basis.

654
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,200
Feels familiar.

655
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Very familiar.

656
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,640
Alright, if Uncle's mentioned,

657
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,400
today,

658
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,360
why not introduce everyone

659
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,920
properly today?

660
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,520
- Sure, sounds good.
- Let's do it.

661
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,280
Pan, forensic expert.

662
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,560
Hello.

663
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,920
Zhou Xi, my disciple.

664
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,720
This one here feels especially familiar.

665
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,840
And don't mess with her.

666
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,280
Look at her build.

667
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,920
She's our local Sanda champion.

668
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,840
A real tough one.

669
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,960
Right, Yuan?

670
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,560
Low profile.

671
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,360
Isn't that Yao?

672
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,160
Wu Gang, Mr. Wu.

673
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,920
No introduction needed.

674
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,200
Over there.

675
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,440
After Erjin was caught,

676
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,920
Jin Fei moved here.

677
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,240
Let's go.

678
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,840
Drink something.

679
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,080
You can't go on an empty stomach.

680
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,200
That's not what I want.

681
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,640
You know what I want.

682
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,360
Jin Fei, you shouldn't be like this.

683
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,000
What should I do, then?

684
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,160
You deserve a better life.

685
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,320
A better life?

686
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,960
Like yours?

687
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,840
You like me, don't you?

688
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,160
Get me some Lucifer.

689
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,000
Or ecstasy,

690
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,320
anything.

691
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,520
Get it for me,

692
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,880
and I'm yours.

693
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
What are you doing?

694
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,360
Just give me a little.

695
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,000
Just a little.

696
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,200
Just a little.
