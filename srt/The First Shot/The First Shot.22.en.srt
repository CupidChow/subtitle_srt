Back when Song Kang was the boss
in Halan,

he had several mistresses.

and ran with him.

105
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,160
But they were using fake IDs,

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,000
so we couldn't figure out who they were.

107
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,760
Given what we know now,

108
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,680
it's Jiang Yingzi.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,680
Both Jiang Yingzi and Song Kang

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,600
left Halan in 1983.

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
The timeline fits.

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,240
When Song Kang was arrested in Huazhou,

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,880
there was a woman with him.

114
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,080
But since she wasn't involved in drugs,

115
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
she was released.

116
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
If they were together

117
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,160
from 1983 to 1993,

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,680
then Mao must be Song Kang's child.

119
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Jiang Yingzi's quite an actress.

120
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,200
She looks like

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
a regular housewife,

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,920
but she was the mistress of a drug lord.

Is it possible

126
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,920
that before Song Kang was arrested,

127
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Jiang Yingzi already had the recipe
for meth?

128
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
She might've modified it,

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,400
which led to the creation of Lucifer.

130
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,400
That's very likely.

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,360

132
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,960
We never considered the possibility

133
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
that Mr. Ma

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
could be a woman.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,760
Li Wenlong was Song Kang's trusted man.

136
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,720
After he got out from the prison,
he avenged Song.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
Such a person wouldn't abandon

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120

139
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600

we'll keep a close watch
on Li Wenlong and Jiang Yingzi.

142

Given their past relationship,

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
and the fact that they're both in Halan,

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,800

189
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,400
I care about him

190
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,520
because I do feel I owe him.

191
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,960
As his big brother,

192
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm responsible
for guiding him to be a good man.

193
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,680
But

194
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
if one day,

195
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
I find out he's really involved,

196
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
then he's breaking the law.

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,920
If I'm forced to choose
between being a good brother

198
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,760
and a good police,

199
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,440
I have to choose being a good police.

200
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
This isn't something I can get wrong.

201
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,680
Alright, stop sweeping.

202
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Let's go home.

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll go talk to him tomorrow

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,840
and see what's going on.

205
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Hai.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You come to see my godfather?

207
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,720
No.

208
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Hai,

209
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,240
I come specifically to see you.

210
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
Me? What's up?

211
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,680
I've got a big deal,

212
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
and I need someone like you

213
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,840
to back me up.

214
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
You're overestimating me.

215
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,960
What are you talking about?

216
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,520
Hai,

217
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,680
with your fighting skills

218
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,000
working at the skating rink
is a waste of talent.

219
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,600
At least, it's a decent job.

220
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm done with fighting.

221
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360
I get it.

222
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
If there is money to earn,

223
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
who wants to fight, right?

224
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,400
Hai, if you agree

225
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
to join me,

226
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,480
what Qin Yi gave you,

227
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
I'll pay you exactly the same.

228
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,360
What do you say?

229
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
What kind of deal are you talking about?

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
Sounds big.

231
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
Shitou,

232
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
bring it out.

233
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
Take a look.

234
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,640
This is called "Scholar's Pill."

235
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,600
It boosts concentration.

236
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,040
Take one,

237
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,400
you can sleep
for only two or three hours a day

238
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,800
without feeling tired.

239
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,480
Sanghong,

240
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,480
this isn't medicine, is it?

241
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
Hai, you're sharp.

242
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
It does have a component

243
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,520
that's in meth,

244
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
but it's in very small amounts.

245
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I didn't know you had the guts

246
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,200
to mess with meth.

247
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
You know what happened to

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,320
my godfather and Erjin.

249
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,640
And you still mess with this stuff?

250
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,160
That's different.

251
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,560
They were dealing drugs.

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
This is medicine.

253
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
Of course cops catch them.

254
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
This medicine

255
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,680
has a different target people.

256
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,040
It is sold

257
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,240
to stressed-out high schoolers.

258
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,440
The students should thank us
for selling it.

259
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,560
Cops focus on junkies,

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,520
not students.

261
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,480
Selling drugs to kids?

262
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,840
Shame on you.

263
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,040
Now you're the one to say that?

264
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
Calling Qin Yi your godfather,

265
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,240
but did you help him
when he was in trouble?

266
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,160
You ran away, didn't you?

267
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,320
These days, money is everything,

268
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,440
Hai.

269
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't work with you.

270
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,840
Find someone else.

271
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
It's your honor to be part of us.

272
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,960
Don't push your luck.

273
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
Didn't you say you don't fight anymore?

274
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
Let's see if you fight back.

275
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,680
That's it?

276
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
You're really not fighting back?

277
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
Stop. That's a cop.

278
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,040
- Run, quick!
- What are you doing?!

279
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
What are you doing?!

280
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Are you alright?

281
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,400
No worries.

282
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Who are they?

283
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Just some punks.

284
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,920
They worked for Yifeng.

285
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
They tried to recruit me,

286
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,160
but I refused.

287
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,080
You silly boy.

288
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
Why didn't you fight back?

289
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,200
I promised you

290
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,520
I wouldn't fight. I'll work hard.

291
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,320
That wasn't fighting.

292
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,600
That was self-defense.

293
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
If I fight back,

294
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,400
since they are so weak,

295
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,880
I'll be accused
of excessive self-defense.

296
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
Quit showing off.

297
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,400
I'll drive you home. Let's go.

298
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
Let's go.

[Youth Palace, Jiangtie District, Halan]

300
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,680
How's it, Mao?

301
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
You know what?

302
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,080
You're really fair-skinned.

303
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,360
Uncle!

304
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,520
Didn't I tell you

305
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
not to go with strangers?

306
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,160
He said he's your good friend,

Spit it out.

311

Hai, that's too much.

your uncle is right.

315

Once the bubble gum doesn't taste sweet,

316
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,360
spit it out.

317
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't swallow it.

318
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
You could choke to death.

Wouldn't that be a sad story, right?

They want to take over
the whole Halan market,

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,680
But this is all the product

377
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,840
you've got?

378
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,720
Don't worry.

379
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,360
I run a pharmaceutical company.

380
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,160
We'll have plenty of supply.

381
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
Hai,

382
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,520
I heard from Sanghong

383
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,160
that you had some conflict
at the cemetery,

384
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
and a cop helped you out?

385
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
What do you want to say?

386
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm serious

387
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
about making money with you,

388
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,840
so I need to clear something up.

389
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
If you're really close with a cop,

390
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,560
and you betray me, what then?

391
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,080
That cop's name is Zheng Bei.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
He's the head
of Halan's criminal investigation team.

393
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,080
He's the one who sends Erjin in.

394
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,480
He came to me

395
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,160
because my brother-in-law
killed a woman.

396
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Xin, you're overthinking it.

397
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
How could someone like us

398
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,040
make friends with cops?
That'd be suicide.

399
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,120
I knew

400
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,320
it had to be a misunderstanding.

401
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
Don't blame me for being cautious.

402
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
We're serious here,

403
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
so we've got to be careful.

404
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
I understand. Cautious is the way.

405
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,280
But, Xin,

406
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
you said there's plenty of this.

407
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,640
All I see is this little bit.

408
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,040
How do I trust you?

409
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Now do you believe me?

410
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,240
Yes.

411
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
This is enough.

412
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,840
What's that gesture?

413
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm just happy.

414
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,840
Well...

415
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,440
Your way of expressing joy

416
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,760
is kind of weird.

417
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,160
Anyway, we're a good team.

418
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,520
Let's have a drink.

419
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,720
Come on.

420
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
Quick, police! Get down.

421
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,040
Don't move!

422
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,160
Down, don't move!

423
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,040
Down!

424
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,280
Jiang Xiaohai,
you called the police, right?

425
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,440
You sell drugs to kids.

426
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,400
You deserve it.

427
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,120
Be gentle.

428
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,000
Get up!

429
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Xin,

430
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
I really didn't buddy up to the cops.

431
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,280
But this is my big brother.

432
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,760
Alright, stop showing off.

433
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
Your gesture is indeed wired.

434
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
Cuff them. Take them away.

435
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,480
Move!

436
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Silence. Move!

437
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,080
Hurry up!

438
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,480
Hurry.

439
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,840
It's okay.

440
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,840
Don't panic. It's alright.

441
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,040
Well,

442
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
here's what we'll do.

443
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,280
Come with me to the station.

444
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
We'll take a statement,

445
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
and check on the child.

446
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Okay?

447
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,240
Leave it to us, alright?

448
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,200
Here.

449
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
It's okay.

450
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,440
Ma'am, follow me.

451
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,160
Come on, kiddo.

452
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,240
Grab your bag.

453
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,920
It's alright.

454
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
It's okay. Let's go.

455
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Is there anything left in the bag?

456
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Are any of your classmates

457
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,000
also taking this drug?

458
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,160
Besides me,

459
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,960
there seem to be five or six more.

460
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
Five or six more?

461
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,040
Kid,

462
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,520
I heard the dealer say

463
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,080
this isn't the first time you bought it.

464
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,160
Where did the previous ones go?

465
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
Did you take them all?

466
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Is there any left in your bag?

467
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,040
Sir, please don't take my medicine.

468
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
Without it, I can't study.

469
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,320
If my grades slip,

470
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,560
my parents will be so disappointed.

471
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,360
I can't let them down.

472
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
Kid, listen to me.

473
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,240
This isn't "Scholar's Pill."

474
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
It's a kind of drug.

475
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,600
Take too much of it,

476
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
and your brain will get messed up.

477
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,520
Do you understand?

478
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,360
I can't live without it.

479
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,120
I have to improve my scores.

480
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,040
I can't sleep.

481
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,880
Look,

482
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,520
calm down.

483
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,000
He is really here.

484
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Well, this matter...

485
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, well.

486
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,200
So young,
and you're already up to no good.

487
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,920
What are you doing?

488
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,840
- Jia, you really let us down.
- You are so young.

489
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,760
How dare you

490
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,240
take drugs?

491
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,600
You really let us down!

492
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
Alright, that's enough.

493
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
He's just a child.

494
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
He's been tricked. He's a victim.

495
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,440
How can you hit him

496
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
instead of comforting him?

497
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Why wasn't anyone else tricked?

498
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,240
Why only him?

499
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
All you do is looking for shortcuts.

500
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
How can you do well in school like this?

501
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,560
You've embarrassed us.

502
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
Calm down.

503
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
You're his parents, right?

504
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,680
You can't teach a child this way.

505
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
You're also responsible

506
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
for the way he is today.

507
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,000
He did this to improve his grades.

508
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,920
You should also

509
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,400
reflect on yourselves.

510
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,360
How can a police say that?

511
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,000
You didn't catch the criminals in time,

512
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,400
and now my kid's mixed up in this.

513
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,680
It's all your fault.

514
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,840
How dare you lecture me?

515
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,520
Move aside!

516
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,800
- What do you mean?
- What do you think?

517
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,400
- Watch your attitude.
- What's wrong with my attitude?

518
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Your kid ends up here

519
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,680
because you parents pushed him
to this point.

520
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,480
What attitude is that?

521
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,920
What?

522
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,600
- This is my attitude.
- Where is your boss?

523
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
- I'm going to file a complaint.
- My boss is right here.

524
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,000
- Okay, enough.
- Go ahead.

525
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
Let's stop the shouting.

526
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll complain her.

527
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm their boss.

528
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,800
Right now,

529
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,360
you all need to go to the station
to give a statement.

530
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,400
The child needs a medical exam.

531
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,560
Is that clear?

532
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,960
Come on, let's go.

533
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Go.

534
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,640
- I'll deal with you at home.
- No hitting.

535
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
You've really let me down.

536
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,680
No hitting.

537
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,320
This kid.

538
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,400
You really let me down.

539
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm telling you...

540
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
Sir, are you okay?

541
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,160
Did he do it?

542
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,400
Did he do it on purpose?

543
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,280
How could you be so careless?

544
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,400
It's obvious he did it on purpose.

545
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
It's okay, sir. I scolded him.

546
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,400
I scolded him.

547
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,960
Let's go.

548
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,880
You're a police officer, but I'm not.

549
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
I don't have to go easy on them.

550
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
You're my brother,

551
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,440
so you're a family member of police.

552
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Be clam. No next time.

553
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,840
Alright.

554
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
Xiaohai,

555
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,800
but really,
this time you've helped a lot.

556
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,920
I owe you one.

557
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
Oh, no worries.

558
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
If I hear anything again,

559
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,280
you'll be the first to know.

560
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Sure.

561
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
You've been spending all your time
with your sister and Mao?

562
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,040
If it weren't for this incident,

563
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
I wouldn't have known

564
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
that Wang Jianmin isn't Mao's father.

565
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,920
Where's the kid's real dad?

566
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,680
Who is it?

567
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,200
Never cared about the kid.

568
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,280
I haven't met him, either.

569
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I wasn't around

570
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
when he was with my sister.

571
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
Heard he wasn't a good guy.

572
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,160
He got into some trouble.

573
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
By the time I got out of prison,
and came back to Halan,

574
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,960
my sister was already married
to Wang Jianmin.

575
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,840
To me,
Wang Jianmin is my only brother-in-law.

576
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,040
Your sister's been through a lot.

577
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,240
I was in jail

578
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
during her hardest times.

579
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,920
I thought
things were finally looking up,

580
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,600
but then this happened.

581
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
You've got your job.

582
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,160
You can't stay with your sister
and Mao every day.

583
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
Does your sister

584
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,280
have any close friends?

585
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,920
Maybe you could ask them

586
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,440
to chat with her.

587
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
It'd help her more than we could.

588
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,400
She's been on her own
since she was young,

589
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,280
used to handling everything by herself.

590
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,480
Everyday, she just goes

591
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,800
between the pharmacy and home.

592
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
I've never seen her get close to anyone.

593
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,520
Xiaohai.

594
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
Yingzi.

595
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,640
You're just in time.

596
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
Help me crack these eggs.

597
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,760
Sure.

598
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,200
Where have you been?

599
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
I haven't seen you around.

600
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,920
Helping Zheng Bei catch
a group of drug dealers.

601
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,920
Drug dealers?

602
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,400
What kind of drugs?

603
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,600
That's not important.

604
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,760
What's important is
that on the way back,

605
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,440
he was grilling me

606
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,440
about you and Song Kang.

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,600
That guy's been dead for so long,

608
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,720
but we're still

609
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,000
stuck with his mess.

610
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,880
You're caught in the middle.

611
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm sorry for making things hard for you.

612
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,840
Don't say that.

613
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
You're my sister.

614
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,520
Yingzi,

615
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,080
if you hadn't met Song Kang

616
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
when you left home,

617
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,280
but Wang Jianmin instead,

618
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,520
maybe none of this would've happened.

619
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
There's no "if" in life.

620
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Without Song,

621
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,600
there wouldn't be Mao.

622
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,640
I never look back.

623
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,480
Yingzi,

624
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,600
maybe you should stop.

625
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't do this anymore.

626
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,320
Even if you stop now,

627
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,600
you've made enough.

628
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,280
Think about Mao's future.

629
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,920
Those guys believe in me.

630
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,160
They followed me back to Halan.

631
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,720
For the title of "Madam,"

632
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,080
I have to take care of them.

633
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
Besides,

634
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,960
even if I don't mess with drugs anymore,

635
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
I've already done enough
with those raw materials.

636
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,880
If I could stop,

637
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
I would've done that
when you first asked me to.

638
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
But Zheng Bei is already suspicious
of you.

639
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,240
Don't worry.

640
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,360
I won't let anything happen
to our family.

641
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,040
Xiaohai,

642
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
you and Zheng Bei,

643
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,120
are in different worlds now.

644
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,680
You can't be brothers anymore.

645
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,800
In the future,

646
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,800
you should keep your distance

647
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,760
to avoid getting caught in the middle.

648
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,480
Don't worry.

649
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,320
I know how to handle it.

650
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,720
I thought this "Scholar's Pill"

651
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,640
was linked to the Lucifer Group.

652
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,120
But there's no connection at all.

653
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
After its ingredients

654
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
were analyzed,

655
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,120
I knew that it wasn't made by Mr. Ma.

656
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
The purity is much lower,

657
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
and the production quality is inferior.

658
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,360
We've gone in circles

659
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,920
and ended up right back at the start.

660
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,840
Good thing we did,

661
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
or else many kids would've been harmed.

662
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,800
Let me ask you two something.

663
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
Here in the Northeast,

664
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,080
from primary to college,

665
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
what's the most memorable text

666
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,920
about drugs?

667
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,680
Text about drugs?

668
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,320
Yes.

669
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
There wasn't any.

670
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,280
Sure there was.

671
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,960
Destruction of opium at Humen.

672
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,280
Anything else?

673
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,240
If that's the case,

674
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,760
the Opium War.

675
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,800
Anything else?

676
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,040
I get what you're saying.

677
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,040
Let me tell you something.

678
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,720
When I was in junior high,

679
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,320
a kid was smoking,

680
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
and he got caught.

681
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
He was publicly reprimanded
by the entire school.

682
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,560
My mom found out about this,

683
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,080
and told me

684
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,720
"If you want to smoke, go ahead."

685
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,360
Wait, you were only 12 at that time.

686
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,200
Yes.

687
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,480
Then she added,

688
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,920
"But wait until you're 18."

689
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,920
What did she mean by that?

690
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,200
She said

691
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,760
kids are not developed well,

692
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
your lungs aren't fully developed,

693
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,480
and if you smoke too young,

694
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,520
your lungs will deform.

695
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,800
You won't be able to breathe,

696
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
and you'll suffocate to death.

697
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
That's just nonsense.

698
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
I didn't know any better then,

699
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,680
so I believed her.

700
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,920
The idea of suffocating is scary.

701
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,000
What happened afterward?

702
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,840
She kept saying that

703
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
until I developed

704
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,480
a psychological fear of smoking.

705
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm asking, did you ever smoke?

706
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,720
With that fear,

707
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,840
how could I?

708
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,160
I never liked cigarettes.

709
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
You just mentioned

710
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,520
the textbook's warning

711
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,200
about the harm of drugs,

712
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,840
and this immediately came to my mind.

713
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,080
Aside from catching drug dealers,

714
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,080
we police actually
have a lot of other things to do.

715
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,800
We should make sure that everyone

716
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,480
ingrains the harm of drugs

717
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,560
in their minds from a young age.

718
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,800
It's our responsibility to protect kids.

719
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,480
Xiaoguang, your mom's calling.

720
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,280
Quick, it's your mom.

721
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,680
We've been watching for days

722
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,440
and still haven't found any connection
between Li Wenlong and Jiang Yingzi.

723
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm thinking Jiang Yingzi

724
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,840
probably isn't sourcing from Yunhui.

725
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,440
But her business is huge,

726
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,920
so she must have more than one supplier.

727
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,880
There are so many raw material factories
in the city.

728
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,440
How can we make the screening
more efficient?

729
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,240
Li Wenlong just got out of detention,

730
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,720
so he's keeping a low profile for now.

731
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,680
It's alright.

732
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,120
I had Yao rent a place

733
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,240
near Future Pharmacy,

734
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,680
and I've applied
for surveillance equipment.

735
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,000
We'll listen in.

736
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,480
If she's involved in drugs,

737
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,760
she'll contact her supplier
sooner or later.

738
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,880
Where did you have fun?

739
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,000
None of your concern.

740
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,760
What's up?

741
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,680
Is the case not going well?

742
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,560
Nope,

743
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,480
it's going fine.

744
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,800
Why did your mom call you?

745
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,760
Did she send you money?

746
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,120
No.

747
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,160
My parents stayed out
to make more money,

748
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,880
so they didn't come back
for the Spring Festival.

749
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,720
They said they'd come
for the Mid-Autumn Festival,

750
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
but now they're backing out again.

751
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,360
They're earning money for you.

752
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,800
Sometimes,

753
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
I wonder if I'm adopted.

754
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,600
It feels like money is their real child.

755
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,160
You're right.

756
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,960
You probably are.

757
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,640
What are you talking about, Bei?

758
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,240
Hey,

759
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,440
why don't you

760
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,680
be with us at the Mid-Autumn Festival?

761
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,200
We'd be happy to have you.

762
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,920
Right, Bei?

763
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Of course. Spend it with us.

764
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
You'll spend it with us anyway.

765
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,520
There's no difference.

766
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,480
Furthermore,

767
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,840
my parents

768
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,400
already treated you like a son.

769
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
You know that, right?

770
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,800
I know.

771
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,320
You and Bei are nice to me.

772
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,440
You see me as a younger brother.

773
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,400
Oh my goodness.

774
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,280
Come on, forget about it.

775
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,000
Let's go.

776
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,280
Let's go to the night fair.

777
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,320
You should clear your mind.

778
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Let's go.

779
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,200
Well,

780
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,680
I'll join you.

781
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Count me in.

782
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,720
No.

783
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Why?

784
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,160
He's off duty now.

785
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,040
You should let your subordinates
have some private time.

786
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,920
So I can't hang out with you after work?

787
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
Nope.

788
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,760
"Nope."

789
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,640
Go ahead.

790
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,120
Go, trust me.

791
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,280
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Bei.

792
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
Go ahead.

793
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,800
You know what's going on.

794
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
Why cause trouble?

795
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
What kind of brother are you?

796
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,440
Trouble?

797
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
He's lucky to have me.

798
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,920
Given his slow brain,

799
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,800
without my help,

800
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,880
he'd never realize.

801
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,800
[Colorful Amusement]
No, that's too hard.

802
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,520
Not at all.

803
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,040
I want that one.

804
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,800
- Which one? The little blue horse?
- Yeah.

805
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Come on.

806
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,760
Sir!

807
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
- Sir, the little blue horse.
- Sir!

808
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,120
- We hit it right away.
- The little blue horse.

809
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
Here you go.

810
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,240
- What else do you want?
- I want that one too.

811
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,840
Sir!

812
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,120
The dog.

Zhao Xiaoguang.

814
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,040
You're really good at this.

815
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,640
Alright, no chili oil for me.

816
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,760
That Beijing All-Star concert,

817
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,000
you missed it, right?

818
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,880
I've got two tickets in Yuezhou.

819
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:32,840
Come with me?

820
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,280
You're so kind.

821
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Those tickets are expensive.

822
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,320
Forget it.

823
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,160
They're not expensive.

824
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,600
It's hard to find someone
who shares the same interests.

825
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,920
Don't listen to my brother.

826
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm not interested in dating right now.

827
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,120
I've heard about it.

828
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,520
Your childhood friend likes you,

829
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,760
and he's making things hard for you.

830
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,280
I'm just here to help you out.

831
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,360
I mean it. Why don't we give it a try?

832
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,760
Then that guy will give up.

833
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,440
Actually,

834
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,160
I used to see him as a brother.

835
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,000
But recently,

836
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,720
I realized I might actually like him.

837
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,960
If you like him,

838
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,680
why don't you just tell him?

839
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,360
You...

840
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,440
When did you start liking me?

841
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
Why didn't you tell me?

842
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,000
I've dropped so many hints.

843
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,640
You just couldn't get it.

844
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,080
When did you hint at anything?

845
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,000
I didn't notice at all.

846
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,840
Wait a second,

847
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,920
weren't you the one who liked me first?

848
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,360
How did this become me confessing?

849
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,880
Back at the hospital,

850
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,400
I got so worried,

851
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,160
and blurted out
that I wanted to marry you.

852
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,040
I said it with my back to you.

853
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,080
Now you're confessing to me

854
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,960
with your back to me too.

855
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,120
As the old saying goes,

856
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,560
everything happens for the best.

857
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,040
Hey buddy, give me a hand with this.

858
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,120
- Me?
- And this one too.

859
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,480
Nan.

860
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,880
Hey, I'm still here.

861
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Here, buddy,

862
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,360
this was all arranged by Bei.

863
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,920
Alright, you two,

864
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,720
mission accomplished.

Wishing you both a long and happy life.

866
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,160

867
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
What's that?

868
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,640
This is your unsung hero, Bei.

869
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,520
Xiaoguang, remember to treat us.

870
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,200
Well.

871
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,800
My brother never disappoints.

872
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,200
Great.

873
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,240
What kind of brother
sets up his own sister?

874
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,600
Let's go walk around some more.

875
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,160
Where's our big squid?

876
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Hey!

877
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,640
The cops already know

878
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,920
about me and Song.

879
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,160
You communicate with Long.

880
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,520
Tell him that anyone

881
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,760
who used to work for Song

882
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,880
should lie low for now
to avoid attracting attention.

883
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,760
Understood.

884
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,040
That deal from last time is done,

885
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,120
but Yunhui's supply has stopped.

886
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,680

889
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,080
wait for me on the couch for a bit.

890
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,200
Mommy will be right out.

891
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,600
Okay.

892
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,040
I'm already in contact
with a new supplier.

893
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
I'll let you know
as soon as it's confirmed.

894
