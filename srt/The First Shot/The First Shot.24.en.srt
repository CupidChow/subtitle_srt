It is Mid-Autumn Festival again.

5
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,710
The moon this year is even brighter.

6
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,750
Yes.

7
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,590
The Mid-Autumn Festival in 1997
is indeed different from usual

8
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,150
because Hong Kong

9
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,750
returned to the motherland

10
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,550
on July 1st this year.

11
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,950
Look at them.

12
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,950
Don't get him scalded.

13
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,110
Look at the moon.

14
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,950
It's so round.

15
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,510
When I visited my mom's grave
in my childhood,

16
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,430
my dad always told me

17
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,270
to bury him with my mom

18
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,550
after he died.

19
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,270
He wanted to return to his roots.

20
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,150
I laughed at him.

21
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,590
I said he was a scientist,

22
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,230
but he was so superstitious.

23
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,590
And then he said,

24
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,550
returning to one's roots
was not superstition.

25
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,870
No matter how fast and far

26
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,990
people goes,

27
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,750
they have to return home.

28
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
It's true.

29
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,670
- Bei.
- Yes.

30
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,710
- Come eat dumplings.
- Okay.

31
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,550
Mr. Gu, come eat dumplings.

32
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,910
Come on.

33
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,270
Enough.

34
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,790
Nan.

35
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,750
Hurry up.

36
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,270
Knock it off.

37
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,670
Let's go.

38
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,510
Let's eat dumplings.

39
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,150
Uncle.

40
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,950
Don't do that.

41
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,110
It's time to eat dumplings, so hurry up.

42
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,750
Alright.

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,590
That's more like it.

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,350
I'm coming.

45
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,070
Let me tell you,

46
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,790
that today's dumplings are great.

47
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,070
The stuffing is really delicious.

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,670
Those dumplings make me drool.

49
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,550
Where is Bei?

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,830
I saw him go upstairs.

51
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,750
I'll go get him.

52
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,870
This brat

53
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,830
went back to his room
as soon as there was work.

54
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,830
You two, stop messing around.

55
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,110

56
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,630
Say hello to everyone.

57
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,670
After we solve the case,

58
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,110
I'll go to Huazhou with Ran.

59
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,550
Let's have a good meal together.

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,070
Ran?

61
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,630
Gu Yiran. Who else could it be?

62
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,310
We all call him that.

63
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,790
He is incredible.

64
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,070
We all admire him.

65
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,790
It's still about Prof. Gu.

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,390
Yes.

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,230
Please put more effort into it.

68
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,870
Keep an eye on it.

69
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,630
What are you doing, Bei?

70
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,950
Come downstairs and eat dumplings.

71
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,950
What are you doing?

72
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,070
What took you so long?

73
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,230
Your brother's on the phone.

74
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,350
So you've been standing here?

75
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,510
Let's go for dinner.

76
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,550
What's the rush?

77
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,350
Well...

78
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,390
Alright.

79
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,870
Stop it.

80
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,670
Don't hem and haw.

81
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,590
So nagging.

82
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,150
You're both here just
to call me to eat dumplings?

83
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,670
Yes. Are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

84
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,710
Quick.

85
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,430
Let's go.

86
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,230
Let's go eat dumplings.

87
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,950
Hurry up.

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,030
Enough.

89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,230
Let me fill it.

90
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,230
Alright.

91
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,070
Sit down.

92
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,910
Let's eat.

93
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,710
Let's eat, Dad.

94
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,350
Okay.

95
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,990
Come on.

96
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,950
How about aunt?

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,030
She's coming soon.

98
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,910
Just a moment!

99
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,390
Let me toast you, Uncle.

100
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,150
Dad.

101
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,750
- Happy Festival.
- Thank you.

102
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,750
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

103
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,310
This is sweet.

104
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,350
We've been eating dumplings
all these days.

105
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
We eat dumplings at Spring Festival,

106
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,350
Winter Solstice,

107
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,710
Dragon Boat Festival,

108
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,030
and even Mid-Autumn Festival.

109
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,710
So? You don't like dumplings?

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,630
This is our custom.

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,110
Dumplings for parting,
and noodles for reuniting.

112
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,950
We are used to eat dumplings
at Chinese New Year and other festivals.

113
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,870
Get lost if you don't like it.

114
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,030
Of course I like.

115
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,350
Mr. Gu is from Huazhou.

116
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,230
They might not eat dumplings
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

117
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,630
Don't get me involved.

118
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,430
You know what?

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,150
I love these dumplings.

120
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,470
Especially the sauerkraut filling.

121
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,550
That's a specialty of the Northeast.

122
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,270
Yes.

123
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,790
Gu, this is for you.

124
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,030
My husband specially made it for you.

125
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Nan said

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
people in your hometown
all loved it, huh?

127
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,160
Yes.

128
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
This is my first time cooking it.

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Try it. See if it tastes authentic.

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
Uncle, you're amazing.

131
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
Thank you.

132
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
You're welcome.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
How does it taste?

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,800
Very nice.

135
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,360
Do you like it?

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,480
Yes. It's authentic.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,080
Mom, sit down.

138
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,080
Let's eat.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Wait.

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
What are you up to?

141
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,120
You can't take pictures of every meal.

142
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,320
You know nothing about it.

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm recording my good life.

144
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Alright. Let's eat.

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Let me propose a toast.

146
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
Stop it.

147
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,480
It's my turn.

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,080
What are you doing?

149
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,760
My dad is sitting here.

150
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
And you want to propose a toast.

151
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,400
Which department are you from?

152
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Alright, Bei.

153
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,600
He is enthusiastic.

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
Just let him be.

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Go ahead.

156
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
Well, he is rude.

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,240
My dad didn't speak.

158
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,360
But you got up and tried
to propose a toast.

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
Alright.

160
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
Just let him be.

161
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,600
Stand up. Go ahead.

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
Got it, Uncle.

163
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I'll cheekily propose a toast.

164
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,000
On this happy Mid-Autumn Festival Day,

165
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,280
I wish you good health,

166
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
good luck,

167
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,120
and a long life.

168
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
I wish your restaurant success.

169
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Let me toast you, Uncle.

170
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on.

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,360
What a good toast!

172
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,840
Well-done.

173
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,520
Very nice.

174
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,720
We have to start eating.

175
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Let's get started.

176
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
The dumplings are getting cold.

177
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,240
Come on.

178
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,160
Let's drink.

179
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,920
Listen, buddy.

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Take care of them

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
and wait for me to come back.

182
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,800
Wait for me to come back.

183
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
No problem, Mr. Lin.

184
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Don't go, Mr. Lin.

185
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
Drink more.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
Hello, ladies.

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,360
I bought you some wine.

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,400
Have fun. Help yourselves.

189
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

190
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,460
Mr. Lin, you're so generous.

191
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Mr. Lin, have a drink.

192
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
Let's play a game.

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,520
Drink a glass of wine,
and you can get a bill.

196
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes. I can drink.

197
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
You took too many.

198
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
Can you drink so much?

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,720
Miss, join us.

200
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
Drink a glass of wine,
and I'll pay you 100 yuan.

201
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,280
Come on.

202
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
Let's take some photos.

203
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Let's take some photos.

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Miss.

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
They all took photos.

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,040
Let's take a photo together.

207
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
Look at the camera.

208
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
Look at the camera.

209
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Look at the camera.

210
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Come on. Look at the camera.

211
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Jin Fei.

212
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Are you alright?

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Please forgive her, Mr. Lin.

214
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
We will drink with you.

215
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,200
Let me toast you, Mr. Lin.

216
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,400
Are you okay?

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,560
Sir,

218
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,200
please wake me up when we get there.

219
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,520
Are you sure?

220
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,240
Lin Jiang took her away.

221
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,470
Guys.

222
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,910
Don't touch me.

223
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,430
Stop!

224
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,990
Don't touch me.

225
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,030
Press her on the bed.

226
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,190
Go away.

227
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,710
Pin her down.

228
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,110
Go away.

229
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,790
Give her a shot.

230
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,750
Give her a shot.

231
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,470
Sober her up so that we can
have more fun.

232
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,350
Give her a shot to sober her up

233
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,670
and add to the fun.

234
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,790
You go away!

235
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,790
Now, you're submissive.

236
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,270
One, two, three,

237
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,510
smile.

238
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,750
The dumplings stick together.

239
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,830
They are overcooked, Mom.

240
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,910
I just picked one, and it broke.

241
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,990
Yes, overcooked.

242
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,870
Eat them while they're hot.

243
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,590
What is it this time?

244
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,310
Look.

245
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,190
This brat is so lucky.

246
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,590
Look. I made a pot of dumplings.

247
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,510
Only one of them has a coin in it.

248
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,030
He ate it.

249
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,910
Uncle, we make this only
at Spring Festival, don't we?

250
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,110
Why did you make it
at the Mid-Autumn Festival?

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,320
These dumplings may be
from the Spring Festival.

252
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Don't talk nonsense.

253
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,880
Both festivals

254
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,600
are for reunions.

255
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,920
Just celebrate them in the same way.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,640
Yes. It's finally a reunion festival.

257
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
Since Bei became the captain,

258
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,720
this is the first time he spent
the Mid-Autumn Festival at home.

259
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
I will come back
at every Mid-Autumn Festival.

260
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,920
I was just busy.

261
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,440
I will come home.

262
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Keep your word.

263
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
He is now a captain. He's an official.

264
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
Come on. I'm just a captain.

265
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,520
- That's an official position.
- Yes.

266
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,480
Well.

267
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,400
I solemnly decided

268
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,920
to give my good luck to Ran.

269
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
Come on. Your saliva is on it.

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
I just washed it.

271
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,000
My goodness.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,720
First,

273
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
I hope Ran

274
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,440
will be happy every day in Halan.

275
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,320
Second,

276
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,920
I hope Ran can solve big cases.

277
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,040
Third,

278
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,280
thank you for teaching me Cantonese.

279
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,040
This is the point, isn't it?

280
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
Then your tuition fee is too low.

281
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,440
It's the thought that counts, right?

282
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
Xiaoguang.

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Thank you for the good wishes.

284
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,720
But the good luck is yours.

285
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,720
Just keep it for yourself.

286
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
No, Ran.

287
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Do in Rome as the Romans do.

288
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,160
You're the guest.

289
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,240
Just take it.

290
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,680
Stop it.

291
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,880
Take it.

292
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,600
It's not easy to get a nickel

293
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
from Xiaoguang.

294
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,040
You've been through great danger
together in Sangang.

295
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,480
You're now close friends.

296
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,520
Just take it.

297
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,560
Alright.

298
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,640
Yes, Uncle.

299
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,320
You have no idea

300
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,040
how brave Ran was in Sangang.

301
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
He fought the enemies

302
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
with such a long stick.

303
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,160
I...

304
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Tell me before you take photos.

305
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
Let me pose.

306
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,000
Stop it. The film is not free.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,640
Zheng Nan, let me take
a family photo for you guys.

308
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,040
Good idea.

309
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay. Sounds great.

310
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,800
Then sit here.

311
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Sit down, all of you.

312
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Ran never disappoints.

313
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
Put everyone in the picture.

314
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,080
I'll count down from three to one.

315
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,080
It's a family photo, understand?

316
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Put us all in the photo.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
A family photo.

318
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
Can we all be put in the photo?

319
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
Sit still.

320
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,520
Three, two, one.

321
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Are you leaving?

322
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
Let's have a meal together.

323
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,800
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

324
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
Don't talk nonsense outside.

325
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Remember I have your photos.

326
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,240
Aunt, why are you here?

327
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,080
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Aunt...

328
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,800
Where is she?

329
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,320
Who do you mean?

330
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,080
Where is she?

331
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,520
What do you mean?

332
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,460
[Songlin Police Station]

333
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
Hello, what's the matter?

334
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
Did you drink and fight?

335
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,640
What exactly happened?

336
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,680
Someone raped me.

337
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,080
Wait a moment.

338
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,040
Name.

339
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Jin Fei.

340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,760
Age.

341
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,520
Twenty.

342
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Take a seat.

343
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,400
Drink some water and speak slowly.

344
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,680
Thanks.

345
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,680
There are no female cops
on duty tonight.

346
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,800
So only I can ask you.

347
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,120
Lin Jiang raped me.

348
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,200
Tell me

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,760
when and where it happened.

350
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,920
He even gave me...

351
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,400
Darling.

352
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,680
Darling.

353
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
Sorry, I was wrong.

354
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
I won't do it again.

355
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm really sorry.

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,040
I will correct my mistake.

357
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Let's go home.

358
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
What are you doing?

359
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
What happened?

360
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Officer,

361
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

362
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
My family had a meal together

363
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,640
and drank some wine.

364
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,600
This couple

365
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,080
quarreled during the meal

366
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,960
and even had a fight.

367
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,560
It's a festival.

368
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,200
Look. My wife slapped my face hard.

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,320
How are you related to her?

370
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm her aunt.

371
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,110
What's your name?

372
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,950
Jiang Yingzi.

373
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,230
She never suffered this before.

374
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Look at you.

375
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,600
How could you beat a girl?

376
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,560
Yes. Once you drank,
you would make trouble.

377
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,600
You fought after drinking

378
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,400
and ruined the family party.

379
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,800
We came all the way back

380
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,280
just to spend the festival
with our family.

381
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,560
Fei,

383
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
You know,

384
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
he is already in poor health.

385
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,560
Yes, it's all my fault.

386
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
It's all my fault.

387
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
I shouldn't have said that.

388
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,040
Officer,

389
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,480
I just love to talk nonsense

390
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,840
after drinking.

391
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,560
I didn't mean to beat my wife.

392
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,480
Your name is Lin Jiang?

393
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,320
Yes.

394
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
What else did she tell you?

395
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,120
Is what he said true?

396
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,080
Fei.

397
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,600
Listen to me.

398
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't make trouble.

399
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
Think about your dad.

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,560

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
I...

404
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,360
I was just angry.

405
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,600
Darling, I was wrong.

406
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,320
I promise I will correct my mistake.

407
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,880
Let's go home.

408
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,160
Sorry.

409
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,440
Let's go, Fei.

410
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
Look at you guys.

411
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,200
Sorry to trouble you.

412
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Officer,

413
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,240
this is bad for a girl.

414
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,240
Can you...?

415
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
Do you know one has to take
responsibility for lying to police?

416
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Yes. I'm sorry.

417
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,080
I'll go back and criticize them.

418
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm so sorry.

420
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,240
Fei.

421
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,880
Where am I?

422
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,640
Why do you park here, Aunt?

423
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Let's go back to Wanhuang
and eat something. My treat.

424
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,880
It's a happy ending.

425
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,560
The matter was settled smoothly.

426
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,520
How did I act just now?

427
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,960
Very well, right?

428
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,360
What's wrong?

429
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,320
It was solved perfectly, wasn't it?

430
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,240
Why the fuss?

431
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,760
I slept in the car
and didn't notice you.

432
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,600
True.

433
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
It's not easy to find a driver
at a festival.

434
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,280
Don't give me attitude.

435
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,920
It's no big deal.

436
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Fei,

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
it's all over now.

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Don't worry.

That rascal

440
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,000
won't touch you again.

442
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,320
I won't harm you.

443
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
I promised your father

444
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,840
I would take good care of you.

and this to your master.

452
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
You're giving all the mooncakes away?

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
That's what I should do.

454
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
By the way, carry this TV

455
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,760
upstairs later.

456
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll do it right now.

Be careful.

458
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,640
Uncle and Aunt, happy holidays!

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,680
Welcome to our home,

but there is no need to bring gifts.

461
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,600
That's what I should do.

462
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Have you had breakfast?

463
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,600
I'll cook for you.

464
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Don't bother, Aunt.

465
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm going to work.

466
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,880
So early?

467
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,320
My work is now very regular.

468
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,800

469
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,000
It's a good habit.
You have to stick to it.

470
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Alright, I'll take it.

471
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
- Put them in the back.
- Okay.

Xiaohai,

473
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
you're getting more and more sociable.

474
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
You even prepared gifts.

475
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,720
It's a festival anyway.

476
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
How much did you earn?

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,880
You bought so many things.

478
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,400
It's okay. I just got my paycheck.

479

I wanted to bring them over last night.

480

Then a friend asked me to drink,
and I got drunk.

481
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,840
Don't do it again.

482
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,280
No need to buy us gifts.
We're just like family.

Where did your dad buy it?

500
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,160
It's just a box of mooncakes.

501
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Why did you ask for so many details?

502

too many mooncakes at home

Lamb and lamb legs.

569
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,680
They're all food and drinks.

570
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,840
I'm going to visit my relatives.

571
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Can I open the wine bottle?

572
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,440
Yes.

573
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,800
It's strong liquor.

574
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,960
You can go. Thanks for your cooperation.

575
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,760
The bottle is open. Just take it.

576
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,800
Leave quickly.

577
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Come on. The next one.

578
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,180
[Halan Public Security Bureau]

579
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,480
We've been checking for five days.

580
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
But we can't find anything.

581
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,920
Jiang Yingzi hasn't made any move yet.

582
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,920
I almost turned
the car over to check it.

583
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't know if they're going
to transport the goods.

584
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,360
Since they have goods,
it's just a matter of time.

585
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,440
They are in a hurry now.

586
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,960
We have to be calm.

587
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,360
Uncle is right.

588
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,760
They may take action at any time.

589
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,280
We can't let our guard down.

590
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,840
I'm just hungry.

591
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,840
I get depressed when I'm hungry.

592
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Then eat more.

593
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,440
You're all here.

594
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,400
- Bei.
- Bei.

595
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,480
Oh, buns. Good.

596
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,360
Uncle, pack some buns for me.

597
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,400
Mr. Gu, go on a business trip with me.

598
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,160
What's going on?

599
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,920
What's wrong?

600
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,800
Where are you going?

601
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Meth was found in Sheng City.

602
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,080
- What?
- What?

603
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,280
Lucifer?

604
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,920
Yes.

605
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,080
No way.

606
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,840
Only Mr. Ma has Lucifer.

607
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,400
Have they transported it already?

608
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,600
How could it be?

609
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,920
We blocked all the ways.

610
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Maybe we just blocked

611
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,600
all the ways we know.

612
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,160
Now,

613
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,560
they have transported the drugs out.

614
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,680
Uncle, just pack a box of buns.

615
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,520
Alright. But it's
over 500 kilometers away.

616
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,720
Are you leaving now?

617
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,240
Yes, we'll be there at dawn.

618
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,920
Don't slack off, everyone.

619
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,760
Keep watching.

620
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,680
Be careful.

621
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,920
- Drive slowly, Bei and Ran.
- Take care, Bei.

622
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,880
