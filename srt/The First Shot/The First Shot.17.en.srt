00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
who dare to buy Lucifer
and have the money for it.

188
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,840
If it appears, we'll definitely
hear about it.

189
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,800
But the people we sent out
haven't heard anything.

190
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Exactly.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,280
We haven't
received any information at all.

192
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Looking at the current situation,

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
this drug trafficking ring

194
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,880
seems to have contacted
a large number of pushers

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,880
and spread the goods quickly
within a short time,

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,000
without leaking any information.

197
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,000
This is a huge operation.

198
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
He must have been preparing
for a long time.

199
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
So Ran's assumption is spot on.

200
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,320
Mr. Ma had already given up on Qin Yi.

201
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,880
He had precisely timed this.

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,520
We captured Qin Yi

203
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,080
and destroyed the drug factory.

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,560
When we turned back to look for Lucifer,

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,000
he had already handed it over
to those pushers.

206
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,040
Even if we catch them now,

207
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,720
we'll only get small batches
of the product.

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,120
On the bright side,

209
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,880
catching those
who sell the small batches

210
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,360
might lead us
to the mastermind behind it.

211
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,760
Didn't yesterday's drugged driving case

212
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
provide us with a clue?

213
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Yes, it did.

214
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
But what does that change?

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,600
The drugs were sold.

216
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
People used them.

217
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,680
And someone drove
under the influence and killed a person.

218
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,840
If we had found out earlier,

219
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
wouldn't that old lady downstairs

220
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
have avoided sitting
in front of the police station

221
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
holding a photo?

222
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Go back to the hospital

223
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
and find out

224
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
who his supplier is.

225
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,400
The brat hasn't woken up yet.

226
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,960
So what?

227
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,280
He drove under the influence
and killed someone.

228
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Do I need to wait for him to wake up?

229
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,360
Yes, I'll go file a report right now.

230
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,160
I heard you lost your temper earlier.

231
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,760
No, I didn't.

232
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,440
Didn't you?

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
As a detective,

234
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
you see a lot of pitiful people

235
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
and hateful things.

236
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,280
It's normal to throw a tantrum.

237
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
They can do that,

238
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
but I can't.

239
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,120
As a team leader, as the big brother,

240
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,600
if I can't even control myself,

241
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,480
how can I teach them?

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,720
But don't put so much pressure
on yourself.

243
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,880
It's my nature.

244
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Is it natural, or is it because of Lele?

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,560
It's been years.

246
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,040
But you still remember that, don't you?

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
You blame yourself

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
for Lele's death.

249
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,360
Because you failed once
as a big brother,

250
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
you demand

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
perfection from yourself,

252
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,960
thinking any mistake
would let down the younger ones

253
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,080
who call you big brother.

254
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,040
Right?

255
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,080
Brother.

256
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Brother Zheng Bei.

257
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Brother.

258
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,200
Brother Zheng Bei.

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
What can I do?

260
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
I'm fine with it.

261
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,480
You're fine with it?

262
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
Who are you

263
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
putting on

264
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,400
this carefree act for?

265
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
Let me tell you, Zheng Bei,

266
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,160
guilt will crush you sooner or later.

267
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Didn't you always tell me

268
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
to stop worrying about others?

269
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
What's the matter?

270
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
Caught my habit?

271
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
Yeah.

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Everyone has something
they can't let go of.

273
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,520
Let's not judge each other.

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Let's both keep it bottled up.

275
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm off to interrogate
that drugged driver.

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Go ahead.

277
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,880
Behave yourself.

278
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Get away!

279
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
You dare bite my kid?

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,120
You deserve it!

281
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
What's going on here?

282
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,520
Be careful.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,680
Madam,

284
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,880
are you a dog or something?

285
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,240
More aggressive than a dog.

286
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
That's outrageous.

287
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,120
Calmed down yet?

288
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Guozhu, get up.

289
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
Madam, are you okay?

290
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm okay.

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,880
Why is he grinding his teeth?

292
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,800
Mom,

293
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
why didn't you say you were coming?

294
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
What are you talking about?

295
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,120
Do I need to report before I come?

296
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,640
Look at you, acting like a fool.

297
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,680
You're a big guy.

298
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,000
But you were beaten like that by him.

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,520
Aren't you embarrassed?

300
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
How useless!

301
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,120
Come on, Uncle.

302
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,760
When he's still sober,

303
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,920
quickly get the urine test done.

304
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,560
Hurry up and go.

305
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll be here. Go ahead.

306
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,440
Go. Behave yourself.

307
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,040
Loser.

308
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,520
Who are you calling a loser?

309
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,600
Madam.

310
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
It's not your place
to talk about my son.

311
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Madam,

312
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
drug users often lose control
of their emotions.

313
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,040
And they tend to be self-deprecating.

314
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
He's talking about himself.

315
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,480
I thought he was talking about Guozhu.

316
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,640
Well, I'll go back to work then, Madam.

317
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,160
Okay, you go ahead.

318
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,840
Guozhu.

319
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,440
Go ahead.

320
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't worry.

321
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,840
Let me introduce myself.

322
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,640
My name is Xin Tiegang.

323
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm in charge of logistics here.

324
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh,

325
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,600
and the kids all call me Uncle.

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,680
Uncle?

327
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
So you're Uncle?

328
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,800
Yes.

329
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,040
Guozhu always mentions you.

330
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,960
He says you're very kind
and take good care of them.

331
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,080
These kids

332
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
are all like my own children.

333
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes.

334
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,000
Actually, Guozhu is really good.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,480
Oh, crap. Didn't you
see what just happened?

336
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,280
He's so...

337
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,960
Uncle,

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,720
I speak too harshly sometimes.

339
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,680
It's okay.

341
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
I understand.

342
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm just...

343
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
It's a mother's concern.

344
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes.

345
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
I can do it.

346
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I can do it.

347
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Guozhu.

348
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
Guozhu, come here.

349
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,880
Ran.

350
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Are you alright?

351
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,560
I'm fine.

352
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,040
Crying won't solve the problem.

353
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
Then you cry for a bit.

354
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,720
Do you want me to cry or not?

355
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,880
Ran,

356
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,320
am I really that useless?

357
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,640
No, you're not.

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Otherwise, Zheng Bei
wouldn't have chosen you.

359
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,840
Right?

360
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,800
He just needed a forensic officer,

361
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
and I happened to be the right fit.

362
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,880
Well, I'm a good fit too.

363
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
You guys chase criminals,

364
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,440
and I'm the one being chased
by criminals.

365
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,880
My legs got injured from falling

366
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,600
while being chased.

367
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,120
Guozhu,

368
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,760
don't underestimate yourself.

369
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,680
Not everyone is capable

370
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,120
of handling a microscope.

371
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,440
Don't mock me, Ran.

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,160
But who would have thought
that after becoming a policeman,

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,440
I'd still be a coward.

374

In their eyes, I'm nothing.

377
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,360
your work is for solving cases for now.

Courage isn't hard to build.

379
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,760
I'll help you think of a way.

380
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,960
Alright, get up.

381
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160

You're indeed from the south.

Your skin is fair.

393
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,720
Madam,

394
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
can I change the curtains?

395
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,080
Go ahead if you want to.

396
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,360
And this bed...

397
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,920
This bed is brand new.

398
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
No one's ever slept in it.

399
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,680
I don't need it here.

400

This bed is great.

401
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,560
Why wouldn't you need it?

402
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,240
The lighting in this room is very good.

403
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm planning to turn it into a study.

404
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,520
Young man, you must be well-educated.

405
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,640
How about I set you up with some girl?

406

Oh, I didn't see that.

408

Young man, what do you do for a living?

411
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
Isn't the economic situation
in the South better than here?

412
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,800
People here are more straightforward.

413
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,880

Feeling the warmth
and heartbeat of another person

Yes.

495
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,120
Stop!

496
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,040
Where are you going?

497
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm afraid Nan might
get nervous over there.

498
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
Just finish the noodles before you go.

499
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,160
Oh man, you might choke like this.

500
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,920
It's yours now.

501
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Silly boy.

502
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,680
That person will never know.

503
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,080
You'll never be heartbroken.

504
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,560
He's happy, so you're happy.

505
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,440
Mr. Gu,

506
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,200
that's not how you translate it at all.

507
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,800
It's totally off.

508
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,080
I'm so tired of you teaching me.

509
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,360
Zheng Nan,

510
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,800
if you're tired,
you should just go home and sleep.

511
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll have some water.

512
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,240
Who's it?

513
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
Why are you here?

514
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,200

516
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,320
So I came to check on you.

517
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh, Nan is here too?

518
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,240
Zheng Nan,

519
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,360
Xiaoguang, and I
have some work to discuss.

520
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
Why don't you head home first?

521
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,360
No, I won't.

522
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,320
We have a case to discuss here.

523
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,040
If Bei finds out you're interfering
with official duties...

524
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,040
Okay, fine.

525
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
I'll go.

526
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,640
So annoying.

527
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,160
Goodbye, Mr. Gu.

528
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,720
Take care, Zheng Nan.

529
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,600
Don't be like that.

530
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,400
We didn't do anything.

531
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,760
Tell me.

532
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,560
Why does she like
spending time with you?

533
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,960
I can understand and speak it well.

534
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,720
What are you talking about?

535
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,520
Wait, what were you two just
talking about?

536
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,240
Why did she come to see you?

537
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
Translate? What?

538
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,120
I was just casually asking.

539
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Casually asking.

540
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
Alright, stop explaining.

541
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,320
The more you explain,
the worse it sounds.

542
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,880
Everyone knows

543
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,440
about my little crush.

544
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,360
Xiaoguang,

545
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,560
I have an idea.

546
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,240
I'll teach you Cantonese

547
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
so that you can watch movies with her.

548
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,800
You translate it for her.

549
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,720
Are you trying to help me, Ran?

550
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,480
Of course.

551
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,480
This is a laser CD player I brought
from Huazhou.

552
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
Great sound quality,and low distortion.

553
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,640
You can listen to Cantonese songs first.

554
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,480
Get familiar with it.

555
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,480
This is the latest model?

556
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,760
But, Ran,

557
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,920
this is so brand new.

558
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,400
I feel bad accepting it.

559
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,920
If you feel bad accepting it,

560
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,360
then why are you putting it
in your pocket?

561
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm just seeing where it fits best.

562
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,280
I was just checking it out.

563
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
A good craftsman needs the best tools.

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,280
Take it.

565
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,960
Ran, how about this?

566
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,400
You teach me Cantonese songs first.

567
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,960
Don't start with those tongue twisters.

568
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
Songs?

569
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,320
Alright, let's start with numbers.

570
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
Repeat after me.

571
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Three, nine, four, zero, five, two.

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Three.

573
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,120
Three.

574
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
Nine.

575
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,080
Four.

576
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,960
Zero.

577
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,080
Five.

578
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,960
Twa.
[*Wrong pronunciation]

579
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,960
Three, nine, four, zero, five.

580
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,360
Twa.

581
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,400
What's "Twa?"

582
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:30,960
One.

583
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,080
Two.

584
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,000
Two.

585
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,020
- It sounds like "One?"
- Open up your mouth.

586
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,400
Stick your tongue out.

587
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,480
Three, nine, four, zero, five, two.

588
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,960
Three, nine...

589
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,240
Four.

590
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,320
Ran,

591
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,240
are you messing with me?

592
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,560
I've been practicing all morning
facing a tree,

593
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,040
like an idiot.

594
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,200
Drop the "like."

595
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,960
The nine tones and six pitches
of Cantonese are fundamental.

596
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,280
Keep practicing. Come on.

597
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,880
Three, nine, four, zero, five, two.

598
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,720
Three.

599
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,520
Three, nine, four, zero, five, two.

600
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,880
Good news.

601
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
We caught the person.

602
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,560
Last night,

603
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,480
the drugged driver confessed the pusher.

604
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,760
Bei arrested them in the early morning,

605
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,040
and now they have been brought back.

606
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
It had to be our Bei.

607
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
All those trips to the hospital
weren't in vain.

608
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
Alright, let's focus on work first.

609
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,120
Let's practice again tonight.

610
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,440
Ran,

611
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Uncle said you two came here
before dawn.

612
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
What are you talking about here?

613
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,680
Teaching this idiot Cantonese.

614
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
Three, nine, four, zero, five, twa!

615
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,400
Just go.

616
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,360
Ran,

617
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,280
you're always helping Xiaoguang.

618
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,960
When will you help me?

619
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,640
Let's talk about it tonight, okay?

620
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,760
What is it?

621
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Don't let anyone else see this.

622
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,880
Listen to it by yourself at night.

623
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
Three, nine, four.

624
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Three, nine, four.

625
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,560
Zero, five, two.

626
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,560
Siliang?

627
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,360
So he sold the drugs

628
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,840
to those drugged drivers, right?

629
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,600
Yes.

630
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,560
I've arrested this guy before.

631
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,720
He used to sell ecstasy.

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Not sure when he started
dealing Lucifer.

633
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
But he's just a small fry.

634
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,240
I don't think we'll get much out of him.

635
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,680
Let's interrogate him first and see.

636
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,880
I wasn't the one who hit the person.

637
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,640
You can't pin that on me.

638
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
You didn't hit the person,

639
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,640
but the guy who did was on drugs,

640
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,280
and that's why he hit someone.

641
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Where did the drugs come from?

642
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,920
I sold them.

643
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,040
That's right.

644
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,040
Officer,

645
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,920
I warned that guy before.

646
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,160
I told him not to take so much at once.

647
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,160
And he should do it behind closed doors.

648
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,440
That's just common sense.

649
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,560
Who knew that guy...

650
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
Common sense?

651
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
What common sense?

652
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,360
Is it in the textbook?

653
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,920
No.

654
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,200
Lucifer hasn't been around

655
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,560
in Halan for long.

656
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
If you say you haven't used it,

657
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,560
how do you know all this?

658
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
Did someone teach you?

659
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,240
They...

660
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,160
They gave us special training.

661
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,360
They?

662
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,000
Mr. Ma, right?

663
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,360
How do you know Mr. Ma?

664
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,560
Officer,

665
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,360
I've never even seen those people.

666
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,480
I only contacted them over the phone.

667
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,680
I tried calling them back later,

668
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,320
but no one answered.

669
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
So, as you said,

670
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,760
you've never met your supplier.

671
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,160
How did you pick up

672
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
the goods?

673
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
Just through phone contact.

674
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
They'd tell me the time and place,

675
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,000
and I'd go pick it up at night

676
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
and leave the money there.

677
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,000
I heard that's how most people do it.

678
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,880
And after you received the goods,

679
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,320
how did you sell them to buyers?

680
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,440
Describe it in detail.

681
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,500
Yes.

682
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,000
Sometimes, I'd hide it in a dog collar.

683
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,840
The whole thing takes just a minute.

684
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,440
No need to talk.

685
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,200
Other times,

686
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
it's hidden in a couplet.

687
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
And some people

688
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,800
hide the money in a milk delivery box.

689
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,160
[Mengbin Dairy]
Every household has it.

690
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Nobody gives it a second look.

691
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,800
Sometimes, it's done in hotels.

692
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,080
I delivered right to the room door

693
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,120
and got money through the door gap.

694
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,840
People doing this way

695
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,840
are usually with status.

696
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,160
They would use it in hotels

697
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,240
and would clean up before going home

698
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,040
without anyone noticing.

699
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,640
That's pretty much how it works.

700
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,800
I've told you everything I know.

701
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,000
These drug dealers
are acting like they're in a spy movie.

702
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
How do we even investigate this?

703
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,160
Most of them

704
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,080
have never even seen their buyers.

705
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,200
They don't know each other at all.

706
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
So we can only
catch the people listed here.

707
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,840
We have no trace of those

708
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,440
who haven't been named.

709
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,480
A transaction is done

710
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,960
within a few minutes or even seconds.

711
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,800
They break the SIM card
after every call.

712
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
They're really putting in the money.

713
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,080
It's pretty strange, isn't it?

714
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,760
People now are buying drugs
using mobile phones.

715
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,720
Is mobile phones so popular now?

716
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,440
That's one of the
unique aspects of meth.

717
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,840
Ecstasy is relatively cheap

718
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,880
and is sold mostly in dance halls,

719
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,080
karaoke bars, and small pubs.

720
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
Buyers tend to use it in groups.

721
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
But meth is different.

722
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,080
Meth is usually used alone

723
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,240
in a more private space.

724
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
And Lucifer is quite expensive.

725
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
People who can afford it

726
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,160
are mostly wealthy

727
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,960
and have social status.

728
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,040
Indeed.

729
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,920
Among the buyers that Siliang mentioned,

730
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,800
almost none of them were short of money.

731
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,240
Aside from bosses and factory directors,

732
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,040
there were even
some highly educated people.

733
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,840
Highly educated?

734
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,040
I don't understand.

735
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,320
How can people with so much education

736
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,080
still take drugs?

737
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,720
What are they thinking?

738
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,120
That's the scariest thing about drugs.

739
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,040
No matter how high your education
or awareness is,

740
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
once you get involved with drugs,

741
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,680
your life is over.

742
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,760
You lose your humanity.

743
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,200
Not to mention knowledge and culture.

744
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,320
And imagine how much pain

745
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,600
their families must be going through.

746
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,840
There are many other victims

747
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,960
like Grandpa and Grandma Sun.

748
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,080
They did nothing wrong,

749
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
but because of those
drug users and dealers,

750
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
they lost their lives.

751
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,520
Look at you.

752
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,320
Pull yourself together.

753
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,480
No matter how hard it is,

754
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,200
we've got to get to
the bottom of Lucifer.

755
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,200
What are police for?

756
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
It's about dealing
with these bastards, right?

757
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,200
So what Mr. Ma

758
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,080
is powerful?

759
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,400
You got to do something?

760
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,320
Understood.

761
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,560
Police!

762
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,520
Guozhu?

763
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,240
What are you doing here?

764
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,760
Uncle,

765
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,720
I'm training myself to be brave.

766
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
Then you should go to the morgue

767
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,080
instead of the kitchen.

768
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,120
What's wrong with you, kid?

769
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm getting old,

770
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,440
and I can't take this.

771
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,680
You nearly scared me to death.

772
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,680
I think I can handle it.

773
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,000
What's the matter?

774
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm not as scared anymore, Uncle.

775
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,760
You brat.

776
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,920
Alright now.

777
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,800
You're a big guy.

778
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Don't act foolish.

779
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,680
Alright.

780
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,120
Oh my god, you really scared me.

781
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm sorry.

782
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,600
Sorry, sir.

783
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,480
I didn't see you.

784
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,640
Got it, boss.

785
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,840
Get lost.

786
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,180
[Thirty-three to 12 AM
Li Wenlong enters the KTV]

787
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,420
Come on, boss.

788
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,900
Come on.

789
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,620
Let me toast to you.

790
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,060
Come on.

791
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
You can really drink, Long.

792
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,700
- Cheers to brotherhood!

793
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,980
- Five leaders!

794
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,420
Drink.

795
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,620
Come on, another one.

796
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
- Five toasts!
- Eight horses.

797
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
