Dad, this is foreign wine.

[Twelve years ago]
Imported wine.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,320
It is quite expensive.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,200
But

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
don't worry now.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
You can drink as much as you like.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,640
We have plenty at home.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
From now on,
we won't drink the cheap stuff anymore.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,880
We'll only drink this.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,680
Alright?

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Dad, Mom,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,920
in the past, we were too poor.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,200
You both didn't live a good day

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,720
until the end.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,120
It was all because I was useless.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,640
But now, things have changed.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
We have money now.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,800
We have so many.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,360
You can spend freely.

Eat whatever you want.

22

Drink whatever you like.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,640
If you run out of money,

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,840
just tell me in my dream,

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,280

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,520
Yes, this is your grandson.

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,600
My son.

there's actually something
I haven't told you.

The year you passed away,

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
there was a big snowstorm.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
The snow was so heavy.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Our house collapsed.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,080
No one cared for me anymore.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,920
I had nowhere to go.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,040
So, I found a bridge to shelter under.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
I stayed there for the whole winter.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,120
I was frozen terribly.

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280

Today is a happy day.

At the back of the factory.

Hurry over.

No visible signs of struggle

The ladder is only half there.

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,960
He must have known he couldn't escape

Nothing.

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,860
Just some unregistered numbers.

93
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,660
He probably destroyed the SIM card
after each call.

The case is closed. Why go back?

103
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
I was thinking last night,

104
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,620
Qin Yi,

105
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,980
before his death,

106
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,580
burned a huge pile of things.

107
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,980
There's something off about that.

108
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,300
I spent all night
piecing together the ashes.

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,500
But it was burned so thoroughly.

110
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
I couldn't make anything out.

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,620
Don't be ridiculous.

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,220
What do you expect?

113
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,180
For him to leave you a puzzle
in the ashes?

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,340
I'm saying

115
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,020
his behavior itself is very abnormal,
right?

116
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,180
He was about to die,

117
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,220
taking his own life,

118
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,060
why bother burning those things?

119
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,500
He must've wanted to destroy evidence.

120
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,660
But we already have

121
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,900
the entire criminal chain
of the Red Dragon Group.

122
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Burning it was pointless, right?

123
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,940
That's the problem.

124
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,380
I'm worried

125
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,420
there might be some evidence
that we haven't found.

126
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,020
Some key clues.

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,260
Some crucial information.

128
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,940
So important that Qin Yi,
such a cunning guy,

129
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,300
even on his last breath,

130
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
wanted to destroy it.

131
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,380
But we've already pieced together

132
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,300
the entire criminal chain
of the Red Dragon Group.

133
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,180
Let him check.

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,980
It's his professional habit.

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,740
Every time a case is closed,
he goes back to the scene

136
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,460
to rummage through trash.

137
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,100
He can't help it.

138
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,420
Don't you need a beating every few days?

139
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,100
Bei!

140
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,540
Am I right?

141
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,100
I mean you're searching for evidence,

142
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,860
searching for gaps,

143
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,020
and striving for perfection.

144
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,980
You are my model, Bei.

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,260
Where are the keys?

146
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380

Hey.

148

By the way,
is the rope I left in the trunk

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,460

150
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,180
Yes.

151
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,580
What do you want to do?

152
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,580
See you around.

153
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,220
Do you think
going back to the crime scene

154
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,020
will uncover the truth?

155
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,100
This isn't suicide.

156
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,700
What?

157
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,740
Wasn't Qin Yi the only one up there
that night?

158
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,460
All our police forces
were focused on the front,

159
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,260
guarding the main gate.

160
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,420
The factory didn't have a back door.

161
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,220
The ladder was only halfway fixed,

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,020
meant to mislead us into thinking

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,180
that no one could escape that way.

164
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,340
But look at this wall.

165
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,900
After descending halfway on the ladder,

166
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,780
he can take the way to this side.

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,580
Looking from this construction,

168
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,420
anyone can easily climb down.

169
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,940
So, that day,

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,180
he didn't plan to commit suicide.

171
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,460
He wanted to escape.

172
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,700
Who would want to die
if they could live?

173
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,340
Look around.

174
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,180
There's a railway here.

175
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,340
And these are all abandoned factories.

176
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
If he had really gotten in there,

177
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,380
it would've been hard to find him
in the midnight.

178
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,020
Well,

179
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,420
then how did he die?

180
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,380
Accident?

181
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,300
He slipped?

182
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,940
Get the rope.

183
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,140
Let's go up and check.

184
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,660
Right here.

185
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Give me the rope.

186
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,340
Wait,

187
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,460
you're not planning to jump, are you?

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,420
Who's jumping?

189
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,580
You're going down directly.

190
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,260
Director Gao will scold me if he knows.

191
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,300
He won't if you don't let go
of the rope.

192
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
Mr. Gu's fingers moved.

193
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,980
Is he waking up?

194
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,780
What?

195
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,340
Did you imagine it?

196
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,860
He's breathing, so his chest moves.

197
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Of course, it moves.

198
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,340
I really saw it.

199
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,860
Fine.

200
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,180
Is he waking up?

201
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,140
Mr. Gu, can you hear me?

202
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,980
I'm the Police Beauty.

203
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,460
What?

204
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,340
Do you have a problem with that?

205
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Don't you think
I have a beautiful smile?

206
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,540
Yes. Very lovely.

207
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,380
I mean,

208
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,820
Mr. Gu is just unconscious,

209
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,060
not in a vegetative state.

210
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,540
You don't need to be so nervous.

211
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,620
Be careful.

212
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,820
Xiaoguang,

213
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,380
loosen the rope a bit.

214
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,300
I can't get down.

215
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,980
What?

216
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,340
Loosen the rope a bit.

217
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,900
You're pulling the rope too tight.
I can't get down.

218
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,100
Loosen it a bit.

219
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,060
Mr. Gu!

220
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,460
I told you.

221
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,700
Mr. Gu, how do you feel?

222
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,820
Are you okay?

223
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,460
Where is Zheng Bei?

224
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,340
Where is Qin Yi?

225
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,300
Dead.

226
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Dead?

227
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,540
No, he is not dead.

228
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,820
Zheng Bei isn't dead.

229
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Qin Yi is dead.

230
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,420
Zheng Bei was here

231
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,820
watching over you all night.

232
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,980
Now he's gone back to the crime scene.

233
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,900
Look at you.

234
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,820
Police Beauty,

235
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,820
your joke is too much.

236
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,860
I'm just happy to see you wake up.

237
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,460
You've been asleep for two days.

238
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,980
You slept from the arrest
to the case closure.

239
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,940
The case is closed?

240
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,660
We are going through some procedures,

241
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,540
but it's almost done.

242
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,180
Although Qin Yi committed suicide
out of guilt,

243
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,620
his evidence chain is complete.

244
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,420
At his factory,

245
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,180
we found some Red Dragon and meth.

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,980
You can rest assured now.

247
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
Hello?

248
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,820
This is good news.

249
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,180
We can finally take a break.

250
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,180
No.

251
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,340
No.

252
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,980
What's wrong?

253
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't move around.

254
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,540
What are you trying to do?

255
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,300
Phone.

256
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,500
Do you have a phone?

257
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,900
There's one in the nurse station
in the hallway.

258
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,060
You just woke up.

259
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,020
What's wrong?

260
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,900
[Nurse Station]
What happened?

261
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,780
What are you doing?

262
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,820
The drug lord behind Lucifer
isn't Qin Yi.

263
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,460
What?

264
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,220
Well,

265
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,460
then what about the batch of meth
that we seized earlier?

266
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,180
Qin Yi captured me to make Lucifer.

267
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,900
He didn't have the formula.

268
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
The products produced in that factory
are inferior.

269
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,420
Answer the phone.

270
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,340
Hello?

271
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,540
Hello, Zheng Bei,

272
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,420
the case can't be closed.

273
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,940
There's someone behind Qin Yi.

274
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,060
He didn't...

275
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,820
I know.

276
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Qin Yi didn't commit suicide.

277
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,860
He was silenced.

278
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,260
The ladder was shot through.

279
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,460
What's wrong, Yao?

280
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,740
You're scrubbing the blackboard so hard

281
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,180
you'll wear it down.

282
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,740
Thought the case was closed,

283
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,860
she was planning
to take her parents on a trip.

284
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,660
She even bought train tickets.

285
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,620
Now she has to cancel everything.

286
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,020
It's understandable.

287
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,780
Ran, why are you so calm?

288
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,340
What else can I do?

289
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,060
Well,

290
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,580
shouldn't you be more upset?

291
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,580
You could've gone home,

292
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
but now we're stuck here,

293
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,860
solving the case.

294
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,500
Xiaoguang,

295
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,220
you're right.

296
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,620
You're absolutely right.

297
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,300
You're being a bit perfunctory.

298
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,740
I feel like you never thought about
going back.

299
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
Back to where?

300
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,540
- Bei.
- Bei!

301
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,620
Did you find the sniper?

302
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,340
Wow, why are you so proactive today?

303
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,900
When am I not proactive?

304
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,580
What's wrong with her?

305
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,780
She's eager to catch the killer
and close the case.

306
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
So that
she won't have to refund her ticket.

307
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,460
Oh, I'm afraid I'll let you down.

308
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,220
I went to the building
opposite the factory.

309
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,980
The killer is quite professional.

310
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,780
Left no clues behind.

311
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,140
Alright, don't pull a long face.

312
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
Mr. Gu,

313
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,180
on behalf

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,500
of Special Investigation Team,
I present you with a gift

315
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,260
to honor your bravery and fearlessness

316
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,420
in this case.

317
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,140
Take a look.

318
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,580
What is it?

319
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,900
Just take a look.

320
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,380
Do you like it?

321
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,060
The four of us, plus Uncle,

322
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,980
each person a pair.

323
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,820
Then I must choose carefully.

324
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,220
Thanks, Bei.

325
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,140
I'll take this one.

326
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,660
What are you doing?

327
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,060
I mean I'm giving him the socks
on behalf of all of us.

328
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,060
Put it back.

329
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,940
These won't fit anyway.

330
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,940
Too small for me.

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,540
Here.

332
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,760
Look at the bottom of the socks.

333
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,960
You can step on villains.

334
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,480
Isn't that symbolic?

335
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
So festive.

336
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
Wear them often,

337
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,280
and those villains will be gone.

338
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,120
It's both a recognition of Ran's bravery

339
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,920
and a tribute to Ran's heroic sacrifice
with his socks.

340
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,560
Good!

341
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,920
When Guozhu was surveying the scene,

342
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
he said he found

343
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
sock fragments in the explosives.

344
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
I thought he was kidding.

345
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Those were all from the scene.

346
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,120
How could I joke about that?

347
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,840
But, honestly,

348
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,920
if the drug dealers saw this,

349
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
they'd be surprised.

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,720
Who'd have thought

351
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,920
the bomb had two flasks plugged
with socks?

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,080
Ran totally nails chemistry.

353
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,120
Okay.

354
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
You're interested in chemistry now?

355
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
How about we have a twenty-minute class?

356
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
- Meeting time.
- Come on, let the meeting begin.

357
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,800
Bei, weren't we about to have a meeting?

358
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Alright, be serious.

359
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Let's get started.

360
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,400
The sniper

361
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,840
left no clues.

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,280
What do we do?

363
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,760
Although Qin Yi's men are desperados,

364
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
most are just thugs, muscle for hire,

365
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,480
not trained in shooting.

366
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
So, this time, it's different.

367
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,560
Listen,

368
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
what we're facing now

369
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,840
aren't just hooligans anymore.

370
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,680
This group

371
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,880
is made up of criminals
with sophisticated logic.

372
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Previously,

373
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,880
we thought

374
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,640
Qin Yi was the source of the Lucifer,

375
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
believing he was Ma.

376
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,040
But after this,

377
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
it's clear Qin Yi wasn't.

378
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,360
He was just a mid-level operative

379
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
in the organization,

380
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
responsible for transportation
and sales.

381
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,000
He used the convenience of taxis

382
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
to sell ecstasy

383
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,280
and smuggled some meth.

384
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,560
So,

385
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,800
this so-called Mr. Ma,

386
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
isn't Qin Yi,

387
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,600
but his superior?

388
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Wait, are you summarizing for me?

389
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
Didn't I just say that?

390
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
Then Bei's earlier suspicion
makes sense.

391
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,760
Qin Yi didn't commit suicide.

392
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
He was trying to escape.

393
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,920
The things he burned before escaping

394
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
were probably evidence
directly linking him to his superior.

395
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,040
Right?

396
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,930
[Wanhuang Hotel]

397
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,450
Sir, they went up.

398
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,410
Dad, why are you pacing?

399
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,250
It's just two people.

400
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,530
No need to be so guarded.

401
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,330
Two people?

402
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,050
It looks like two.

403
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,730
But you don't know
how many are ambushed behind.

404
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,010
It's just a middle-aged woman.

405
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,050
Let me tell you,

406
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,050
even if Qin Yi came today,

407
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,450
I wouldn't be scared.

408
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,010
A middle-aged woman?

409
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,530
Listen,

410
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,090
even Qin Yi would be polite

411
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,250
and smile to this middle-aged woman.

412
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,930
Why's that?

413
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,490
Isn't Qin Yi pretty powerful?

414
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,530
Yes, very powerful.

415
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,050
That woman?

416
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,690
Jiang Xiaohai's sister?

417
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,570
Hurry, open the door.

418
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,570
In a minute.

419
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,090
Madam.

420
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,850
Mr. Long.

421
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,570
Dazi.

422
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,050
Long time no see.

423
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,130
Is this your son?

424
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,850
He's grown so much.

425
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,370
Hurry, greet your aunt.

426
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,810
Aunt?

427
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,850
Jiang Xiaohai calls her sister,
and I call her aunt?

428
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,610
Of course.

429
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,890
Do you want to be my brother?

430
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,130
Look at this young man.

431
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,090
You reminded me.

432
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,410
I heard you like to mess around
with my brother, huh?

433
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,450
Naughty.

434
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,290
I mess around with him?

435
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,250
Look,

436
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,810
he almost cracked my head open.

437
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,410
Alright.

438
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,290
Come here, Madam.

439
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,450
Have a seat.

440
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,250
Mr. Long.

441
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,050
Aunt, would you like something to drink?

442
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,770
Red wine?

443
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,090
Forget the drinks.

444
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,810
Is there anything to eat?

445
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,570
I haven't eaten yet.

446
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,250
You're asking the right person.

447
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,930
Our Western food is quite authentic.
I'll...

448
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,650
No.

449
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,290
I can never get used to that.

450
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,290
Do you have noodle soup?

451
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,930
Oh, no problem.

452
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,890
Go.

453
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,970
Tell the kitchen,
and don't forget to peel some tomatoes.

454
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,730
Okay.

455
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,650
Just wait a moment,

456
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,650
I'll go now.

457
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,890
Peel the tomatoes.

458
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,370
Hello.

459
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,410
Notify all security,

460
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,450
to be on alert.

461
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,970
Wait.

462
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,130
Bring me a bowl of noodle soup,

463
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,010
and use the kitchen's broth, quickly.

464
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,570
Long time no see.

465
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,530
To be honest,

466
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,610
I was planning

467
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,130
to visit you.

468
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,490
But instead,

469
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,330
you came over first. Look at me.

470
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,290
How could I let you come visit me?

471
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,530
Look at how big your hotel business
has grown.

472
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,690
I was really afraid

473
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,130
you wouldn't care about us
ordinary folks.

474
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,290
How could I?

475
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,890
Back then in 1983,

476
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,490
if it weren't for you and my brother

477
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
giving me a chance to earn a living,

478
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,410
how could I be where I am today?

479
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,210
I'll never forget that kindness.

480
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,610
I'm glad you remember.

481
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,010
I was worried you'd forget.

482
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,090
I won't.

483
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,490
So, take a guess,

484
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,370
what I'm here for today?

485
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,090
Regarding Qin Yi,

486
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,490
I admit I didn't handle it well.

487
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,530
I should have informed you in advance.

488
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,930
But fortunately,

489
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,730
the police didn't catch him.

490
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,770
They only got Erjin, right?

491
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,770
Besides, he was the one
who first caused trouble in my place.

492
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,370
If I hadn't dealt with it,

493
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,370
how would I do business?

494
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,090
Aunt,

495
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,170
here it is.

496
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,250
About this,

497
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,690
you really didn't handle it well.

498
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,170
Yes.

499
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,210
You couldn't even stop a stray dog,

500
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,810
and he nearly got away.

501
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,370
If he had really made it out of Halan,

502
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,050
it wouldn't have been easy to kill him.

503
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,490
I heard Qin Yi died in the suburbs
a few days ago.

504
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,610
That must be you...

505
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,890
Don't worry.

506
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,410
All the account books
have been dealt with.

507
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,810
The account books are gone,

508
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,330
but you're still there.

509
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,290
What? You don't trust me?

510
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,850
I trust you,

511
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,770
but you're already surrounded
by the police.

512
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,610
You are well-informed.

513
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,410
My men have blocked them
inside the building.

514
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,490
They can't catch me.

515
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,250
Once I get into the Linzi,

516
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,010
I'll drive away.

517
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,290
Absolutely foolproof.

518
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,810
You're surrounded,
and you still think you can get away?

519
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,330
Who says I can't?

520
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,290
I'll get away now.

521
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,970
This phone can't be used anymore.

522
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,930
Wait for my call.

523
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,400
Qin,

524
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,480
he was bold and ruthless,

525
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
but too greedy.

526
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
Is this chicken soup?

527
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,320
It's delicious.

528
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,920
Aunt, tissue.

529
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,320
Get out. Your father and I need to talk.

530
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,800
Mr. Lin, what's happening?

531
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,520
Did you check outside?

532
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,320
Yes.

533
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,040
I looked through the parking lot.

534
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
All clear.

535
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
Listen,

536
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
from now on, she's my aunt.

537
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
If they come again,

538
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,160
you have to serve them well.

539
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,040
Got it?

540
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
Act smart.

541
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes.

542
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,920
Go.

543
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm suddenly a bit scared.

544
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,280
What's wrong?

545
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,680
If Bei hadn't noticed that bullet hole,

546
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
and all the evidence was destroyed,

547
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
we would've believed Qin Yi was Ma,

548
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,520
and closed the case.

549
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,160
Wouldn't that mean

550
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,720
we'd never know

551
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,600
there was a bigger force behind Qin Yi?

552
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
Stop summarizing, alright?

553
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,000
Didn't she just say that?

554
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,120
Do you think we didn't get it?

555
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Yao, let me tell you,

556
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,560
what you said is impossible.

557
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,680
Why?

558
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,080
These drug dealers

559
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
make meth to make money.

560
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,160
Eventually, they have to move the goods.

561
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,280
And it's not just drug dealers,

562
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,280
all kinds of criminals,

563
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,040
once they commit a crime,

564
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,800
they'll inevitably leave traces

565
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,120
and clues behind..

566
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,560
And we're the ones

567
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,080
who find those traces.

568
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,560
We can't let them get away.

569
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,600
Besides, Qin Yi was too obvious.

570
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,360
The meth seized from his factory,

571
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,800
once tested,

572
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,720
would be found to be inferior,
and semi-finished products,

573
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,880
completely different from Lucifer,

574
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
which circulates in the market.

575
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,600
So we would definitely realize

576
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
there were people behind the scenes
who we hadn't caught.

577
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,880
Qin Yi's subordinates also confessed

578
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
that he had been making drugs
for a while,

579
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,480
but could never find a good cook
to make it.

580
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
So, the meth he made

581
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,560
was always substandard.

582
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,360
But why did Qin Yi

583
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
try to make drugs himself?

584
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,680
Isn't that like openly competing
with his superior?

585
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
That's why he was silenced.

586
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,720
Well,

587
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,560
Ma probably knew

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
he was making drugs a long time ago,

589
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,840
and had been planning to kill him.

590
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,720
This just happened to be the right time.

591
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,560
Qin Yi's private meth production

592
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,560
was essentially overstepping his bounds
to make money,

593
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,320
severely infringing

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,680
on the interests of their higher-ups,

595
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
and even,

596
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
their dignity.

597
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,880
Besides,

598
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,000
it all started with Qin Yi's lackey,

599
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,640
that Song Wen,

600
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,680
hiding a bag of meth,

601
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,200
which caught the attention
of the city bureau,

602
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,800
leading to the formation
of Special Investigation Team

603
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
to investigate the matter.

604
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,480
Ma must have hated Qin Yi deeply.

605
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
So logically speaking,

606
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,120
the person who most wanted Qin Yi dead

607
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,560
was his boss,

608
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Mr. Ma.

609
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,640
Okay.

610
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,600
Now, with Qin Yi dead,

611
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,320
and our previous leads cut off,

612
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,280
we should start afresh

613
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,840
and figure out who Mr. Ma is.

614
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,840
Your chef here is quite impressive.

615
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,560
Tell me about it.

616
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
Have him come over later

617
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
to teach me.

618
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,480
So I can then cook it
for my husband and children.

619
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,560
No need for that.

620
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,360
If you want to eat,

621
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
I can have the chef come
to your house every day

622
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,480
to cook for you.

623
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,600
No need.

624
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,560
Today,

625
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,440
I finally got to eat this.

626
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,880
So now,

627
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
let's talk business.

628
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,760
Madam,

629
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
what business?

630
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,000
My business and your business

631
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
have nothing in common.

632
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,080
That's true for now,

633
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,520
but it doesn't have to be in the future.

634
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,520
I remember that in the past,

635
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,560
everyone called you "Million Carrier."

636
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,280
Because you earned millions

637
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,320
with your bare hands.

638
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,480
That was over a decade ago.

639
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,960
Why bring it up?

640
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,440
Back then,

641
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,840
the reason we were willing
to work with you

642
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,960
was because we saw the ambition in you.

643
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,720
Unlike Qin,

644
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
you weren't focused on small gains

645
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,600
but rather on seizing every opportunity
to make big money.

646
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm here today

647
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,400
to discuss a major deal with you.

648
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
Madam,

649
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,920
the fact

650
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,000
that I'm calling you Madam

651
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,920
shows that I truly remember
your kindness.

652
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,760
So, if you have any difficulties

653
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,600
or need my help,

654
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I won't hesitate.

655
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,000
But I can't get involved

656
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
with drugs.

657
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,880
Gone straight, have you?

658
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,640
Yes.

659
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,960
I'd be a fool if I rejected it.

660
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,120
But look at Qin Yi.

661
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,560
He hadn't been dealing drugs for long

662
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,280
before the police were onto him.

663
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Look at me.

664
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
This is a five-star hotel.

665
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
Too conspicuous.

666
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,240
I can't hide drugs here.

667
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,200
Who asked you to hide drugs?

668
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,560
Qin Yi was responsible
for transportation,

669
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
and now that he's gone,

670
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,160
I need you to take over.

671
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,960
That's even more impossible.

672
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,560
Well...

673
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
I don't have drivers

674
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,560
or a fleet of vehicles.

675
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,920
How can I handle transportation?

676
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,840
Take a look at this.

677
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,680
I really can't.

678
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,640
Just take a look first.

679

[Wanhuang Hotel will take 20%
of the profits, around 3.4 million]

680
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,680
I've told you all my plan.

Your hotel

682
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
will remain completely safe.

683
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
Madam,
these profits are just estimates, right?

684
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They would only be more.

685
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,040
Xiaohai!

686
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,160
Bei.

687
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
Are you just eating this?

688
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,640
Yes.

689
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
My sister made it.

690
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Try it.

691
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,280
It's very tasty.

692
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
Let me taste it.

693
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,160
Radish.

694
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,800
It's good.

695
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,240
I know.

696
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,720
Not bad.

697
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,560
I'll make some for you later.

698
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,200
Okay.

699
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,560
Why are you here, Bei?

700
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,720
I came to check on you.

701
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Xiaohai,

702
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
Qin Yi is dead.

703
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
I heard about it.

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,080
You...

705
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm fine, Bei.

706
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,080
I mean it.

707
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Honestly, ever since I found out
he was selling those things,

708
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,440
I knew this day would come.

709
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,520
It was just a matter of time.

710
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,240
Alright.

711
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,200
Do you want to eat some more?

712
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,480

715

No, thank you. Let's settle the bill.

716
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,000
How much?

717
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,760
Sir, this way.

718
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
There's a seat. You can sit here.

I didn't get enough.

Done.

What?

Don't be in a hurry.

I made this especially for Mr. Gu.

Mr. Gu should be the first to try it.

729
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,400
Mr. Gu, give it a try.

730

How is it?

It's great.

See? Mr. Gu says it's great.

- Enough, you've had plenty.
- Just a little.

I told him

753
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,120
to save me a piece.

754
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I can taste it.

755
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,120
This pig definitely wasn't fed
with just any old feed.

756
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,040
It's a black-haired pig, isn't it?

757
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,760
Yes, raised at home,

758
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,600
and fed with grains.

759
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,520
It's incredibly tasty.

760
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,200
Okay.

761
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,160
Mr. Gu, why are you eating so little?

762
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,680
Are you still not feeling well?

763
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,160
I don't have much of an appetite.

764
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,240
Mr. Gu seems a bit off.

765
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,880
Normally, you love eating
stewed pork with vermicelli.

766
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,920
You usually eat half a pot by yourself.

767
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,160
What's wrong?

768
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
Eat your noodles.

769
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,600
I get you, Mr. Gu.

770
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,600
You're upset
because the case isn't over yet

771
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,240
and you can't go on vacation, right?

772
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,880
Yes.

773
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Who is Mr. Ma?

774
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,560
We still have no clue.

775
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Well,

776
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,560
I've stayed at your place

777
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
for too long.

778
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,240
Maybe I should move out.

779
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,960
Just stay at my place. It's no trouble.

780
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,040
Why move out?

781
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,080
It's hard to find a place now.

782
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,280
It's the off-season, so it's easy.

783
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,880
Besides, I've already found one.

784
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
I can move in a couple of days.

785
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,480
You've already found a place?

786
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,560
Then, go ahead and move.

787
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,800
We'll all help you when you move.

788
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes, Ran,

789
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,200
you're so fast.

790
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,320
Let us know when you're moving,

791
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
and I'll help you carry your stuff.

792
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh wow, such enthusiasm.

793
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,240
Are you eager

794
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,720
for Mr. Gu to distance himself
from Zheng Nan?

795
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,920
Eat your noodles,

796
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,120
and stop talking nonsense.

797
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,960
It's all because of this Mr. Ma.

798
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,600
He's hiding so deep

799
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
that we can't even get a clue.

800
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,360
It's frustrating.

801
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,000
Yes, I'm getting anxious too.

802
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,520
Director Gao had already told me

803
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,640
that once this case is closed,

804
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,800
I could retire.

805
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,440
Uncle, you want to go on vacation too?

806
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,400
Of course.

807
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,040
I've already planned it.

808
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,120
Once I retire,
I'm heading straight to Sanya

809
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
to soak up some sun.

810
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,720
Uncle, don't say that.

811
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,280
You know in war movies,

812
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
whenever people says things like that,
something bad always happens.

813
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
You brat.

814
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,960
Beat him.

815
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,640
What are you talking about?

816
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,720
Watch your mouth.

817
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,440
I'm not working on the case
with you guys.

818
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,080
My job is to take care of you.

819
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,320
Can't you say something nice?

820
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm sorry.

821
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,160
Eat.

822
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Enjoy your meal.

823
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm full.

824
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm going for a walk

825
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,720
to help digest.

826
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,880
You're done eating?

827
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,040
You could sit for a bit after eating.

828
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm full.

829
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,840
You all take your time.

830
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,360
Well, if you're full, pay the bill.

831
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
What's wrong?

832
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,920
What's going on with him?

833
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,320
How should I know?

834
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,600
I'll go check on him.

835
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
You're done eating too?

836
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,640
These noodles at the bottom of the pot
are burnt.

837
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,400
It has a burnt taste.

838
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,520
You are so picky.

839
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,080
Delicious, Uncle.

840
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
It's really good, I love it.

841
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,600
The fire was indeed a bit too high.

842
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,240
Alright, you love it.

843
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Get another scoop. Come on.

844
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,800
You kids are great.

845
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,360
What's wrong, Gu?

846
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,200
I've always felt

847
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
that this Lucifer case is not so simple.

848
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,400
And now, I see that I was right.

849
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,840
You had a hunch

850
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,320
that there was someone behind Qin Yi?

851
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,920
You know about that case in 1993.

852
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,520
My father and I

853
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
analyzed the meth samples together.

854
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
The purity at that time

855
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,360
was very similar to Lucifer from Halan.

856
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,640
Moreover,
that case was particularly vicious,

857
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,440
involving
a large drug trafficking group,

858
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,360
ruthless actions,

859
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,080
and a massive scale.

860
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,440
Over the years,

861
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
those producing and trafficking meth

862
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
must have become even more cautious,

863
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
more professional.

864
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,080
The sniper this time

865
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
just confirmed my thoughts.

866
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,120
From what you're saying,

867
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,560
it sounds like you know these people.

868
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,000
How could I know them?

869
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
What are you thinking?

870
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,480
Are you homesick?

871
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,200
Feeling down?

872
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
You could have gone home by now.

873
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,680
There's no one left at home.

874
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,480
What's the point of going back?

875
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,880
What are you talking about?

876
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,840
Bei, call from Xiong.

877
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,120
What's up, Xiong?

878
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,720
Alright.

879
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
Do they have a lead?

880
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,160
They have another homicide.

881
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,600
Let's go.

882
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,120
Bei.

883
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,440
What's the situation?

884
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,400
The victim is still unconscious,
and undergoing emergency treatment.

885
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
What about the perpetrator?

886
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,160
The perpetrator suffered a concussion

887
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
and is also unconscious.

888
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
So what's the situation here?

889
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,360
Drugged driving.

890
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
It happened early this morning.

891
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,600
Yes!

892
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,560
How is it?

893
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
People! Brake!

894
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,000
They were so high on drugs

895
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
that they mistook the accelerator
for the brake and floored it.

896
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,840
The old lady dodged,

897
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,640
but the old man didn't.

898
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,880
He was hit and thrown several meters.

899
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,390
When the traffic polices arrived,

900
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,790
they found no skid marks,

901
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,670
thinking it was intentional.

902
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,870
So they called me over.

903
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,830
And when I arrived,

904
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,550
well,

905
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,750
a whole truckload of drugs.

906
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,110
Is everyone on the car injured?

907
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,750
Only the driver was injured.

908
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,790
The other four barely had a scratch.

909
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,870
We've got them in custody
for interrogation.

910
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,110
What's this?

911
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,430
Meth.

912
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,990
Yes.

913
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,910
There's more

914
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,910
in the car.

915
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,310
I noticed

916
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,830
it looked a lot like
the stuff you've been investigating.

917
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,950
That's why I called you over right away.

918
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,790
This looks like Lucifer,

919
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,710
but whether it actually is or not,

920
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,190
we'll need to take it back for testing.

921
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,550
Did you get anything
out of the interrogation?

922
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,550
Nothing useful.

923
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,110
Their brains are fried from the drugs.

924
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,430
We did get one piece of information
though.

925
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,350
These drugs were purchased

926
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,910
on Monday night.

927
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,430
- Monday?
- Monday night?

928
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,590
On Monday,
we were still searching for Qin Yi.

929
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,190
We were all over the place
trying to track Qin Yi down,

930
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,750
and they had the nerve
to sell drugs in the open.

931
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,070
That's outrageous.

932
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,790
This Mr. Ma

933
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,230
must have been confident
that we had no leads,

934
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,310
so he acted with impunity.

935
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,150
If this is Lucifer,

936
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,630
it suggests they've changed
their drug trafficking methods,

937
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,870
