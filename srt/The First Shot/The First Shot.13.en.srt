00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,220
Ming's death will be in vain.

192
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,380
We have to calm down.

193
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,260
Wu.

194
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,260
Ling.

195
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,140
School is over?

196
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,060
Yes. I came to work.

197
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,620
Good girl.

198
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,180
Have you finished your homework?

199
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,340
Two cups of herbal tea.

200
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,540
Come on.

201
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,860
Think about it.

202
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,060
Hao was bold enough to do it so quickly.

203
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,260
He must have figured out how to escape.

204
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,940
We're running out of time.

205
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,900
What should we do?

206
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,780
Go get the photos developed tomorrow.

207
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,860
- Get the photos developed.
- OK.

208
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,420
I'll drop by tomorrow to do it.

209
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Our case is going pretty well.

210
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
What's going on?

211
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,900
What happened?

212
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,660
I got a message

213
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,220
that the Huazhou police will close
the net next week

214
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,620
and wipe out all
of Hao's drug networks,

215
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
including Red Dragon.

216
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,620
What?

217
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,340
Qin Yi bought drugs from Hao.

218
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,620
Will he be caught too?

219
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,580
We have to cooperate fully
with the Huazhou police

220
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,460
to close the net at the same time

221
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,660
and arrest Qin Yi.

222
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,540
Why?

223
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,540
We managed to find out
through small pushers

224
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,740
that the big pushers
unpacked goods and sold drugs

225
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
in hotels and inns.

226
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,420
We just got the evidence.

227
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,140
We can't close the net now, Bei.

228
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,340
Bei.

229
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,180
We've figured out Qin Yi's ecstasy.

230
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,340
But what about meth?

231
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,500
We still have no idea about it.

232
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
How can we close the net?

233
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,700
Isn't the Huazhou police too hasty?

234
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,060
Why should we cooperate with them?

235
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,580
Why can't they cooperate with us?

236
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,780
Besides,

237
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,980
we gave them the clues about Red Dragon.

238
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,140
Yes. Why should we?

239
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,460
Calm down.

240
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,380
The Huazhou police are
under great pressure.

241
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
They've been spying

242
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,580
on Hao for three years.

243
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,540
Five criminal police officers
died because of this.

244
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,220
They are sad.

245
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,660
They just figured out
Hao's drug networks,

246
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,460
and Hao is about to escape abroad.

247
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,300
If they miss this last deal,

248
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,540
the drug dealers, the money involved,
and the goods

249
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,940
will all be gone.

250
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,620
Huazhou is close to the border.

251
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,860
There are many ways to escape.

252
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,420
And the drug dealers there are rampant.

253
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,660
They hate the police.

254
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,900
Police die every year.

255
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,060
Their sacrifices won't be in vain.

256
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,500
We will fully cooperate.

257
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,380
What about meth?

258
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,380
Director Gao discussed it with them.

259
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,540
After Qin Yi is arrested,

260
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,700
he won't be taken to Huazhou.

261
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,820
He will be kept here for interrogation.

262
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,420
Qin Yi has many men.

263
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,740
We'll find out the origins of the meth

264
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,180
from him or Erjin.

265
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,020
Don't pull long faces.

266
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,100
Cheer up.

267
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,460
We're an elite team.

268
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,500
We can't be defeated
by such a little difficulty.

269
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,380
Officer Wu sent a message.

270
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,180
We know when the next batch
of Red Dragon will arrive in Halan

271
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,500
and who the traders will be.

272
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,220
They can't take buses.

273
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,580
So they will come by train again.

274
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,220
Time is terribly short.

275
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,980
We have no time to be dejected.

276
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,820
Get yourselves together.

277
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,340
Get moving.

278
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,380
Come on.

279
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,060
Got it.

280
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,580
Go for it.

281
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,180
Okay.

284
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,380
Ran, hurry up!

285
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,140
Let's go, Ran.

286
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,620
Go.

287
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,140
Quick.

289

What's the rush?

290
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,060
Mr. Gu, come out and take a look.

291
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,500
Come on.

292
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,580
What's going on?

See for yourself.

We're waiting for you.

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,280
Come on!

296
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,360
Come on!

297
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,580
Alright.

298
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,340

Go home early today.

301
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,340
Have a good rest.

302
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,820
Let's do it quickly today, okay?

303
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,340
Okay.

304
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,060
Alright.

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,820
they had a fight every year.

308
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,260
Mad Dog Yao always loses,

309
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,620
but she never gives up.

310
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,900
This is already a regular show here.

311
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,220
She listens to Bei, doesn't she?

312
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,020
Why are they fighting?

313
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,180
That's a long story.

314
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,100
Their relationship began

315
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,780
a long, long time ago.

Pick them up.

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,900
Let go.

321
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,940
You're not dumb.

322
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,940
Then why didn't you

323
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,340
hang out with us?

the pickles in her lunchbox?

327
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
- Right.
- Poor?

328
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,780
I can help you.

329
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,420
Well, write homework for me.

332
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,220
Say yes.

333
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Say yes.

335
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860

336
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,220
Good job.

337
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
Later,

338
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,160
the boys in her class all avoided her,

339
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,960
especially the boy who bullied her.

340
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,520
Well done!

341
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Great!

342
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
I think that guy

343
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
liked her.

344
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Silly little boys are all like that.

345
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
They bully who they like.

346
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
When hooligans molest women,

347
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
they also say this.

348
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,360
Nothing else you want to ask?

349
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
You said it was about her relationship
with Bei.

350
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,880
So what about Bei?

351
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm telling a story.
I have to make it vivid.

352
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,920
It's a foreshadowing, understand?

353
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,920
Don't move!

354
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Or I'll kill you.

355
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Give me the money.

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,280
Boss.

357
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,240
Are you okay?

358
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
Get lost.

359
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
Guys, go get him!

360
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,160
You little punk,

361
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,560
which gang are you from?

362
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Shut up.

363
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
The sentence for robbery

364
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
is at least three years.

365
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Meet me at the public security bureau
when you get out.

366
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,920
You hear me?

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,760
Cop.

368
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,680
He's a cop. Let's run!

369
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,920
Are you okay?

370
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Yes.

371
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,000
Are you alright?

372
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes.

373
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,120
So handsome.

374
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,360
Sir.

375
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,840
Can you give us an address?

376
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,320
We want to write you a letter.

377
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
Write me a letter?

378
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
Just send it
to the public security bureau.

379
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,880

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,740
Okay.

570
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,340
Get down.

571
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,300
Alright.

572
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,060
Be gentle.

573
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,220
The police and the people are united.

574
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,460
You guys are just in time.

575
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,860
This kid is too rampant.

576
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,820
He held a gun.

577
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,460
Is that so?

578
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:18,980
Yes.

579
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,540
Are you Lin Zhida,
the owner of Wanhuang Hotel?

580
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,580
Yes.

581
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,580
Nice to meet you.

582
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,660
Nice to meet you too.

583
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,180
What are you doing?

584
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,980
Cuff him!

585
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:30,700
Got it!

586
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,060
Why?

587
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,260
You said we were united, didn't you?

588
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,060
Go to the station and cooperate
with the investigation.

589
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,380
Behave!

590
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,820
Officer Zhang, are you alright?

591
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,180
Yes.

592
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Take him away.

593
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,260
Handcuffs.

594
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,260
Get up!

595
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,100
There is a gun on the ground.

596
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,580
Go.

597
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,620
Qin Yi.

598
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,420
