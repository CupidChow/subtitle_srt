5
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,060
Dad,

6
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,980
you're making food for yourself.

7
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Go away.

8
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,260
You've eaten.

9
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,420
Your mother and I are still hungry.

10
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,980
Where is the owner?

11
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,220
What's up with your cooking?

12
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,100
Ignore him.

13
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,620
I'll go take a look.

14
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
Just another drunk.

15
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,060
Ignore him.

16
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,060
Take your parents.
Get out through the back door.

17
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,140
Call the police.

18
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,860
Run!

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,700
Go, go.

20
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,340
Smash the restaurant.

21
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,860
Smash the restaurant.

22
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,700
Got it.

23
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,380
Burn it.

24
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,500
Where is the gun?

25
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Where is the gun?

26
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Where is the gun?

27
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,220
Gun.

28
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,540
Gun.

29
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,420
Gun.

30
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,820
Gun.

31
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,820
Gun.

32
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,140
Gun.

33
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,900
Liuzi, where is the gun?

34
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Don't move.

35
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,020
Listen, Shen Li.

36
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,140
Just come at me.

37
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,620
Leave my parents out of it.

38
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,780
Shen Li.

39
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,860
You remember me.

40
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,340
I don't just remember you.

41
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,340
I also remember your partner Zhang Xuan.

42
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,740
You two killed a cop.

43
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
Kill him.

44
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,220
Police. Don't move!

45
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,020
Don't move!

46
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,380
Don't move!

47
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,100
Are you okay?

48
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,740
Are you okay?

49
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,140
Are you okay?

50
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,980
Take it easy.

51
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,740
Get up!

52
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,620
Cuff them.

53
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,420
Cuff them all.

54
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,780
Bei, are you alright?

55
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,540
Cuff them all.

56
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,020
Bei,

57
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,300
check on Mr. Gu.

58
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,660
I heard his neck was blistered.

59
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,940
He's fine.

60
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,060
It's just a scratch.

61
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,700
Fine?

62
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,580
- Just a scratch?
- Without him,

63
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,260
this place would be a wreck.

64
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,020
You're ungrateful.

65
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm ungrateful?

66
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,580
Don't use Red Flower Oil.

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,780
It will make the swelling worse.

68
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,900
Who said that?

69
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
I've used it since childhood.

70
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,220
Trust me,

71
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,140
I get injuries all the time.

72
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,460
Mom, where is my ice water?

73
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:18,940
Here it is.

74
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,980
Here you are.

75
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,140
Here.

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,660
What are you doing?

77
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,220
Use this to ice it down.

78
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,260
It'll help with the swelling.

79
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,140
It feels good, right?

80
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,860
It's cold.

81
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,820
You'll be fine once the swelling's down.

82
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,180
Let me take care of you first.

83
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,900
Mr. Gu is a tough guy.

84
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,260
If I fuss over him,

85
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,420
he might get embarrassed.

86
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,540
Sounds like you'd be embarrassed.

87
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,620
I'm tough too.

88
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,820
But I don't mind a little pampering.

89
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,780
Alright, after I

90
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,500
take care of you,

91
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,300
I'll go check on him.

92
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,820
Son,

93
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,060
you're in your thirties.

94
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,500
Why are you still acting like a kid?

95
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm only thirty,

96
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,540
for crying out loud.

97
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,980
Mom,

98
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
close the restaurant

99
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,620
for a few days.

100
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,180
I'll get a decoration team tomorrow

101
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,580
to repair it.

102
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,740
Fu and the others are
going to Tieling for a trip.

103
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,860
You two should join them.

104
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,220
Your mom and I met in Tieling.

105
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,820
Take a trip somewhere,

106
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,140
maybe Shenyang.

107
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,500
Come on.

108
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Go rest.

109
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,780
I'll handle it.

110
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,580
I've got it.

111
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,060
Hold on.

112
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
It's too cold,

113
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,260
frozen solid.

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,340
Give it a second.

115
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,540
It's okay, son.

116
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,780
We can take care of ourselves.

117
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,460
This was just bad luck,

118
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,780
not your fault.

119
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,260
Mom,

120
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,740
that guy was someone I locked up.

121
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,540
He's out for revenge now.

122
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,180
And there are plenty more like him

123
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,860
in No. 5 Prison.

124
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,300
What if they're all like him?

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,660
How can I not worry?

126
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm a cop,

127
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,420
arresting bad guys all day,

128
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,620
but I can't even protect my own family.

129
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,220
Come on.

130
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,700
What about the people

131
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,380
who've turned their lives around
because of you?

132
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,780
They still come by to support us.

133
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,580
Right, Dad?

134
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,780
And all those banners we've got.

135
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,540
The garage is almost full.

136
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,340
Yes.

137
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,060
You're

138
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,140
the youngest detective captain.

139
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,100
You catch so many bad guys every year.

140
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,220
I go dance in the park

141
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,460
with my head held high.

142
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,020
The other old guys are jealous.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,300
Aren't you doing Tai Chi?

144
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,740
It's a mix of Tai Chi

145
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,940
and square dancing.

146
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,300
It's a new style.

147
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,660
Alright, go inside.

148
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,460
All this talking

149
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,740
is stressing me out.

150
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,460
Go back to your room.

151
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,260
So it's a new dance.

152
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,060
Tai Chi dance.

153
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,380
Fine, I'm going.

154
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,580
I'll take care of Gu.

155
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,940
Eat it while it's hot.

156
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,060
Gu loves it.

157
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Make sure he gets plenty.

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,500
Keep icing Dad's dad's hand, okay?

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,940
Don't worry, I got it.

160
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,860
Mom,

161
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,460
don't worry.

162
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,620
What are you doing?

163
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,540
Mr. Gu's hurt pretty bad.

164
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,060
I'm going to help him bandage up.

165
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,140
Bandage?

166
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,180
Get out of here.

167
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,260
You can't even wrap dumplings.

168
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,540
Well, I've got a mirror over there

169
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,500
I need to get.

170
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,740
You want to get a mirror at this hour?

171
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,820
Can't you do it tomorrow?

172
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,140
What are you up to?

173
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,060
What is that in your hand?

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,140
Bei.

175
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,900
Is everything fine?

176
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,100
You finally came.

177
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,060
Where were you earlier?

178
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,340
I went to check the cabs.

179
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,260
I just came back.

180
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,980
Are your parents okay?

181
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,700
They're fine.

182
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,940
How about...?

183
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,020
She's fine too.

184
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,380
Don't worry. Go to bed.

185
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,500
Alright.

186
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,820
Bei.

187
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,900
Who is that guy?

188
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,980
He's pretty wild.

189
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,460
Three years ago, we busted him
for running drugs on a motorcycle.

190
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,060
He wasn't the main guy,

191
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,020
so they let him out.

192
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,420
Officer Liang was killed by them.

193
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,540
Eat it and go home.

194
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,700
Those punks.

195
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,580
We'll deal with them soon enough.

196
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,780
Go ahead.

197
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,660
You too, get some rest.

198
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,220
What are you doing?

199
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,060
It's not even in the right place.

200
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,340
Who did this for you?

201
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,420
Let me fix it.

202
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,100
No, really, it's fine.

203
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,820
Let me help you.

204
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,620
No need.

205
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,940
Seriously, you missed the wound.

206
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,780
Let me fix it. Come on.

207
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,660
Not embarrassed now, huh?

208
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,900
You got sharp ears.

209
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,660
I can hear everything

210
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,580
your sister listens to
through the walls.

211
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,660
I keep telling her to wear headphones,

212
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,860
but she won't listen.

213
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,380
Have some sweets to calm your nerves.

214
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,140
Thank you so much, Ran.

215
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,180
Aren't you a bit old
for White Rabbit candy?

216
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,260
My sister gave me this.

217
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,740
She said you're clever.

218
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,660
Apparently, it can be used
as a secret code.

219
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,660
See? Class actually paid off.

220
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,980
It did, it did.

221
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,260
You still skipping tomorrow?

222
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Eat something

223
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,940
before it gets cold.

224
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,980
Come on.

225
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,700
Son,

226
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,420
you're in your thirties.

227
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,900
Time to grow up.

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,020
I beg you pardon?

229
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,900
What did you just call me?

230
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,300
Are you eating or not?

231
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,860
Try some

232
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,860
fried dumplings.

233
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,500
Come on.

234
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,540
Let me take a look.

235
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,020
Let me take a look.

236
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,380
Morning, Uncle.

237
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,100
Gu.

238
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,060
Why did you

239
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,300
run to work?

240
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,580
Feeling better?

241
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Almost back to normal.

242
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,300
Morning, Uncle.

243
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,940
Morning.

244
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,980
Had to run,

245
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,100
or I'd still be half-asleep.

246
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,260
Your Halan accent is getting better.

247
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,140
Alright, I'm heading inside.

248
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,060
Go ahead.

249
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,220
Wang.

250
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
Take care. Rest up.

251
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,460
Healing takes time.

252
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,340
Okay.

253
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,540
Officer Zheng.

254
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,860
What's with you?
Spending money like it's nothing?

255
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,900
Everyone earns their money
through hard work.

256
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,860
You know that.

257
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,660
Look at Gu.

258
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,300
He hasn't recovered yet,

259
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,460
but he ran to work.

260
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,860
You know that.

261
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,780
Enjoying

262
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,860
a cozy taxi ride?

263
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm investigating taxis, Uncle.

264
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,060
- I'm leaving.
- Hold on.

265
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,660
What now?

266
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,500
What are you doing?

267
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,780
You're acting like

268
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,820
one of them now, huh?

269
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,980
Not calling me Master anymore?

270
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,820
Come on. Let go.

271
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,260
We were just talking.

272
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,420
Why are you getting physical?

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,300
You're investigating taxis

274
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,660
so you had one pulled over
right at the police station.

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,500
Are you informing the criminals?

276
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,660
Who's the fool here,

277
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,700
you or them?

278
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,780
Well...

279
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,180
It's to scare them off.

280
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,140
We...

281
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,180
I have a meeting.

282
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,420
You're too careless.

283
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,340
So many taxi fare receipts.

284
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
When will I be reimbursed?

285
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,060
Stop it.

286
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,660
Do you want to run to work?

287
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,580
- Director Gao.
- Director Gao.

288
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,980
Sit down.

289
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Director Gao, I'll start.

290
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,260
Go ahead.

291
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,220
We've looked into

292
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,740
all the taxi companies in Halan.

293
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,420
[Yifeng Taxi Company]
The focus is this company.

294
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,900
We were right.

295
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
These drug dealers

296
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,020
are indeed using cabs to run drugs.

297
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,860
This person

298
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,820
is the manager at Rattlesnake Cabaret

299
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
and is also

300
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,500
the second-in-command of Yifeng.

301
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,620
Erjin.

302
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,180
We've got the whole structure

303
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,500
of Yifeng figured out now.

304
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,060
Their drivers

305
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,300
caused a scene at the Wanhuang Hotel,

306
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,420
and I happened to be there.

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,780
I noticed something.

308
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,180
Only Yifeng's cabs

309
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,660
have in-car radios.

310
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,060
Those radios aren't cheap.

311
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,820
I checked.

312
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,420
If they're just using them for dispatch,

313
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,820
the cost is too high.

314
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,820
Mr. Gu.

315
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,300
Over the past couple of weeks,

316
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,580
we've confirmed one more thing.

317
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,460
Only this taxi company's cars

318
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,260
have traces of drugs.

319
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,540
Traces of drugs?

320
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,180
Yes.

321
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,700
Mr. Gu

322
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,660
summarized the scents of all the drugs.

323
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,460
He has taught us

324
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,700
to identify the scents
of different drugs.

325
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,180
We've even had several classes on it.

326
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,900
That's a useful technique.

327
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,100
We use it for investigation.

328
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,860
It helps us keep our investigation

329
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,180
under the radar.

330
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,460
Drug dealers are cunning,

331
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,940
and they usually hide well.

332
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,980
But no matter how careful they are,

333
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,900
once they're around drugs,

334
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,140
they leave behind a scent.

335
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,540
So it comes down to

336
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,580
"observe, smell, question, and pulse."

337
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,420
Have we tracked down their supply point?

338
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,460
Not yet.

339
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,260
But we suspect

340
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,260
of an abandoned factory
called Sanlianer Factory.

341
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,940
We've been waiting,

342
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,100
worried about tipping them off.

343
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,780
We're still in the surveillance stage.

344
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,780
They're only dealing ecstasy?

345
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,540
Yes.

346
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,340
You've investigated for so long.

347
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,940
Any progress on the meth front?

348
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,100
Not yet.

349
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,740
Even though Halan is far from the south,

350
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,740
the long northern

351
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,820
and eastern borders

352
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,940
make the situation complicated.

353
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,020
Drug activity has become more complex
in recent years.

354
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,060
Now, we've found new drugs.

355
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,620
The provincial authorities

356
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,340
are taking it very seriously

357
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,900
and have ordered us

358
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,500
to crack the case of new drugs

359
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,220
within three months,

360
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,860
before it spreads.

361
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
You guys have to be thorough

362
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,220
and precise.

363
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,500
Understood!

364
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:17,840
[Qin Yi]

365
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,140
Business is not about money

366
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,980
when it grows to a point.

367
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,180
Mr. Hu.

368
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,780
How many goods did Blue Aurora
steal from me?

369
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,700
I... I gave you all your money back.

370
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,340
Do me a favor.

371
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,700
Even your own dog

372
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,220
might bite you.

373
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,660
Your place is now mine.

374
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,580
Take it, take it.

375
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,740
I told you

376
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,420
not to be a thief.

377
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,860
Did you forget, or just not listen?

378
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,300
Boss.

379
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,540
Why's the goods
been moving so slowly lately?

380
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,420
Lately,

381
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,660
some of our guys

382
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,740
have noticed suspicious people

383
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,700
tailing our cars

384
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,300
and hanging around the warehouse.

385
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,700
We've had to

386
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,260
stop unloading a few times.

387
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,220
Shut him up.

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,820
The cops are onto us?

389
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
And this time,

390
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,300
they're targeting us specifically.

391
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,740
Who's running the task force?

392
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
They set it up after
what happened in White Building.

393
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,820
The leader

394
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,260
is Zheng Bei from Major Crimes.

395
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
Don't stress

396
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,860
about the taxis.

397
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,340
Just keep tabs

398
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,180
on Zheng Bei.

399
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,780
Boss,

400
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,340
if we can't move the product,

401
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,940
shouldn't we be more worried
about the taxis?

402
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Alright.

403
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,660
Boss, go enjoy a bath.

404
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,740
This mess is filthy.

405
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,780
I'll clean it up.

406
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,340
After that,

407
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,500
head over to Blue Aurora.

408
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,220
You'll be in charge there from now on.

409
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,380
Boss,

410
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,260
Xiaohai's getting out today.

411
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,180
Should we send someone to pick him up?

412
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,700
No need.

413
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,900
What should we do with this?

414
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,660
Grab a saw.

415
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,000
[Halan Detention Center]

416
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
Bei.

417
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300
Mao.

418
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,620
Officer Zheng.

419
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,780
Are you here to pick up Xiaohai?

420
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,820
Yes, yes.

421
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,660
I didn't want to leave Mao alone,

422
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,900
so I brought her along.

423
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,980
You... You here to see Xiaohai too?

424
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,380
Yeah, just checking on him.

425
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,100
Did he get into trouble again?

426
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,820
No, just visiting.

427
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,540
That's good.

428
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,420
I was worried he might've
caused trouble again.

429
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
He used to get into a lot of it?

430
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,100
No, not really.

431
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,140
He's just got a temper.

432
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,660
Was a bit impulsive as a kid,

433
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,940
but he's much better now.

434
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,420
What happened to him

435
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,300
as a kid?

436
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,300
Before he came to our house,

437
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,820
he went through a lot.

438
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,460
Before your house?

439
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,980
Isn't he your brother?

440
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,260
Xiaohai probably didn't tell you.

441
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,500
He's not my biological brother.

442
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,820
My real brother was also
named Jiang Xiaohai.

443
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,500
My dad didn't like girls much,

444
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,020
so he never treated me well.

445
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,420
Later,

446
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,580
my mom gave birth to a boy.

447
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,100
However, my brother

448
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
got sick and died in elementary school.

449
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,540
After that, my dad adopted a boy,

450
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,900
who you now know as Jiang Xiaohai,

451
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,300
and gave him my brother's name.

452
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,540
It was his way of coping.

453
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,540
I didn't know that.

454
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,660
But you two seem really close.

455
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,700
To my dad,

456
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,980
he might've just been a replacement.

457
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,100
But to me,

458
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,100
he's like my real brother.

459
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,980
I can see that.

460
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,980
We have

461
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,900
been through a lot together.

462
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,540
The first couple of years
after he came to our house,

463
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,180
things were good,

464
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,340
especially with my mom around.

465
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,820
But after she died,

466
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
my dad started drinking

467
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,980
and beating us both.

468
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,500
Eventually, I left for work down south.

469
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,900
I heard he nearly

470
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,260
got beaten to death by my dad

471
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,460
and ran away from home.

472
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,500
He has

473
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,580
had a tough life.

474
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,740
He's gone through a lot

475
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,700
and made many wrong choices.

476
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,660
I've always felt guilty.

477
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,500
I've been thinking

478
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,820
that if I hadn't left,

479
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,060
maybe he wouldn't be like this.

480
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,460
Bei's here.

481
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,060
Mao, go wait in the car.

482
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,980
I'll be right there.

483
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
Let's not hang around here.

484
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,580
How about coming to my place for dinner?

485
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,260
Yeah.

486
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Thanks, but I'll pass.

487
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,220
I just need to talk to Xiaohai.

488
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,460
I have to head back to work.

489
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,300
OK. You guys chat.

490
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,060
How was it in there?

491
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,620
It was... alright.

492
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,020
I've had time to think.

493
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,860
I talked to your sister.

494
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,260
She's been through a lot.

495
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,220
Stop getting into trouble.

496
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,860
If you can turn things around,

497
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,420
you'll be doing the right thing.

498
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,540
And don't feel like
you're less than anyone else

499
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,580
because you're not.

500
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
Stay on the right path.

501
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,180
But if you mess up again,

502
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,460
I'll bring you in myself.

503
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,100
Can you promise?

504
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,020
Yes, Bei.

505
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,980

506
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,380
Can we go home and eat?

507
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,260
Hungry already?

508
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,980
Quiet, Mao.

509
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,140
Alright.

510
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,340

511
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,260
go back now.

513
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,860
catch up later.

Go ahead.

515

Okay.

516
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,940
I'm going back, Bei.

517
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,100
OK, I'm leaving.

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,460
Last night,

526
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,380
these two foreigners were doing meth

527
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,420
at Blue Aurora.

528
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,060
Around 3 AM,

529
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
they hit up Xiangbali Bathhouse.

530
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,340
High out of their minds,

531
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,220
they started a fight with the staff.

532
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,140
One of them

533
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,060
stabbed his buddy to death.

534
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
The guy's totally out of his mind.

535
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,780
He's cooked his brain with drugs.

and statement.

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,220
Then we...

540
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,860
The results are out.

541
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,340

Positive.

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,980
We finally found our link.

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,660
It's at Blue Aurora.

548
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,340
They were on drugs,

549
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,380
but we can't

550
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,380
pin it on Blue Aurora just yet.

551
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,700

558

you two cover the lobby,

and handle the outside.

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,660
Got it.

576
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,380
Boss.

577
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,460
Over here.

578
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,300
Over here.

579
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,420
That table up front.

580
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,300
Check, please.

581
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,060
Right here.

582
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,780
Let me introduce you.

583
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,980
This is Lin Jiang,
the owner of Wanhuang.

584
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,820
This is the boss I mentioned.

585
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,580
Good to meet you, Mr. Lin.

586
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,260
We're all family here.

587
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,300
I'm Lin too.

588
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,500
Just call me Linzi.

589
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,620
Why don't we go somewhere else?

590
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,980
Let's go to my hotel.

591
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,660
What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

592
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,060
Not fancy enough for you here?

593
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,580
Come on, buddy.

594
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,940
You're running a big operation,

595
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,700
but you're still down to earth.

596
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,060
Let's chat here.

597
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,380
Alright then,

598
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,740
the first round's on me.

599
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,100
Good to meet you, Mr. Lin.

600
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Where are you from, Mr. Lin?

601
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,300
Local.

602
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,860
I've been in Halan for a while,

603
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,460
but I've never heard of you.

604
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,460
Don't take it the wrong way.

605
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,460
I'm just blunt.

606
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm all over the country.

607
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,380
Born and raised here.

608
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,260
A hustler.

609
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,780
What?

610
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,260
Never mind.

611
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,100
Let's talk business.

612
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,580
You really got a hundred cars?

613
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,180
Yep,

614
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,100
as many as you need.

615
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,740
Jettas?

616
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,780
ou sure you can do 15% off?

617
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,580
No doubt.

618
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,740
But what do you need so many cars for?

619
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,260
What for?

620
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,140
For taxis, of course.

621
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,260
Alright. I can get the plates too.

622
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,940
Mr. Lin.

623
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,780
You're running a business like this

624
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,140
all over the country.

625
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,260
Aren't you worried about getting caught?

626
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,180
The frames are all modified.

627
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,260
If they find out,

628
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,580
I'll get you a new one.

629
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,580
You're the man.

630
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
Mr. Lin.

631
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,540
Meeting you today

632
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,740
made my day.

633
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,620
Lately,

634
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,380
it's been nothing but bad luck.

635
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,420
What happened?

636
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,460
Ran into a real pain.

637
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Let's not get into that.

638
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,500
All healed up, Mr. Lin?

639
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,100
Why are you everywhere?

640
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,740
Are you haunting me?

641
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,300
Halan is small.

642
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,260
We're bound to cross paths.

643
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,260
Right?

644
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,420
Jiang,

645
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,340
I'm in the middle of something.

646
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
If you want to eat,

647
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,300
do it somewhere else.

648
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,780
Talking car deals?

649
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,020
Talk to me.

650
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,140
Mr. Lin, I swear.

651
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
I didn't tell anyone.

652
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Linzi, done eating?

653
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,860
Yes.

654
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,940
Then get back to work.

655
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,900
Okay, Hai.

656
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
You played me.

657
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,780
Mr. Lin,

658
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,580
no discord, no concord.

659
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,940
Let's settle this with a drink.

660
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,140
Screw that!

661
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,820
You still haven't answered me.

662
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,020
Can we cooperate?

663
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,860
You really want to work together?

664
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Fine.

665
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,700
I'll show you
what real cooperation looks like.

666
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,980
You played me.

667
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,380
Get my gear!

668
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,780
Fight!

669
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,820
Hello.

670
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,620
I'll be right there.

671
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,020
I didn't fight.

672
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,980
Really.

673
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,580
I was the one who got hit, sir.

674
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,180
City police.

675
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,180
That's all I know.

676
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,660
Sun.

677
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,740
Mind if I ask a few questions?

678
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Sure.

679
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,300
Why are you here, Bei?

680
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,900
What did I tell you this afternoon?

681
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,380
You've only been out a few hours.

682
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,140
Already looking for trouble?

683
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,700
I didn't fight.

684
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,940
You didn't fight?

685
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,900
Then why is Lin Jiang

686
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,780
all messed up?

687
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,260
It wasn't me.

688
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,500
I just came to eat.

689
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,380
What a coincidence.

690
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,780
So you just

691
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,820
happened to see Lin Jiang get beat up?

692
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,900
Right?

693
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,300
I... I didn't touch him.

694
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,020
Jun.

695
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,380
Did he start it?

696
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
No.

697
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,980
He was just quietly eating his noodles.

698
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,260
How do you know each other?

699
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,840
[Mr. Zheng Great Chicken Ribs]

700
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,280
[Mr. Zheng Great Chicken Ribs]

701
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,940
Sorry, Uncle, Auntie.

702
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm really sorry.

703
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,740
Sorry, Miss Zheng.

704
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,380
No need to apologize to me.

705
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,620
Just know you were wrong.

706
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,140
Right, Dad?

707
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,420
Alright.

708
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,940
I heard

709
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,020
you didn't get into the fight.

710
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,300
But it's still my fault.

711
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,140
I shouldn't have gone there.

712
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,180
And I should've shut it down

713
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,700
when they were fighting.

714
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,300
Uncle Zheng,

715
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,540
have a smoke.

716
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,020
Bei.

717
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,620
Bei.

718
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,820
Xiaohai.

719
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,220
Xiaohai.

720
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,580
What's wrong?

721
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,820
What are you doing?

722
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,180
If you light up in here,

723
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Mom's going to call the cops.

724
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,820
Didn't you see the sign there?

725
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,020
No smoking inside.

726
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,840
Nobody gets a pass,

727
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
not even my director.

728
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,280
Sorry, Auntie Zheng.

729
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,320
I'll step outside and smoke.

730
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,280
Auntie, Uncle,

731
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,200
don't worry.

732
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,160
Tomorrow morning,

733
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,880
I'll get the place fixed up.

734
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,680
It'll look just like before.

735
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,280
Don't worry about it.

736
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,320
For two months,

737
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,360
it's been nothing
but fixing the main store,

738
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,760
then the branch.

739
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm worn out.

740
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,240
Here's just been done?

741
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,280
Don't worry about it.

742
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Go on with your work.

743
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,880
I'll chat with him.

744
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Let's go.

745
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,280
Eat something.

746
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,640
I just ate.

747
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Come on.

748
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,080
It's my treat.

749
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,480
What do you want to talk about?

750
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,320
Nothing heavy.

751
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,240
Just chit-chat.

752
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
I want to talk

753
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,240
about Qin Yi.

754
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
You know what business
Qin Yi runs, right?

755
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
Yeah, a taxi company

756
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,040
and a glass factory.

757
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,800
You know this.

758
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,480
Nothing more?

759
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,480
More?

760
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,760
At most some scuffles over business.

761
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,760
Nothing more.

762
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Someone died at his glass factory.

763
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
That's serious.

764
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,520
And that taxi company
isn't exactly clean either.

765
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Besides passengers,

766
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
what else are they hauling?

767
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,320
Bei,

768
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm just a security guard.

769
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,080
Whatever they haul

770
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,320
has nothing to do with me.

771
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,400
Maybe.

772
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
But that doesn't mean you don't know.

773
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,640
Right?

774
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,160
So, tell me,

775
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,920
how much do you know?

776
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,280
Bei, please don't ask.

777
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
I don't know anything.

778
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,080
Xiaohai.

779
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,600
I've seen a lot of guys

780
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
like you.

781
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,160
Young,

782
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,160
been through some stuff,

783
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
made mistakes,

784
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
but deep down, not bad.

785
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,960
When I see that,

786
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,600
I try to help.

787
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,160
Bei,

788
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,640
I know you care

789
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,280
and want to help.

790
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,640
I care because I'm a cop.

791
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,520
I don't want to see you go astray.

792
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
But that doesn't mean
you can fool the police.

793
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm not trying to fool anyone.

794
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
Those guys who jumped Lin Jiang,

795
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,960
they're from White Building, right?

796
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,880
I remember their faces.

797
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,600
You're playing the word game.

798
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
You didn't throw a punch.

799
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,640
But can you really say
you had nothing to do with it?

800
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,400
Are you here to arrest me?

801
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,440
I'm here to help you.

802
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,120
Since you know what Qin Yi's into,

803
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
you must realize

804
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,040
he's breaking the law.

805
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,400
I need your help

806
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,320
to take him down.

807
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,640
You want me to be your informant?

808
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,320
Betray my godfather?

809
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,760
That's the wrong word.

810
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,880
It's not betrayal.

811
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,280
It's doing the right thing.

812
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,520
I can't help you.

813
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,520
I've never touched
the stuff you're after.

814
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,320
Maybe not yet.

815
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
But can you guarantee
you won't in the future?

816
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,000
Can you be sure
Qin Yi won't force you into it?

817
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,320
Bei,

818
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,360
do you know how I met Qin Yi?

819
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,840
Tough boy.

820
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,520
Have another sip.

821
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,120
You're awake.

822
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,560
Where are your parents?

823
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,280
You're an orphan too.

824
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,240
Come with me.

825
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,920
I'll buy you new boots,

826
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
a hat,

827
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,280
a coat, and pants.

828
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,000
Okay?

829
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,880
You'll freeze if you stay here.

830
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,560
Can you get up?

831
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,520
If you can, come with me.

832
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,040
This winter is cold.

833
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,240
Much colder than the one I remember.

834
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,880
Meeting you under this bridge

835
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,240
must be fate.

836
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,160
Five years now.

837
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,080
I don't want to lie to you.

838
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,280
But I can tell you

839
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,840
that Qin Yi never involved me
in his dirty work.

840
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,040
I really don't know what he's up to.

841
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,920
If you've got evidence,

842
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,800
go arrest him.

843
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,920
That's all I can say.

844
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,000
I've given you a chance.

845
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Just kidding.

846
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,280
I get it.

847
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,520
You're close to him.

848
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,560
Let's eat.

849
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,760
Godfather.

850
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,400
You're here.

851
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,200
You startled me.

852
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,680
Where were you?

853
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Went by my sister's,

854
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,240
then took care of Lin Jiang.

855
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,680
Take a seat.

856
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,320
Godfather.

857
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,280
The cops are really watching your fleet.

858
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,680
You should be careful.

859
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,960
It's fine.

860
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,920
Let them check all they want.

861
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,040
You mean that officer, Zheng Bei?

862
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,400
Did you go get information for me,

863
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,400
Xiaohai.

864
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,200
Are you looking out for me,

865
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,120
or are you getting too close to him?

866
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,120
You think I don't notice?

867
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,680
Check equipment.

868
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,640
Confirm teams.

869
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,480
Get ready to move.

870
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,640
Roger that.
