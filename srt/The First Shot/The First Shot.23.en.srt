Exactly.

193

They were being so cautious

197
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,920
that it actually gave them away.

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,920

We can't hear what they're saying there.

376
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,680
When Xiong went
to check the fire safety last time,

377
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,080
we should've had him
plant a device in there, too.

378
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,720
The whole bureau

379
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,440
only has this one functioning recorder.

380
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,920
Be happy with what we have.

381
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,400
Xiong said

382
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
there was a back door in that room.

383
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
What if Bai Ling
slips out through that door?

384
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,360
Guozhu.

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,120
Yes?

386
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,520
Grab a walkie-talkie.
Go keep an eye on the back door.

387
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,240
Jiang Yingzi is out.

388
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,680
She doesn't have the bag?

389
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,760
No.

390
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,840
She's closing up already?

391
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,520
Guozhu, what's happening
at the back door?

392
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,320
Nothing.

393
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,400
Bai Ling's probably still inside.

394
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,360
Come in.

395
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,680
Uncle Liu.

396
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
Fei, what brings you here today?

397
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,840
I've come to see you.

398
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is around the corner,

399
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,400
so I bought a toy for my little nephew.

400
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,600
It's imported.

401
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,920
Oh, you shouldn't have.

402
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
Besides, your nephew is only four.

403
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,280
Can he even figure this toy out?

404
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
Just keep it, Uncle.

405
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
Alright. Have a seat.

406
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,360
I'll get you something to drink.

407
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
Would you like coffee or tea?

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,800
Coffee.

409
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,640
I'll make one myself.

410
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,840
How have you been lately?

411
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,240
I'm doing okay.

412
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,880
Thanks.

413
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,040
That's enough.

414
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,920
Uncle,

415
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,360
when can I go see my dad?

416
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
Well,

417
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,040
not for now.

418
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,160
Can't they make an exception?

419
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
Until the trial is over,

420
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,840
no one but his lawyer can see him.

421
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
That's the rule.

422
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,400
I can't do anything about it.

423
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,600
But if there's anything you want to say,

424
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,680
I can pass the message to him for you.

425
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,840
Uncle,

426
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
how much time will he get?

427
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,160
Come in.

428
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,840
Hi, Aunt Yingzi.

429
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,560
Madam.

430
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Fei, you're here too?

431
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,520
Have a seat.

432
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,280
No classes today?

433
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,280
What are you here for?

434
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,160
I've finished my classes for today.

435
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,120
You miss your dad, don't you?

436
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
I'm here today

437
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,200
to talk to your uncle
about your dad's situation.

438
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,160
We're all working on it.

439
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,280
Thanks, Aunt Yingzi.

440
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
Oh, no need to thank me.

441
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,480
We're family.

442
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I'll arrange for you

443
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,280
to take a trip

444
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,040
to Sanya for a little break.

445
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,640
Just leave your dad's case to me.

446
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,960
Auntie Yingzi,
I'd rather stay here in Halan.

447
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,840
That way, if anything happens to my dad,

448
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,080
I'll be able to hear about it
right away.

449
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,600
If something's bothering you,

450
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
feel free to talk to me.

451
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,160
Don't keep it all bottled up, okay?

452
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
If there is nothing else,
I'll get going.

453
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,800
Bye, Uncle.

454
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,960
Come over for dinner
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

455
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm heading to the karaoke
with my friends that day,

456
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,200
so I won't be coming over.

457
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,840
Alright.

458
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,880
- Bye.
- Drop by anytime you like.

459
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,880
Got it.

460
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,280
Fei,

461
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,920
do you have anything
you'd like me to pass on?

462
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,040
I'll be seeing your dad
in a couple of days.

463
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Not much.

464
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,080
Just tell him

465
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,520
to take good care of himself.

466
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,480
Okay.

467
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,000
Bye.

468
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
Jin Fei's getting anxious.

469
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,200
Have someone keep an eye on her.

470
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,520
Got it.

471
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
How has Erjin been behaving?

472
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,280
He's been keeping his mouth shut.

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
He knows what not to say.

475
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
I've looked into Wang's case.

476
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
It's settled.

477

Hello?

483
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,000
Bei,

484
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
she went to a law firm this morning,

485
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,480
watched her daughter's
piano performance in a competition,

486
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,760
and then took her to McDonald's

487
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
before heading home.

488
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,920
Then what happened?

489
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,480
Her lights are already out.

490
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,680
She's probably gone to bed.

491
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,080
I'll keep watching.

492
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,480

Alright.

I'll head over later.

Don't bother coming here.

502
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320

What's up, Bei?

506
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,960
You can head home now.

507
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,920
No need to stay here.

508
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,200

Sure.

Now that you mention it,
I'm getting hungry.

520
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,120
You're hungry?

521
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,640
Should I make
some instant noodles for you guys?

of the shift or the second half?

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,440
Yes or no?

562
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't forget who you are.

563
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,160
I just want to find my dad's body.

564
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,000
Why?

565
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,520
Why can't we bring
evil people to justice?

566
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,120
Who says we can't?

567
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
We'll find the evidence,

568
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,920
convict him,

569
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,720
and make him pay for what he's done.

570
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,000
That's how justice works.

571
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,960
Who is Li Wenlong?

572
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,560
He's a murderer,

573
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,680
a criminal, a thug!

574
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,320
Do you want to become like him?

575
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,720
But there's nothing we can do.

576
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
We have the law on our side.

577
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,760
Right.

578
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,240
The law is on our side.

579
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,920
The law is on our side.

580
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,920
Wash your face

581
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,600
and get some sleep.

582
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,760
I'll take over
for the rest of the night.

583
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
Bei, Bai Ling opened the door.

584
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,240
I saw a guy

585
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,880
walk around the pharmacy several times

586
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,920
before knocking on the door.

587
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,080
Are they a couple?

588
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,920
Looks like it.

589
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,600
It's too dark.

590
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,920
I can't see his face clearly.

591
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
Should I get closer and check him out?

592
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,800
No need.

593
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,040
That's Li Wenlong.

594
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,000
Don't startle him.

595
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,960
What? Li Wenlong?

596
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
Keep watching them.

597
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,120
I'll go to the back door

598
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,120
in case they run off.

599
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
You've really got some nerve,

600
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,600
making me wait this long.

601
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Playing hard to get, aren't you?

602
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,480
I had to circle around
the place a few times

603
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
before knocking on the door.

604
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,680
Yeah, right.
You just didn't want to see me.

605
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,480
Had that been the case,

606
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,200
would I have come here?

607
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,160
You're the one with the nerve,

608
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,480
telling me to meet here.

609
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,800
Didn't Madam tell you to mail me

610
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,960
the car keys?

611
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,440
What else could I do?

612
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,880
We haven't seen each other

613
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
since you got into trouble,

614
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,920
and once you get the car, you'll
have to leave the city right away.

615
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,840
Who knows

616
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,640
when we'll meet again?

617
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,560
Besides,

618
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,200
you've been through so much lately.

619
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,120
You've even lost weight.

620
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,280
I had to see you.

621
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Otherwise, I'd never stop
worrying about you.

622
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,960
I know you care about me,

623
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
but Madam made the right call.

624
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
The cops are onto me,

625
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,120
so I do need to leave
as soon as possible,

626
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,480
and on my way out, I'll be overseeing

627
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,000
the shipment on the 17th.

628
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,620
[Shipment on the 17th]

629
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,560
We've finally got the evidence
you've been looking for.

630
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
The connection between Jiang Yingzi,

631
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,960
Bai Ling, and Li Wenlong
is basically clear now.

632
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,040
None of them are getting away.

633
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,280
Come on. Let's go inside.

634
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Come on, go.

635
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
They went into the back room again.

636
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,080
But they left the door open.

637
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Sit down.

638
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Is the car clean?

639
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,760
Of course.

640
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,400
We've got all the paperwork done.

641
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
How much Lucifer

642
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
can we load this time?

643
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,400
Take a guess.

644
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,600
Once this job's done,

645
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,040
I'll buy you a diamond ring.

646
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,880
Really?

647
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,160
Really.

648
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,840
Guozhu,

649
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,000
you can get off work now.

650
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,920
Go home and get some sleep.

651
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,000
Roger.

652
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,880
Look,

653
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,600
justice is
on the good guys' side, right?

654
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,760
It's pretty clear now.

655
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,400
Li Wenlong is working for Jiang Yingzi,

656
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,880
and she's the head
of the drug trafficking group,

657
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
Mr. Ma.

658
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,840
Bai Ling

659
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,600
is a key player, too.

660
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,920
And a master of disguise.

661
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,880
That disco was likely

662
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,040
one of their major drug-dealing dens.

663
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,720
She pretended to be a cleaner

664
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,800
and made herself look all innocent.

665
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,480
Anyway, the important thing is,

666
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
they're about to make a move.

667
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,600
They're shipping the drugs on the 17th,

668
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,040
the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

669
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,440
And as soon as they make a move,

670
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
they're bound to slip up.

671
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,520
Exactly.

672
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,240
This time,

673
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,360
they're transporting the drugs
outside of Halan.

674
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,800
That means the market here

675
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,480
is no longer big enough for them.

676
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,120
They're looking to expand the market.

677
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
However, we have no idea

678
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,160
where their destination is.

679
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
It doesn't matter.

680
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,120
We already know the time

681
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
and have the targets to track.

682
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,680
They won't get away with it.

683
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,000
Looks like you're fired up now, huh?

684
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
Great.

685
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,720
That's the attitude we need

686
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,520
when dealing with criminals.

687
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,440
You're right.

688
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,240
If it weren't for you earlier,

689
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,840
I might've caused a disaster.

690
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,920
There's nothing wrong
with having a strong sense of justice.

691
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,520
You didn't start out as a detective,

692
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,640
so don't be too hard on yourself,

693
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,560
okay?

694
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,720
We can finally enjoy
a proper Mid-Autumn Festival.

695
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
You've never spent one
in the Northeast, right?

696
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,440
I'll show you

697
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,240
how we celebrate it here.

698
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,720
Is it any different?

699
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Way different.

700
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Alright then.

701
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,320
Get some sleep. I'll keep watch.

702
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,880
I can't sleep now.

703
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,760
Well, if you can't sleep,
you keep watch.

704
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,600
I'll catch some sleep.

705
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Sure.

706
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,080
What if they come out?

707
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
Let them go.

708
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,960
We'll round up the whole gang
after the Mid-Autumn Festival.
