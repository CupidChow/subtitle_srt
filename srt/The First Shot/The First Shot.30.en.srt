do you need a change of shoes?

You're going on the mission. You eat it.

There's a bomb on the door.

There's a tunnel.

to the Drug Processing Factory.

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
Knows what?

192
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
About Zhao Xiaoguang!

193
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Mrs. Zheng,

194
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,560
when's the wedding happening?

195
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,200
I think the Spring Festival
would be perfect.

196
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,160
No way.

197
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,480
It'd be too cold.

198
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I think the Waking of Insects
would be perfect.

199
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,680
Don't be ridiculous.

200
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,440
Mom...

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,400
The Waking of Insects is about bugs!

202
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,800
I say Grain Rain would be perfect!

203
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,640
You don't plan a wedding
based on solar terms.

204
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,400
- Then what is it based on?
- Base on the almanac.

205
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,120
The almanac, right?

206
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
You go by the almanac!

207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,160
This wind is insane!

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,960
Zheng Bei!

209
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,880
There's blood here!

210
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,000
Keep chasing.

211
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,200
You're finally here.

212
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,880
My family needs me. I'm leaving now.

213
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,600
Go ahead.

217
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,040
Got sand in my eyes.

218
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,280
What?

219
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,640
He's got sand in his eyes!

220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm fine. Let's go!

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,680
Bei!

222
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,480
Zheng Bei!

223
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,080
Bei!

224
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Zheng Bei!

225
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,080
Are you alright?

226
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,040
Are you okay?

227
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,520
Feeling a bit lightheaded.

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
What?

229
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,600
He's been pushing himself all day.

230
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,080
He probably has low blood sugar.

231
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
Got anything to eat?

232
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,600
Yeah.

233
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Here, Bei. One for each of us!

234
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,120
Give them all to him!

235
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,800
I'll take one.

236
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Here, Ran!

237
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,760
Here, Bei!

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
Nan gave these to you, didn't she?

239
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,120
Nothing gets past you!

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
How are you feeling now? Better?

241
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,320
Let's go!

242
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,040
Come on.

243
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,120
Let's go!

244
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
When we go back,

245
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,040
Uncle will get you some
sweet and sour pork

246
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
to replenish the sugar.

247
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,840
Why did Uncle come today?

248
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
To blow up the door.

249
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,560
He was worried

250
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
and insisted on doing it himself.

251
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,360
He almost blew us all up!

252
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,080
Liang Jiaju

253
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
tried to get us in the same place
and blow us all up.

254
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,080
What a heartless scumbag!

255
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
I blame Uncle, too.

256
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,560
We told him not to come,

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
but he insisted on coming!

258
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000

Got it!

00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,560
Xiaoguang!

278
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,920
Hang in there, man!

279
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,120
Xiaoguang, hang in there.

280
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,240
Stay with me, Xiaoguang!

281
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,960
Where's the car?

282
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,360
Where's the car?!

283
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,840
I'll tell you!

284
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
At the lumberyard, next to the cabin.

285
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Xiaoguang!

286
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,880
Xiaoguang! How is he?

287
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,520
The bullet went through his abdomen.

288
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,200
We need to get him to the hospital fast!

289
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,760
Xiaoguang!

290
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
Stay with us. Don't faint.

291
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,480
Xiaoguang!

292
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,200
We're getting you to the hospital soon!

293
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,920
Stay awake!

294
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,680
Go keep an eye on Liang Jiaju.

295
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,080
Get someone to take him away.

296
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,560
I'll take Xiaoguang to the hospital.

297
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200
Can you do it by yourself?

298
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
How far have we come?

299
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,840
About two kilometers.

300
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,600
Alright, I'll carry him.

301
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Be careful!

302
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Captain Wang,

303
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
we got him!

304
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Bei,

305
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,120
I have something to tell you.

306
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,720
It's about you and Nan, right?

307
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Don't worry.

308
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,480
I'll get everything taken care of
when we get back.

309
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
Just hang in there!

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,800
It's not that.

311
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160
Yao has a boyfriend now.

312
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
It's Wu Gang.

313
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,600
Stop worrying
about other people's business.

314
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Focus on yourself!

315
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
You'd better not

316
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,680
tell her I told you.

317
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,960
If you stay awake, I won't say a word.

318
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,520
Xiaoguang!

319
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,120
Come on, Uncle.

320
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,560
You guys go ahead.

321
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
Head back to the station
once you're done.

322
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
I'll cook something for you all.

323
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,880
Alright.

324
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,160
Xiaoguang.

325
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,640
Xiaoguang, leave.

326
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,360
Xiaoguang!

327
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,520
Xiaoguang!

328
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Run, Xiaoguang!

329
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,760
Stay back!

330
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,840
Stay back!

331
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,320
Bei!

332
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,320
Stay back!

333
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,940
- Bei!
- Stay away from me!

334
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,080
- Stay back!
- Zheng Bei!

335
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,460

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,640

337
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,120
- Bei!
- Zheng Bei!

338
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Bei!

339
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
Hurry, go pick up Gu Yiran!

340
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,560
- Bei!
- Zheng Bei!

341
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,320
You're awake.

342
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,040
Where's Xiaoguang?

343
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,760
Bei.

344
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,720
Where's Xiaoguang?

345
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,160
Bei, you can't get up!

346
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,880
Look at you.

347
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,320
Bei,

348
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
Bei, you...

349
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,880
You shouldn't go there for now.

350
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
Is he still alive?

351
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes.

352
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,440
But the doctor said

353
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,640
he might not be able to wake up.

354
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Bei.

355
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,960
Zheng Bei.

356
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,760
Bei.

357
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,400
Where's Xiaoguang?

358
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,160
He's inside.

359
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,960
Calm down.

360
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm fine.

361
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I just want to see him.

362
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,280
Bei...

363
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,240
Zheng Bei.

364
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,960
- You're still not fully recovered.
- Bei...

365
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,240
It's okay. I'll just take a look.

366
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:48,800
Enough.

367
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Zheng Bei.

368
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,600
Director Gao.

369
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,560
Director Gao.

370
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,720
You're injured.

371
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
You need to rest.

372
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Go back to your room.

373
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,640
Xiaoguang's made it through,

374
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
but he's still resting.

375
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,200
You should rest, too.

376
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm fine.

377
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,600
I was the one who brought him

378
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,480
on the mission.

379
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,200
I have to make sure he gets back safely.

380
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,200
Just let me see him for a moment.

381
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
He just got out of critical condition.

382
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,200
He suffered
from severe oxygen deprivation

383
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
and excessive blood loss.

384
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Even the doctors
don't know when he'll wake up.

385
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,160
Nan.

386
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,760
Bei, you're awake.

387
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Are you feeling better?

388
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
I'm fine.

389
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm here to check on Xiaoguang.

390
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,160
Bei, speak up.

391
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,920
Xiaoguang can hear you.

392
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,520
The doctor said

393
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
we should talk to him more.

394
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Familiar voices are more likely
to get his attention.

395
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,960
Right, Xiaoguang?

396
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Come on, you guys, talk to him.

397
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,960
Talk to him!

398
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,160
You... He likes you the best.

399
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,160
Please, talk to him.

400
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,280
You taught him that song,
and he sings it so...

401
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,920
So well.

402
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,160
I solemnly decided

403
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,080
to give my good luck to Ran.

404
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Xiaoguang,

405
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,680
I'll teach you a new song tomorrow.

406
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,560
It's really good,

407
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,080
but with your Cantonese,

408
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,200
it might be a bit difficult.

409
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,080
But I believe in you.

410
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,920
"Where there's a will,

411
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,560
there's a way."

412
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,600
Good thing you're just
teaching him a Cantonese song.

413
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,000
If you gave him a chemistry lesson,

414
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,680
we'd all doze off.

415
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
A chemistry lesson would be even better.

416
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,720
It'd wake him up for sure.

417
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Xiaoguang,

418
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,000
though Ran's not
giving you a chemistry lesson,

419
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm coming here every day
to recite chemical formulas to you.

420
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,960
It's alright. Don't worry.

421
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,480
Xiaoguang's a tough kid.

422
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,800
Starting tomorrow,

423
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,640
I'll come by every day
to give him a good scolding.

424
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,640
He'll wake up in two days.

425
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,360
Don't cry.

426
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
You can't do that.

427
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,800
You'll scare Xiaoguang even more.

428
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Stop making Nan more worried.

429
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Nan, why don't you

430
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,920
sing Xiaoguang a song?

431
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,480
Just sing "Mother in the Candlelight".

432
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,120
It's no secret.

433
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,360
We all know about it, right?

434
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,920
I've already informed
Xiaoguang's parents.

435
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,280
They'll be back tomorrow.

436
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
We'll take care

437
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,280
of all Xiaoguang's treatments.

438
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,560
Xiaoguang,

439
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,120
we're all here.

440
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
And the bad guys have all been caught.

441
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't worry.

442
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,720
It was all thanks to you today.

443
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,440
Without you,

444
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,280
we wouldn't have completed the mission.

445
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,200
Xiaoguang, you did great.

446
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm heading back
to interrogate them now.

447
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,600
You get some good rest here.

448
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Alright,

449
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
that's it for now.

450
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
I'm off.
