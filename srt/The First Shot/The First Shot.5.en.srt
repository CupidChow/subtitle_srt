00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,140
You were hurt.

195
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,700
This medicine is very useful.

196
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,660
Apply it to the wound every day.

197
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,780
It'll heal soon.

198
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,620
Well, we have rules.

199
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
We can't accept gifts.

200
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,060
Thank you.

201
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,820
My sister made it.

202
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,740
It's not worth much.

203
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,980
Just a small token of appreciation.

204
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,820
If you don't take it,

205
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,500
our whole family will feel really bad.

206
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,780
Alright, I'll take it.

207
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,060
Thank you.

208
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,140
Anything else?

209
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,900
My sister knows
you got injured saving Mao.

210
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,860
She feels really bad.

211
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,460
She'd like me to

212
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,940
invite you over for a meal at our place

213
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,180
so she can thank you in person.

214
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,180
This medicine's fine,

215
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,500
but I'll skip the dinner.

216
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,180
Officer Zheng, my sister is stubborn.

217
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,900
If you refuse,

218
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,580
she will come here herself.

219
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,580
How about this?

220
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,060
If you are busy today,

221
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,500
we can do it some other time.

222
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
Drop by anytime.

223
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,740
Why did you stop?

224
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Go on.

225
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,780
Don't wait for me.

226
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,100
I've got things to do.

227
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,100
I'll visit the victim's family.

228
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,540
They are very sincere.

229
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,620
I'll go take a look.

230
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,540
Jiang Xiaohai is suspicious.

231
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
I have to check it out.

232
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,340
Sit down.

233
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,580
I will go by myself.

234
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,540
Stay here and study hard.

235
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,140
No one can leave early. Do you hear me?

236
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,500
Alright, Mr. Gu.

237
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,220
Go on with your lesson.

238
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm leaving.

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
[Mixiang Hair Salon]

240
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,740
I see nothing wrong with your hair.

241
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,060
What's wrong with you?

242
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
What do you mean?

243
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,220
I said I wouldn't charge you
for the haircut,

244
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,420
but you're here too frequently.

245
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,100
Your hair is too short to cut.

246
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,740
If I shave your head,

247
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,380
you'll be bald.

248
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,740
Don't use a shaver.

249
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,740
Just use scissors.

250
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,020
Every time I look up,

251
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,780
it scrapes my neck uncomfortably.

252
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,540
Right here.

253
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,420
Okay.

254
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,380
Here.

255
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,500
As you wish.

256
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,460
Didn't Teacher Gu have classes for you

257
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,420
on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday evenings?

258
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,580
What's happening?

259
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,780
You took the lead to skip the class?

260
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,340
I had nothing to do with it.

261
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,700
Bei took the lead.

262
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,100
My mom bought you

263
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,740
the copyrighted tapes

264
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,780
of Four Kings and Richie Jen.

265
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,060
They will arrive next week.

266
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,940
Really?

267
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,980
Of course.

268
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,100
Thank your mom for me.

269
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,340
I'll give you the money
when I get paid next week.

270
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,500
Come on.

271
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,260
I had so many meals at your home.

272
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,420
Don't say that.

273
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,740
But your salary is low.

274
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,740
What?

275
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,100
This is overall management.

276
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,940
I save a lot of money every month.

277
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,700
Overall management.

278
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,140
Did you learn

279
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,540
that from Mr. Gu?

280
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,020
Don't mention him.

281
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
He's so annoying.

282
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,740
Okay.

283
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,540
I won't talk about him.

284
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,740
Look at you.

285
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,860
How are your parents doing in Shenzhen?

286
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,060
Pretty good.

287
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,140
They miss you very much.

288
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,020
Really?

289
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,140
Be careful with my ear.

290
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,180
How did the fuse blow again?

291
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,620
Uncle Zheng, can you
teach me how to fight?

292
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,100
Next time I see bad guys,

293
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,020
I can fight them.

294
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,700
Fighting is not okay.

295
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,100
Call the police if you're in trouble.

296
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,580
Don't fight them yourself.

297
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,620
Besides,

298
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,900
you can call me Bei.

299
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
No need for formalities.

300
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,340
Okay.

301
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,540
When I'm older,
I'll come to you for lessons.

302
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,460
No problem.

303
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,540
Officer Zheng,

304
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,740
thank you so much.

305
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,340
If something had happened to Mao,

306
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,580
I wouldn't be able to face my sister.

307
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,860
You saved both her

308
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,780
and me.

309
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,900
How about this?

310
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,620
I'll call you Bei too.

311
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Because she calls me that?

312
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,580
Fine.

313
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,460
As long as you don't mind.

314
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,140
Alright. I'll call you Bei then.

315
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,900
Okay.

316
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,660
Dinner is ready. Let's eat.

317
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
- OK.
- Come on, Bei.

318
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,420
Let's go eat.

319
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,220
Please sit here.

320
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,820
Thank you, Bei.

321
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,980
You're welcome.

322
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,940
That's my duty.

323
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,980
Officer Zheng,

324
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,300
I can't thank you enough.

325
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,860
If it weren't for you,

326
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,540
that knife would have

327
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,180
landed on Mao.

328
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,020
If something had happened to her,

329
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,060
I wouldn't be able

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,020
to live anymore.

331
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,020
I'm fine.

332
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,860
Don't scare yourself.

333
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,940
What a good kid.

334
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,940
It's okay.

335
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,340
Look at this big sausage.

336
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,100
I'll recover soon after eating it.

337
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,460
Oh, I'm making turtle soup.

338
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,100
Let me bring it over.

339
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,420
Xiaohai, look after him.
You guys eat.

340
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,220
More dishes?

341
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,980
What a feast.

342
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,460
Just eat.

343
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,580
Let's eat, Bei.

344
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,460
Okay.

345
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,460
I need light.

346
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,380
Come on.

347
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,700
The candle is burning out.

348
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,780
No wonder people like candlelit dinner.

349
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,780
You look so pretty

350
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,860
in candle light.

351
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,300
Like your long-lost ancestor?

352
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,140
Hurry up.

353
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,300
My brother could have fixed it
in a minute.

354
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Alright.

355
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,540
It's fixed.

356
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,220
Are you stupid?

357
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
I'll get you some medicine.

358
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,100
No.

359
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,420
I don't need it.

360
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,220
It doesn't hurt at all.

361
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,180
Well.

362
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,860
How about we turn off the light

363
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,420
and have a candlelit dinner?

364
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,140
I'll buy you sweet and sour pork.

365
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,060
Candlelit dinners are all about
fancy Western food.

366
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Who has sweet and sour pork?

367
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,420
Besides,

368
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,620
a romantic dinner

369
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,420
has to be eaten with Prince Charming.

370
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,820
You and I...

371
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,380
Why bother?

372
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,180
Let's go out and eat.

373
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,620
I want to eat pork kidney.

374
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,340
Well, look closely.

375
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,100
Do I not look like a prince
in candle light?

376
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,980
Look at me.

377
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,780
Taste this sausage.

378
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,980
Officer Zheng.

379
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,500
You're back.

380
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,580
Your brother-in-law?

381
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,380
Yes.

382
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,460
Nice to meet you.

383
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,140
Please sit down, Officer Zheng.

384
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,820
Officer Zheng.

385
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,100
Officer Zheng.

386
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,860
Thank you so much

387
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,900
for today.

388
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,540
That's my duty.

389
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,180
You're welcome.

390
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,420
I came to eat for free.

391
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,700
Don't say that.

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,100
If you like,

393
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,780
you can come at any time.

394
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,260
Take a seat.

395
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,220
Let's sit and chat.

396
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,660
Mao.

397
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,020
Your old roller skates broke.

398
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,380
I bought you new ones.

399
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,620
Do you like them?

400
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,580
Thanks.

401
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,420
Officer Zheng.

402
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm not very good

403
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,300
with words.

404
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,980
This is a small gift.

405
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,060
Please take it.

406
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
No, I can't.

407
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,060
We have rules.

408
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,300
I can't break the rules.

409
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Please keep it. I can't.

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,500
Bei is a police officer.

411
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,900
He didn't save Mao for this.

412
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,380
Don't make things difficult for him.

413
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,020
Sorry, I was thoughtless.

414
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,900
Well, Officer Zheng.

415
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,420
Let me know

416
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,420
if you need anything.

417
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,140
Yingzi runs a pharmacy.

418
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,860
Just let her know
if you need any supplements.

419
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,580
Okay.

420
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,100
No need to be polite.

421
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes. Come at any time.

422
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,780
Alright.

423
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,020
Don't mind me.

424
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Eat it, Bei.

425
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,420
Let's wait for him.

426
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,180
It's okay.

427
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Yingzi.

428
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,940
Look.

429
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,780
Your old one's almost gone.

430
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,860
The sales clerk said

431
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,740
this is the hottest color of the year.

432
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,220
It's too red.

433
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,260
It's for young girls.

434
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
It's okay. It suits you.

435
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980
They are so affectionate.

436
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,940
Yes.

437
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,820
They never brought me

438
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,580
on their family trips.

439
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,180
Are you speaking ill of me?

440
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,180
No.

441
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,500
Here is turtle soup.

442
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,340
The main dish arrived.

443
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,420
Officer Zheng.

444
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,500
Let me serve you some.

445
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,020
I can do it myself.

446
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,540
I'll help you.

447
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,260
Let me tell you.

448
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,260
The real deal in this soup
is the turtle's calipash.

449
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,900
They're fresh, tender,

450
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,180
and packed with nutrients.

451
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,140
Try it. Have more.

452
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,780
Okay, thanks.

453
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,500
Try some.

454
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,260
Come on.

455
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,540
Let me do it.

456
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,260
It's okay.

457
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,300
Yummy.

458
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,380
Does it taste good?

459
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:40,980
Yes.

460
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,940
Eat more.

461
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,620
Here you go.

462
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,180
This is yours.

463
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,460
Bei, you guys eat.

464
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,460
I'll make a call.

465
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,140
Okay.

466
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,100
Can you pass?

467
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,940
Yingzi.

468
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,020
Do you know some first aid

469
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,980
running a pharmacy?

470
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,060
Yes.

471
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,460
Sometimes our neighbor

472
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,300
had a headache, fever, or injuries,

473
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,740
he would ask me for help.

474
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,140
Xiaohai gave me the tobacco

475
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,940
to stop bleeding.

476
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,380
It's nice.

477
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,740
How does it work?

478
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,860
This brat

479
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,460
finally remembers something useful.

480
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,260
You don't know

481
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
how naughty he was as a kid.

482
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,140
He hurt himself every day.

483
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,060
At that time,

484
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,180
I used my dad's tobacco
to stop his bleeding.

485
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,940
It's a folk recipe for first aid.

486
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,500
Why don't you go home?

487
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,420
What are you doing?

488
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,660
I'm thinking of revising

489
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,140
tomorrow's lesson plan

490
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,100
to make it vivid

491
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,900
and engaging.

492
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,820
I'm having trouble understanding it.

493
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,260
What are you back for?

494
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,940
Just to grab a key.

495
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,740
Did you find anything

496
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,420
on your home visit?

497
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,860
At first, I was suspicious of Xiaohai.

498
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,860
He knows some street-smart tricks.

499
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,620
When I looked into it,

500
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,100
I found out...

501
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,740
his sister taught him
since he was little.

502
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,820
I thought too much.

503
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,420
A good police

504
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,940
keeps an eye on everything suspicious.

505
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,300
That makes sense.

506
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,780
Mr. Gu.

507
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,060
Let me ask you.

508
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,460
Your personality is

509
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,820
really something.

510
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,060
On the one hand,

511
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,460
you can be pretty sharp with your words.

512
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,820
On the other hand,

513
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
you take teasing from everyone

514
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,060
with a smile.

515
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,660
Xiaoguang and the others said

516
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,660
you gave them one class after another

517
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,860
to torture them.

518
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,740
However, you were making teaching plans

519
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,900
after work.

520
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,500
This is fun.

521
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,660
I came to Halan

522
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,900
to assist you guys.

523
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
This is my duty.

524
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,580
Mr. Gu.

525
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,060
Tell me.

526
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,900
Have you ever been upset

527
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,180
like other normal guys?

528
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,180
Time will tell.

529
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,020
Sooner or later,

530
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,500
the special investigation team
will accept me.

531
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,660
Wow, you're really on another level.

532
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,940
Can't get anything out of your mouth.

533
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,620
Mouse sent a message.

534
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,900
That guy

535
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,500
will sell drugs at a club today.

536
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,460
He didn't say what the guy looked like.

537
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,820
Be smart

538
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,660
when you observe the crowd.

539
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,380
If you find anyone suspicious,

540
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,500
lure them away from the crowd
before catching them.

541
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,940
Don't alert other people.

542
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,980
Got it.

543
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,020
Bei, are we not going
to catch the suspect?

544
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,820
Mr. Gu can't fight.

545
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,500
Why is he with us?

546
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,220
We act as a group.

547
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,980
Mr. Gu will follow us

548
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,300
in every operation.

549
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,220
Shall I make room for you?

550
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,140
No need. It's comfortable.

551
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,540
It looks nice.

552
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Go on.

553
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,700
Is it that guy?

554
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,940
How did they find out?

555
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,260
I don't know.

556
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,660
Hey.

557
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,140
Any red wine?

558
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,300
What?

559
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,220
Red wine.

560
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,260
Red wine...

561
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,980
No.

562
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,260
But I got something better
than red wine.

563
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,300
Want to try?

564
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,180
Mr. Gu is very skilled.

565
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Yes, he's so natural.

566
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,060
Better than you.

567
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,860
It's too crowded here.

568
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,060
Let's go to the back.

569
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,780
Hurry up.

570
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,860
You got the right person.

571
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,620
I have nice goods.

572
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,340
It's really good.

573
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,180
Red Dragon.

574
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,660
Do you have meth?

575
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,820
Meth.

576
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,940
Dude, that's too nice.

577
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,860
I don't have it.

578
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,140
But this is not bad.

579
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,940
Alright, I'll take them all.

580
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,060
All of them?

581
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,820
Yes.

582
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,860
What's going on?

583
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,340
Play dirty?

584
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,220
You two fight me and want to use a gun?

585
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,740
Forget it.

586
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,420
Who is she?

587
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,580
Listen.

588
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,140
Go away. I don't want to hurt you.

589
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,660
Ouch!

590
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,660
I've never heard
of anyone catching a suspect by sniffing.

591
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,260
Mr. Gu, are you a police dog?

592
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,460
How did you do it?

593
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,580
Every drug has its own unique smell.

594
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,980
If you hadn't skipped class yesterday,

595
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,940
you would have learned this.

596
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,540
I said

597
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,220
the meth class was pointless.

598
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,220
Today's bust was about MDMA.

599
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,900
You didn't plan it well.

600
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,140
What are you talking about?

601
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,980
Without Mr. Gu,

602
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,500
we wouldn't have caught the guy.

603
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,380
What are you thinking?

604
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,660
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

605
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,700
Mr. Gu.

606
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,940
Just sit over there,

607
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,980
across from me.

608
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,180
Don't work alone.

609
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,100
Hang out with us.

610
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,420
Sit here. We'll clean it up.

611
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,660
Yes. Move that box.

612
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,580
And wipe off all the dust.

613
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,300
Got it.

614
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,100
We have to study hard.

615
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
It's very useful.

616
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,260
I finally understand

617
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,860
the power of knowledge.

618
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,380
Even without knowledge,
you're full of strength.

619
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,980
When I arrived with Bei,

620
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,820
Biao saw us

621
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,260
as if he saw his family.

622
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,140
Mr. Gu was stunned.

623
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,420
Mr. Gu, you probably don't know this,

624
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,900
but Yao's nickname

625
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,900
in our police force is Mad Dog Yao.

626
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,580
She once went

627
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,020
to catch a rapist.

628
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,860
She was so angry

629
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,340
that she knocked
the innocent informant over.

630
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,780
Director Gao was exasperated.

631
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,780
Don't worry.

632
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,420
She never hit her teammates.

633
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,060
She's nice.

634
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,580
I did so many glorious things,

635
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,060
and you had to mention this.

636
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll beat you up.

637
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
Stand right there.

638
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,020
Yao,

639
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,740
you told me that.

640
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,180
You said she never hit teammates.

641
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,340
Well, it depends.

642
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,460
Yao,

643
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,620
stop it.

644
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,740
Get off me.

645
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,260
Do you admit defeat?

646
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,660
Yes.

647
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,460
Do you admit defeat?

648
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,020
My clothes.

649
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,740
Be gentle.

650
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,820
It's okay.

651
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,900
They're just playing.

652
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,340
Li Shengbiao, a local.

653
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,980
You've been in for fighting five times

654
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,620
and caught for drug use twice.

655
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,060
Alright. What happened today?

656
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,660
Nothing to say.

657
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,540
Who's your boss?

658
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,580
No boss.

659
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,740
So you made the drugs yourself?

660
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Good.

661
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,060
We caught a drug maker today.

662
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,860
Sir, you're interesting.

663
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,980
[Evidence: ecstasy
Case: drug dealing]

664
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,740
I didn't even go to school.

665
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,140
How can I make drugs?

666
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,900
You overestimated me.

667
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,660
Listen.

668
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,580
Just talk to us.

669
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,980
Don't waste my time.

670
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,140
Where did you get the necklace?

671
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,580
Ask the necklace.

672
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,980
Why did you ask me?

673
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,060
Have you been to Yuedong recently?

674
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,900
No.

675
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,100
This necklace brand is from Hong Kong.

676
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,540
It's hard to find on the mainland.

677
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,180
Most of them are sold
on the black market in Huazhou.

678
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,780
Your boss gave you this?

679
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,660
Sir.

680
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,060
I use my own money.

681
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,060
He said

682
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,460
they're sold in Huazhou.

683
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,220
I bought it.

684
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,060
It's just a necklace.

685
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,020
What does it have to with drugs?

686
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,260
Yes, I'm just guessing.

687
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,420
This necklace has a high gold content.

688
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,260
Gangsters and drug dealers love it.

689
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,180
Indeed.

690
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,540
Trading necklaces
doesn't make someone a drug dealer.

691
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,340
However...

692
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,380
We caught a murder suspect

693
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,500
a while back.

694
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,620
He is from Yuedong.

695
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
I have

696
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,420
his fingerprints.

697
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,420
If I found his fingerprints

698
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,740
on this necklace,

699
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,220
you'll be done for.

700
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,380
Accomplice to murder.

701
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,340
Let's go test it.

702
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,140
Don't waste time with him.

703
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,700
Wait, sir.

704
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Wait.

705
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,940
Murder?

706
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,020
Hey.

707
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,260
I don't know this guy was a murderer.

708
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,660
Who do you mean?

709
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,780
Liang and Biao agreed

710
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,780
to make a second deal

711
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
at Dongtie Market.

712
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,940
I've arranged for Mouse
to take Biao's place.

713
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,740
He'll be able to coordinate with us.

714
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,180
Just a gold necklace

715
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,140
carries so much information.

716
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,220
Mr. Gu, you're awesome.

717
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't want you to leave.

718
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,940
Mr. Gu won't go.

719
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,860
Really?

720
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,780
You quarreled with him,

721
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,220
didn't you?

722
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,900
Director Gao said

723
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,780
the Special Investigation Team

724
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,780
stays until the case is solved.

725
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,420
You guys should show concern

726
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,180
for Mr. Gu

727
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,660
and take care of him.

728
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,660
Study hard.

729
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,500
You hear that? Study hard.

730
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,460
Alright. I'll take good care of Mr. Gu.

731
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,620
Eat some rye bread.

732
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,140
No, thanks.

733
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,060
Song Wen

734
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,620
had meth with him.

735
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
Liang sold ecstasy.

736
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,340
Could he be the murderer
of the White Building case?

737
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,740
Very likely.

738
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,700
Why?

739
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,060
I got fingerprints

740
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
off the gold necklace.

741
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,100
Do you guys believe me?

742
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,340
With this rye bread again?

743
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,900
My office is full of magic tools.

744
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,300
I got three fingerprints.

745
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,460
One belongs to Liang.

746
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,060
It's the same as the one
on the drug bag.

747
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,620
Great.

748
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,540
We saw Guozhu's skills before.

749
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,660
No matter what he used, it works.

750
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,700
That's enough.

751
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,460
We finally made progress on this case.

752
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,220
You guys are all here.

753
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,980
Why are you here?

754
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,460
Xiong, take a seat.

755
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,700
Can I not just visit?

756
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,580
Want free dinner again?

757
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,820
I'm here for business.

758
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,700
You caught Xie Qicheng in Pattaya.

759
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,660
He confessed everything.

760
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,420
One of his guys happens to know

761
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,820
the Yuedong guy
you've been searching for.

762
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,980
Really?

763
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,500
Really?

764
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,380
The same person?

765
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,420
Yes.

766
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,980
This guy

767
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,180
is called Chen Liang.

768
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,660
People call him Liang.

769
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,940
He is just a delivery guy.

770
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,780
His drug trafficking gang

771
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,220
is separate from Xie Qicheng's crew.

772
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,100
They are enemies.

773
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,140
They always fought over the market.

774
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,060
Liang has a boss.

775
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,620
A big drug lord

776
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,060
called Hao in your hometown.

777
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,420
Yuedong police just sent us the photos.

778
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,700
I heard of Hao.

779
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,180
No one expected

780
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,020
he would sell drugs in Halan.

781
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,620
Okay, everyone, remember his face.

782
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,140
Set up surveillance within 200 meters

783
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,220
around the market.

784
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,620
Everyone goes undercover.

785
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,780
Xiaoguang and Mr. Gu,

786
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,580
you two play buyers.

787
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Just wander around there.

788
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,260
Guozhu.

789
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,140
There is

790
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,020
a small building there.

791
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,300
Get up there to keep an eye on them.

792
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,860
Stay in touch with us.

793
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,500
What about me?

794
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,820
You...

795
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,540
You play a couple with someone.

796
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,900
Who wants to team up with Yao?

797
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,220
Where are you going?

798
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,780
Ignore them.

799
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Who do you want to team up with?

800
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,380
Everyone, stay sharp.

801
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
Spread out.

802
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,460
Got it.

803
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,420
One bowl of noodles, please.

804
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:58,900
Okay.

805
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,820
Toss this for me.

806
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,540
Guozhu, how's it going?

807
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
No sign of the target yet.

808
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,100
OK, keep an eye on it.

809
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,540
Got it.

810
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,560
[Dongtie Market]

811
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,020
Target spotted, target spotted.

812
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,980
Where is he?

813
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,540
The east intersection.

814
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,540
Be careful.

815
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,580
I guess this guy has a gun.

816
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,460
Liang.

817
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,540
Biao sent me to pick up the goods.

818
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,540
Did he tell you this?

819
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm Mouse.

820
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,260
Get on.

821
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,660
Just stay here.

822
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Or you have to drive me back.

823
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,180
Too much trouble.

824
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,940
Did you bring the goods?

825
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,940
Here is the money.

826
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,220
Get on.

827
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,420
Get on.

828
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,180
Be careful.

829
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,380
Stop running!

830
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Stop!

831
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,860
Stop!

832
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,420
Stop running!

833
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,700
Stop!

834
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,500
Xiaoguang, are you okay?

835
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,460
Yes.

836
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,460
Mouse.

837
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,820
Mouse.

838
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,460
Bei?

839
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,540
Where are you injured?

840
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,980
I'm fine.

841
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,340
The target ran south.

842
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,500
There's a building blocking the view.

843
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,020
I can't see him.

844
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,900
To the south is Heping Road.

845
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,100
There's an intersection. See it?

846
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,620
No.

847
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,220
What's wrong?

848
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,340
I sprained my ankle.

849
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,340
Stay here and watch. Yao, follow me.

850
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,700
Guang.

851
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,860
We lost the target. What should we do?

852
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,740
Get in the car.

853
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,140
Heping Road.
Turn east at the intersection.

854
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Got it.

855
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,860
Get in.

856
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,140
Quick. Go straight and turn right.

857
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,580
Are you blind?

858
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,520
What's going on?

859
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,120
What is he doing?

860
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
What's happening?

861
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,660
Make way, please.

862
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
The cops are here. Laosi, quick.

863
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,940
Step back! We're police.

864
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,860
Step back!

865
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,980
Stop rubber-necking.

866
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,940
What's that?

867
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,020
