Exactly, why didn't you take him?

190
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,840
What's his background?

191
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
Spare us, please.

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Why didn't you take him?

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
Move. Head down.

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
You're really something,

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Mr. Gu.

196
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,720
Now, you think of me?

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Have a seat.

198
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,680
How does it feel to be caught here?

199
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Isn't it frustrating?

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
I really didn't do anything.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
I didn't say you did.

202
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm asking what you were doing here.

203
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
I was just tired

204
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
and came here to relax.

205
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,040
Staying up all night.
No wonder you're tired.

206
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,240
You're so careless.

207
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,800
You just got into trouble not long ago,

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
and now you get caught by our colleague.

209
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,680
Do you know
how many chicken ribs I had to

210
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,640
bribe Officer Liu

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,840
to get you out of this?

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
Don't you think
you owe me an explanation?

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
The chicken ribs are on me.

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Now, you're being generous.

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Is it about the chicken ribs?

216
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
What I mean is,

217
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
you're not familiar with the Northeast.

218
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,720
What if something happens?

219
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,600
Come to me if you need help.

220
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,520
I'll take care of it.

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm really fine.

222
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm doing okay.

223
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
It's really hard
to communicate with you.

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Gu Yiran,

225
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
do you even realize

226
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,520
how much you're bottling up inside?

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
Was the landlord who locked your place,

228
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
or did you lock it yourself?

229
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
A one-bedroom apartment?

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
Do you think we're silly?

231
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
Come on.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,520
You've probably
already rented that place.

233
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,320
Look.

234
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,160
By saying this,

235
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm not trying to interfere
with your private life.

236
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,200
I brought you from the South.

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm responsible for your safety,
understand?

238
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
You're a good big brother.

239
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,160
Do I need you to give me an award?

240
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,400
Fine, forget it.

241
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,120
Zheng Bei,

242
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,720
I really appreciate it, I do.

243
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,120
But I can handle

244
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
my personal issues.

245
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
Alright, I won't interfere anymore.

246
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,080
Handle them yourself if you can.

247
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,720
Zheng Bei,

248
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,920
please don't tell other team members
about this.

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,360
Embarrassed?

250
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,640
Don't worry. I won't.

251
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Thanks.

252
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,680
Bei, Ran,

253
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
what are you two doing here?

254
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,320
I brought Mr. Gu here
for some on-site learning

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,600
to see if we could find any

256
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,280
leads.

257
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
What are you doing here?

258
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,320
Officer Liu called me

259
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,400
and said the kid's mom...

260
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
Don't bring him here.

261
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,880
Well,

262
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,120
take this kid

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,760
to eat something,

264
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
and company him for a while.

265
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,120
His mom

266
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
might come late.

267
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,920
Alright.

268
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,720
Did you get your salary today?

269
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
Being so generous.

270
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,320
Go ahead.

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,960
Okay.

272
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,880
Why are you two

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,360
looking for leads here?

274
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,880
Why do you have so many questions?

275
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
Do I need to report to you?

276
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,400
No.

277
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,280
Hurry up and go eat.

278
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,960
Alright.

279
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,880
Bye, Bei.

280
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
Bye, Ran.

281
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Then I'll leave now.

282
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Where are you going?

283
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,800
I'll take you home.

284
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,840
No, go ahead and do your job.

285
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,760
What do you mean?

286
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,800
You got something else to do?

287
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Let's go.

288
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,080
No, really.

289
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Are you still arguing with me?

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,840
Fine, go ahead.

291
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
I'll spread the news.

292
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,600
Please don't.

293
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Okay?

294
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,600
Never mind. I'm busy too.

295
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
- I don't have time to deal with you.
- No, let's walk home.

296
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
- No, I'm not.
- Please, let's go.

297
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,600
Those cops are so annoying.

298
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
They're everywhere.

299
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Just drive.

[Two hours ago]

301
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,460
Boss.

302
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,180
Long, you're here.

303
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,300
Come on in.

304
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,220
Doing fine?

305
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,860
Yeah.

306
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,020
Come back next time.

307
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,700
Sure.

308
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,820
You're here.

309
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,420
Officer, I'm not.

310
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,420
Everyone who comes here says that.

311
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,660
Bei.

312
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,220
Look at this pouring rain.

313
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,380
Are you off work?

314
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,940
No, night shift tonight.

315
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,980
I'll head over soon.

316
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,700
My sister made some pickles.

317
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,060
So many.

318
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,620
Didn't you say they were good?

319
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,940
So when you're busy at work,

320
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,580
you can just eat these
with some steamed bun.

321
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,700
Alright, say thanks to your sister.

322
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,900
Mr. Gu,

323
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,780
you followed me for so long.
What do you want?

324
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,540
If it weren't for you,

325
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,660
I wouldn't have ended up in jail.

326
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,260
You had it coming.

327
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,780
Okay.

328
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,540
Then I'll show you
what "you had it coming" means.

329
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm off to work then.

330

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,980
try it.

340
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,380
That's not appropriate.

341
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,900
Try some.

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,060
you're not fatally injured.

378
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,380
What are you doing?

379
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,020
You want to get up?

380
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,460
You didn't tell my parents, did you?

381
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
You know,

382
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,180
we only share good news, not bad.

383
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,420
When you're fully recovered,

384
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,660
you can go home

385
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,340
and tell your parents yourself.

386
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,420
Okay.

387
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,260
What about Ran?

388
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,460
He's right here.

389
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,820
- I'm here.
- Ran.

390
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,060
How are you?

391
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,460
I'm okay.

392
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,180
Tough as nails.

393
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,220
Thank you for saving me.

394
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,060
Don't say that.

395
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,540
I can't just watch you get beaten up.

396
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm brave now.

397
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,220
But honestly,

398
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,340
that day,

399
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
if I hadn't passed by,

400
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,580
you might not have made it.

401
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,780
Did you hear that?

402
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,940
You're not tough.

403
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
You're just lucky.

404
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,100
What if Guozhu wasn't there?

405
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
What about the guy who stabbed you?

406
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,060
Did you see his face?

407
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,300
No.

408
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,220
It was raining heavily that night.

409
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,700
The alley was pitch black.

410
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,620
I couldn't see a thing.

411
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,260
I only remember

412
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,460
that the guy who hit Ran was soaked.

413
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,900
I was just about to cuff him.

414
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Suddenly, a shadow appeared
in the alley.

415
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,700
It came at me with a knife.

416
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,980
He was incredibly fast.

417
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,140
The knife strike was
swift, precise, and deadly.

418
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,660
That guy is a pro.

419
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,900
After stabbing me, he ran off.

420
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,060
I pulled out my gun and fired.

421
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,580
I hit his shoulder.

422
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,420
Really?

423
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes.

424
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,460
His left shoulder twitched.

425
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,020
So I'm sure of it.

426
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,340
Alright,

427
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,100
stop worrying about it.

428
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,580
Xiaoguang is looking into it.

429
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,540
You just focus on getting better.

430
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,220
I'll check on you later.

431
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,820
Guozhu,

432
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm sorry

433
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,940
for dragging you into this.

434
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,100
What's with the apologies?

435
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,060
We're on the same team, Ran.

436
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,940
What's really going on with you?

437
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,220
They all went for you with deadly force.

438
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,980
Who did you offend?

439
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,100
So, your neighbor Zhou Xiaoxiao's death

440
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,900
was just the trigger for all this?

441
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,300
The trouble isn't over, right?

442
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
Because of Xiao,

443
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,100
my father and I
started researching meth.

444
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,620
That year, we helped the Huazhou police

445
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,740
crack the 93 Major Drug Case.

446
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,540
The leader of that drug gang
was Song Kang.

447
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,580
Everyone called him Brother Song.

448
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,100
After he was arrested,

449
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,020
his drug gang

450
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,020
fell apart completely.

451
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,820
So, that Long guy who attacked you

452
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,580
was one of Song Kang's men.

453
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,740
After Song Kang was arrested,

454
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,940
Li Wenlong went to jail for a year

455
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
for assault.

456
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,300
He was released after serving his time.

457
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,900
That was in the summer of 1994.

458
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,020
I was abroad for an exchange program

459
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,660
and left for half a month.

460
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
On 5th August,

461
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,500
I flew for twelve hours and returned.

462
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,220
I still remember the typhoon
that day was called Karen.

463
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,420
The entire Huazhou was shrouded in rain.

464
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,620
[Summer of 1994]

465
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,940
The moment I got home,

466
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,980
I knew something was wrong.

467
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,310
My dad is a neat freak.

468
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,830
The house is always spotless.

469
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,150
But that day.

470
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,110
Dad?

471
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,670
Dad, I'm back.

472
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,230
Dad?

473
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,870
Welcome back.

474
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,390
Who are you?

475
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,190
How quickly you forget, scholar.

476
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,470
My year in jail was for nothing?

477
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,350
You're the one who caught my dad.

478
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,550
Where is he now?

479
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,190
Let me think about where he is.

480
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,430
Tell me where you are.

481
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,510
I'll come to you and you let him go.

482
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,310
Too late.

483
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,830
Your dad doesn't seem
to be moving anymore.

484
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,310
He's not breathing either.

485
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,550
Don't hurt him!

486
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,590
No one can hurt him now.

487
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,870
Where are you?

488
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,470
Where are you?!

489
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,070
I'm downstairs.

490
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,510
Hello?!

491
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,950
Li Wenlong!

492
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,950
Li Wenlong, open the door!

493
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,510
Li Wenlong, open the door!

494
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,190
Li Wenlong, open the door!

495
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,430
Li Wenlong!

496
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,190
After I calmed down,

497
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,510
I reported it to the police.

498
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,830
But the call wasn't recorded.

499
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,510
The license plate was fake too.

500
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,990
There was no evidence

501
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,510
proving that Li Wenlong was the killer.

502
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,270
The police later searched his residence

503
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,950
and found nothing.

504
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,710
But I refuse to believe

505
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,430
a person can just disappear like that.

506
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,590
Even a body wouldn't
vanish into thin air.

507
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,110
Since then, I've been
looking for my father.

508
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,750
So because of

509
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,710
the white building meth case,

510
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,110
you decided to come to Halan, right?

511
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,910
Yes.

512
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,510
The purity of the meth in both cases

513
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,390
was too similar.

514
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,390
I suspect Song Kang's men

515
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,350
brought the original formula
to the Northeast,

516
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,630
trying to make a comeback.

517
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,270
And you think Long was involved?

518
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,430
Yes.

519
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,070
It's a slim chance,

520
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,910
but I can't let it go.

521
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,830
I'm so selfish.

522
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,950
What are you saying, Ran?

523
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,790
You're not selfish at all.

524
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,670
It's normal.

525
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,550
Anyone in your shoes would do the same.

526
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,110
Remember when Liang ran away,

527
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,710
weren't you the one who chased him down

528
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,790
after running several kilometers?

529
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,350
And the trouble with those drug dealers
like Sangang?

530
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,830
And all those teaching plans?

531
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,150
You stayed up all night

532
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,110
just to make sure

533
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,190
we could tell all those drugs apart.

534
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,110
How can you say you're selfish?

535
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,870
Calm down, will you?

536
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,990
Don't tear your stitches.

537
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,430
See that?

538
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,950
That's the voice of the people.

539
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,390
We all know what you are like.

540
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,470
Don't bottle things up.

541
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,990
Stop trying to be a lone hero.

542
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,030
Don't you feel burdened?

543
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,070
Right.

544
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,390
Ran, it must have been tough for you,

545
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,510
chasing after this for so many years.

546
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,190
After that call,

547
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,150
I lost my dad.

548
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,830
And I lost my home.

549
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,110
I didn't want to leave Huazhou,

550
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,470
because I was afraid
of missing any clues about my father.

551
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,950
Now, I'm here in Halan

552
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,790
to find him

553
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,870
and bring him home.

554
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,550
There are so many of us.

555
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,350
We're all here to help you.

556
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,670
We'll find him for sure, Ran.

557
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,470
Let me top it up for you.

558
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,070
Remember this lighter?

559
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,790
Sorry.

560
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,350
I have asthma. I don't smoke.

561
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,510
Li Wenlong.

562
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,630
It's me.

563
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,550
Who was with you
when you stabbed my colleague?

564
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,270
Tell me.

565
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,950
I don't know him.

566
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,790
Never seen him before.

567
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,150
Look where you are now.

568
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,870
Stop pretending.

569
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,070
Think carefully.

570
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,030
I really haven't seen him.

571
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,030
How can I know?

572
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,670
Then why did you attack the police?

573
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,070
I thought he was a bad guy.

574
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,110
He was following me.

575
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,790
I didn't know he was a policeman.

576
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,150
Even if someone bad was following you,

577
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,190
shouldn't you have called the police?

578
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,150
And you were just a few steps away

579
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,910
from the station.

580
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,990
Instead of calling the police,

581
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,990
you pulled out a knife

582
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,670
and started to threaten others?

583
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,870
What's that about?

584
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,630
It was really dark that night.

585
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,030
The rain was pouring down.

586
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,510
And he kept following me.

587
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,670
I was scared.

588
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,870
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

589
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,070
I'll pay your medical bills.

590
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,390
Who wants your money?

591
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,030
I'm fine now.

592
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,590
Just can't wait to put you behind bars.

593
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,750
Hey,

594
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,590
I've always been

595
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,670
a law-abiding citizen.

596
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,470
It was just a misunderstanding.

597
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,630
You police can't arrest innocent people.

598
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,590
My medicine.

599
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,270
My asthma acted up.

600
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,230
Give me my medicine.

601
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,790
Hurry!

602
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,110
Li Wenlong,

603
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,310
let me put it this way,

604
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,470
everyone here

605
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,190
claims to be innocent.

606
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,590
If you really are,

607
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,790
I'll make sure you leave here unscathed.

608
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,910
But if you're guilty,

609
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,110
the law won't forgive you.

610
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,630
And we'll make sure

611
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,470
to send you to jail.

612
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,430
Mr. Gu,

613
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,390
don't keep things bottled up anymore.

614
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,510
Here.

615
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,670
In the 1980s,

616
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,150
Brother Song was involved

617
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,390
in Halan's gang-related cases.

618
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,910
I was part of the task force
that cracked down on them.

619
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,600
Later, they all fled to the South.

620
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
Who ran,

621
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,760
who stayed,

622
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
we have the names.

623
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,080
I checked.

624
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,480
There was no Li Wenlong on that list.

625
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
His age doesn't match either.

626
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,760
This Li Wenlong is from Huazhou.

627
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,840
He must have been recruited by Song Kang
during the later years.

628
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,120
Ran, why didn't you tell us earlier?

629
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,160
We could have brainstormed together.

630
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,080
Many hands make light work.

631
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,240
I was only speculating
based on the meth's similar purity.

632
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,680
I thought the Lucifer gang

633
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,200
might be the same group from back then,

634
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,840
including Li Wenlong.

635
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
But my guess is highly subjective

636
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,120
and lacks any real evidence.

637
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
I didn't want to disrupt your thoughts.

638
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Indeed,

639
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,760
personal speculations
can't be considered evidence.

640
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
I also checked on Li Wenlong.

641
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,640
He moved to Halan after his release

642
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,520
and opened a plant shop

643
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
near the northern bird market.

644
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,760
He sells flowers and plants.

645
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,360
No criminal record in recent years.

646
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,120
Theoretically,

647
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,640
he could have turned over a new leaf.

648
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,520
This is frustrating, really frustrating.

649
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,760
Look how arrogant Li Wenlong is.

650
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,920
If he truly reformed,

651
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,600
would he still be attacking people
on the street?

652
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,160
We know he's guilty,

653
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,880
but why is it so hard to find evidence?

654
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,040
If evidence was easy to find,

655
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
you wouldn't have a job.

656
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,000
This is what we do.

657
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,200
These are just my speculations.

658
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,560
But your speculations are sound.

659
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,040
Yes.

660
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,800
Bei once said

661
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
that if he committed a crime,

662
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,600
he'll inevitably leave traces behind.

663
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,080
We'll find it together.

664
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,360
Bei,

665
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,440
what if this Long guy is just a thug,

666
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,720
and is only responsible for assaulting,

667
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,440
but not for drug trafficking?

668
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,200
So what?

669
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,000
Isn't assaulting people a crime?

670
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,760
Can't we arrest him because of that?

671
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,160
Bring him in, and we'll investigate.

672
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,400
If he's involved in drug trafficking,

673
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
then that's great,

674
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,320
we'll have a breakthrough.

675
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,400
If he's not,

676
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,880
we still need to resolve
what happened to Ran's father.

677
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,920
- Right.
- Right.

678
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
Thank you all.

679
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,000
Don't say that.
This is what we should do.

680
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,880
Now, let's eat some buns.

681
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,600
Buns.

682
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,520
Uncle always shows up just in time.

683
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,840
Now, I get why you said

684
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
there's someone behind Qin Yi.

685
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,400
It makes sense now.

686
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,840
No wonder you suspected him back then.

687
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,440
Because

688
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,040
Li Wenlong wasn't among those
who got caught.

689
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,760
Right?

690
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,200
Two months ago,

691
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,400
I accidentally saw Long at the hospital

692
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
and found out he was in Halan.

693
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,000
The same meth showed up here.

694
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,520
Too many coincidences.

695
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,120
Two months ago?

696
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,920
So you secretly rented

697
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,720
that place two months ago?

698
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,240
Sorry.

699
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,320
No need to apologize.

700
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,920
You've seen how complex society is.

701
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,160
Don't waste your money.

702
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,680
Just move back.

703
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,360
The bureau won't arrange it, but I will.

704
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,680
Alright, I'll move back right away.

705
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,440
Ran,

706
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,400
what did you use to attack Li Wenlong?

707
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,280
Right.

708
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,920
Yes.

709
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,240
A perfume bottle?

710
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,000
Right.

711
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,120
I modified it from a perfume bottle.

712
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,720
Ran, you're so creative.

713
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Don't smell it.

714
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,520
Put it down.

715
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,560
What's wrong?

716
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,960
I was caught by Qin Yi last time.

717
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,000
I had no strength to fight back.

718
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,160
I'm not like you.

719
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,240
You are all good at fighting.

720
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,240
So I had to use some chemistry.

721
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,720
Not everyone is good at fighting.

722
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,280
For example, I'm not.

723
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,240
But this thing works.

724
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Come on, Xiaoguang, try it.

725
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,840
Stop.

726
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,320
If you like it, keep it, Guozhu.

727
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,200
For self-defense.

728
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,440
Really?

729
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,400
Thanks, man.

730
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,520
Why is it short by a month?

731
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,400
Here it is.

732
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,240
Bei,

733
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,720
Guozhu's parents are here.

734
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,160
They've come to confront me?

735
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,600
Take it easy.

736
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,080
Sir.

737
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,840
This is heavy.

738
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,680
Madam.

739
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,760
Sir.

740
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Give him a hand.

741
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,520
He is so happy.

742
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,520
Officer Zheng,

743
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,760
we are deeply grateful to you.

744
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,920
Our useless boy

745
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,960
has finally made something of himself.

746
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,280
We've heard all about it.

747
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,520
He dared to fight criminals

748
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,560
and even fired a gun.

749
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,480
He got injured

750
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,720
and earned a hero's medal.

751
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,520
Yes.

752
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
We didn't raise him for nothing.

753
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,200
If Guozhu heard you say that,

754
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,280
he'd be thrilled.

755
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,320
- Right?
- Yeah.

756
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,440
Don't let him hear it.

757
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,440
If you praise

758
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,360
that boy,

759
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,600
he'll get too proud.

760
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,520
No way.

761
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,560
Wait, isn't Guozhu here?

762
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,080
Where did he go

763
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,320
during working hours?

764
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,360
Guozhu.

765
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Mom.

766
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,400
Son.

767
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,880
Where did you hurt yourself?

768
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,800
Let me see. Come here.

769
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,320
No, I'm fine.

770
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Who told you I was hurt?

771
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
You're brave now.

772
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
No need for those scary stories anymore.

773
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,920
You're the best policeman.

774
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,600
That's right.

775
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,680
Ding Guozhu is now fearless.

776
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,200
We all need to learn from him.

777
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,080
Salute!

778
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,240
Guozhu, you're our role model.

779
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,400
Don't get cocky.

780
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,320
What's this, Guozhu?

781
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,000
Look at you.

782
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,840
Be a grown-up, Guozhu.

783
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,880
He's crying.

784
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,440
What's wrong?

785
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,560
Son.

786
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,240
Look at you.

787
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,160
Okay.

788
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,920
Mom is also proud of you.

789
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,640
Mr. Gu.

790
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,880
Stop crying.

791
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,760
From now on, I've got your back.

792
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,920
This is your home, okay?

793
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Why do you wear perfume?

794
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,420
[Mr. Zheng Great Chicken Ribs]

795
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,680
The car broke down just
as we turned into your street.

796
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,200
Isn't that weird?

797
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,200
You are a police officer.

798
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,600
No superstitions.

799
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
This just means...

800
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,200
This means this old car needs repairs.

801
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,200
Only when it is safe to drive,

802
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,160
can you serve the public.

803
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,080
Now, check if your car is overheating.

804
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
I'll start packing up.

805
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,600
Take your time.

806
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,400
Okay. I'll catch up with you in a bit.

807
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,440
What are you staring at?

808
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,720
Pack your things.

809
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Look at this place you picked.

810
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,680
My car breaks down whenever I come here.

811
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,360
What?

812
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,840
Wipe your hands.

813
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,480
They're dirty.

814
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,920
Seems like you've been scavenging.

815
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,000
Not now.

816
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
They'll just get dirty again
when I finish.

817
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,240
You can always wipe them again.

818
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,120
You are just like my mom.

819
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,200
Everything's ready?

820
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,240
Yeah.

821
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,160
Then let's move.

822
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,920
Hold on, take this plant.

823
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,680
Is it dead already?

824
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,520
Not dead, just wilted.

825
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,480
In this dark,

826
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,880
gloomy room,

827
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
with no sunlight

828
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,040
nothing can thrive.

829
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,040
Since I was a kid,

830
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,360
I never liked keeping plants or pets.

831
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,960
Everything I take care of dies.

832
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,520
Let me tell you,

833
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,080
plants are easier to care for
than humans.

834
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,440
A little water, some sunlight,

835
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,520
and it'll be fine by tomorrow.

836
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,360
Your sister says the same.

837
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,680
I told her to send this plant to you,

838
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,600
hoping it would bring some life
into your room.

839
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,920
Sorry.

840
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,160
No worries.
My bad for not telling you earlier.

841
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,680
I'll take it back,

842
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,400
and nurse it back to health.

843
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,840
With some light

844
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,240
and water,

845
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,320
it'll perk up like a flower in no time.

846
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,400
Understood?

847
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,960
It is a flower itself.

848
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,440
But it seems you didn't understand
how to care for a flower.

849
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,360
What are you doing with it?

850
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,160
I'll sleep on this.

851
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,200
You sleep in the bed,

852
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,120
I'll take this.

853
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,360
I'm used to sleeping on it.

854
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,400
Look at you.

855
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,400
It's good to have you back.

856
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,040
We can chat

857
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,760
and look out for each other
going to and from work.

858
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,520
It's you who's always
looking out for me.

859
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,760
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

860
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm your big brother, anyway.

861
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,920
Nothing is supposed to be a given.

862
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
Taking care of me
isn't your responsibility.

863
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
You'll get too tired,

864
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,160
so maybe you shouldn't
have to be my big brother.

865
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,160
Why are you taking this so seriously?

866
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,880
I already manage a bunch of people.

867
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,920
One more won't make a difference.

868
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,960
You see.

869
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,640
You take on too much responsibility.

870
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,840
What do you mean?

871
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,880
I mean, you worry too much.

872
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,840
You don't need to
think about me so much.

873
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,080
Hey,

874
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,640
it's not about how much I think of you.

875
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,560
Many things

876
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,040
will be much better

877
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,360
if you can just talk about them.

878
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
Don't bottle it up.

879
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,680
Indeed.

880
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,600
When you all said you believed in me,

881
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
it gave me a wonderful feeling,

882
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,240
like I suddenly perked up.

883
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,800
That's the power of a team.

884
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,120
See, dude?

885
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,640
Thanks.

886
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,840
No worries.

887
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,720
No need to be so formal.

888
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,640
Road.

889
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Bun.

890
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,240
That's a bicycle.

891
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,560
That's a child.

892
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,600
Don't tell me

893
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,200
you are speaking Cantonese.

894
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,680
It's not even close.

895
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,440
How is it not?

896
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,240
It's perfectly standard.

897
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,120
"Child" is "siu lo,"

898
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,920
and "bicycle" is "daan ce."

899
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,760
We're talking about the same thing.

900
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,560
Every morning,

901
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,480
I spend half an hour with the CD player

902
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,160
learning Cantonese.

903
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,640
That's how it's pronounced.

904
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,280
Well, that's not how Mr. Gu says it.

905
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,360
Don't compare me to Mr. Gu.

906
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
He's a native of Huazhou,

907
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,480
but I'm not.

908
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,200
Well,

909
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,720
Mr. Gu has already moved back home.

910
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,760
Maybe

911
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,440
I should go learn from him.

912
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,560
No, Nan.

913
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,080
After going through all this,

914
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,200
he is still weak.

915
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,680
Better not bother him.

916
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,920
He's got my parents and my brother
taking care of him.

917
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,800
He'll probably be fully recovered
in a few days.

918
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,640
Alright.

919
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,760
Then why don't we
call him Zheng Yiran from now on.

920
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,560
Zhao Xiaoguang, stop right there.

921
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,480
What are you talking about?

922
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,340
[Closed]

923
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,240
We've got the analysis report back.

924
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,480
The weapon used by the killer

925
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,240
seems to be a 303 standard police knife.

926
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,080
I've had Yao and others

927
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,840
check where such items might be sold.

928
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,400
It's partly my fault

929
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,800
for not remembering his features.

930
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
After the beating,

931
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,520
it's a miracle you
remember anything about him.

932
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,600
Surviving is good enough.

933
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,160
Li Wenlong's detention is up
in seven days.

934
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,280
I've made arrangements.

935
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,680
The moment he's released,

936
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,400
we'll have him under full surveillance.

937
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,000
If anything happens,
we'll take him down immediately.

938
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,160
Let's get started.

939
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,160
- Look at these kids.
- Let's get to eat.

940
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,160
You could talk about the case endlessly.

941
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,480
If you were this dedicated
to finding a girlfriend,

942
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,000
I'd have nothing to worry about.

943
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,880
Gosh,

944
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,000
you always know how to hit a sore spot.

945
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,520
Let me tell you, today,

946
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,200
no shop talk.

947
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,440
Mr. Gu is back home,

948
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,560
so we'll just enjoy eating and drinking.

949
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,200
Alright.

950
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,720
Xiaoguang, quickly.

951
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,640
Quickly.

952
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,160
Steamed bun. Take this.

953
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,080
Here.

954
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,800
Today,

955
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,600
I want to make a toast.

956
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,080
Xiaoguang, pour drinks for everyone.

957
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,280
Sure.

958
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,560
Go ahead.

959
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,640
I've already reported this.

960
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,200
Today, we're having a little drink
to welcome you back.

961
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,480
Yes.

962
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,400
Today, we welcome Mr. Gu home.

963
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,000
- Right.
- We must have a drink for that.

964
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,800
It's like a big family reunion.

965
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,200
Cheers.

966
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
Thank you.

967
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,240
Alright.

968
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,720
Mr. Gu.

969
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,000
Am I part of this family?

970
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,800
You'll have to ask if my girl agrees.

971
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,760
Mom, what are you saying?

972
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,320
Of course, I don't agree.

973
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,480
See?

974
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,200
It's better

975
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,080
if you didn't ask.

976
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,000
Bei.

977
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,560
Come on.

978
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,880
Mr. Gu,

979
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,160
here's to you.

980
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,080
Here I go.

981
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,640
Ran,

982
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,480
you know, Dad isn't good with words,

983
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,360
but I've always been proud of you.

984
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,480
Dad, why are you saying this?

985
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,480
Come on, here's to you.

986
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,920
I've had enough.

987
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,600
Even though you're just going abroad
for an exchange this time,

988
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,920
you've never been away from home.

989
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,920
Dad is still a bit...

990
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,560
worried, you know.

991
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,120
Don't worry, Dad.

992
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,760
Two weeks will pass
in the blink of an eye.

993
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,520
I can take care of myself.

994
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,280
Son,

995
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,160
Dad will be waiting for you
to come home.

996
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,880
A reunion.

997
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
Cheers.

998
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,560
Look at this kid.

999
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,800
So sincere.

1000
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,760
Take your time with the drink.
There's plenty more.

1001
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,400
Dad, don't hold up Mr. Gu.

1002
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,000
He's been through a lot.

1003
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,280
Let him vent.

1004
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Ran, don't worry.

1005
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,160
With Bei and me here,

1006
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
no matter how big Halan is,

1007
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,160
your dad's affairs...

1008
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,360
Watch your mouth.

1009
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Stop being silly.

1010
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,920
Why are you bringing that up
while we're eating?

1011
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,520
No, I just...

1012
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,480
I'm not good with words,

1013
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,280
but I know

1014
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,240
that ever since I came to Halan,

1015
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,160
you all have treated me

1016
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
like family.

1017
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,120
I remember every kindness
you've shown me.

1018
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,040
I'll finish this drink in one go.

1019
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,800
No, don't.

1020
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,080
Don't do that.

1021
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,440
Do you think you can drink a lot?

1022
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,440
Don't say "you."

1023
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,320
It's "us."

1024
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,280
If you really mean it,

1025
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,880
then down a bottle instead.

1026
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,320
What's the big deal about that?

1027
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,000
Then you do the same?

1028
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,120
No, forget it.

1029
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,960
You drink it yourself.

1030
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,040
Come on, let's eat.

1031
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,480
Let's eat.

1032
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,240
- Eat.
- Nan,

1033
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,720
how's your Cantonese coming along?

1034
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,000
Mr. Gu just got back.

1035
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,520
Don't trouble him.

1036
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,280
I didn't.

1037
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,280
Mr. Gu found me a new tutor.

1038
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,320
Xiaoguang is making good progress.

1039
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,800
Forget it.

1040
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
He's not as good as me.

1041
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,720
Alright, I'll eat some meat

1042
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,000
to keep my mouth shut.

1043
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,200
Madam, do we have pickles or something?

1044
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,560
Look at me.

1045
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,720
I almost forgot.

1046
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,040
The pickles Zheng Bei brought back
last time

1047
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,400
were so authentic

1048
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,280
and delicious.

1049
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,120
How about you get the recipe for me?

1050
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,880
- Okay?
- I can't believe it.

1051
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,160
No one is better than you
at making pickles.

1052
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,800
- They were really good.
- What pickles?

1053
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,040
The ones you brought back
a few days ago, remember?

1054
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,520
The ones made by

1055
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,920
Jiang Xiaohai's sister.

1056
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,960
He brought them to the station,
and I brought some back.

1057
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,240
That Jiang Xiaohai sure has good taste.

1058
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,240
He brought a whole box
to the station that day.

1059
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,680
If Ran hadn't had his accident,

1060
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,040
I would've eaten two jars on the spot.

1061
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,920
Are they good?

1062
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,920
Absolutely.

1063
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,280
They were top-notch.

1064
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,320
I was just about to cuff him.

1065
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,520
Suddenly, a shadow appeared
in the alley.

1066
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,240
He was incredibly fast.

1067
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,160
It came at me with a knife.

1068
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,840
The knife strike was
swift, precise, and deadly.

1069
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,520
This guy is a pro.

1070
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,680
I didn't see that.

1071
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,840
You're quite a fighter.

1072
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,960
I did time, you know.

1073
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,880
Went in young,

1074
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,000
and got bullied.

1075
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,800
Then I started training

1076
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,640
with a martial arts guy inside.

1077
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,840
How tall was that guy

1078
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,760
who attacked Guozhu?

1079
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,000
About the same height as Li Wenlong,

1080
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,200
maybe a bit shorter.

1081
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,920
Shorter?

1082
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,640
Hello?

1083
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,560
Xiaohai,

1084
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,800
this is Zheng Bei.

1085
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,880
Bei.

1086
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,760
What's up? Got a cold?
Your voice sounds different.

1087
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,120
I was already in bed.

1088
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,400
Sleeping?

1089
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,240
Alright,

1090
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,360
then I'll talk to you another time.

1091
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,320
No, I'm up now.

1092
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,440
What's the matter? Tell me.

1093
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,880
Nothing much.

1094
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,840
I was just at home
eating the pickles you gave me.

1095
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,880
My mom couldn't stop praising them.

1096
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,800
She told me to thank you

1097
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,320
and ask for your sister's recipe.

1098
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,160
How did she make them?

1099
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh, no worries.

1100
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,640
I'll give you more.

1101
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,760
I wouldn't feel right
asking for more all the time.

1102
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,880
On the day you gave us pickles,

1103
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,360
did you pass by that alley

1104
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,040
when you went back?

1105
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,000
Did you see anything unusual?

1106
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,480
I was on night duty that day,

1107
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,000
so I didn't take my usual route home.

1108
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,040
Why? Did something happen?

1109
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,280
No, nothing serious.

1110
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,720
We'll talk about it when we meet.

1111
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,120
Are you sure everything is alright?

1112
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,400
If nothing is wrong, I'll sleep.

1113
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,440
Alright.

1114
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,640
Hey,

1115
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,040
tomorrow, I'll come over,

1116
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,160
and we can go to the bathhouse

1117
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,400
to soak for a bit.

1118
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,560
Bei, don't bother.

1119
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,440
I've had a mild fever lately.

1120
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,360
Let's do it another time, alright?

1121
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,480
I'll hang up.

1122
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,640
I'm really going to sleep now.

1123
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,680
Bye.

1124
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,360
What's going on with you?

1125
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,160
You've got a lot on your mind.

1126
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,720
Your Northeast dialect
is coming along nicely.

1127
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,080
You're quick to pick things up,

1128
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,200
truly a scholar.

1129
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,320
You didn't even finish your meal.

1130
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,960
Did you find something?

1131
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,440
The timing of when Jiang Xiaohai
brought those pickles to the station

1132
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,880
was within ten minutes
of when the incident happened.

1133
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,280
Do you suspect him?

1134
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,840
His height and build match,

1135
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,360
but I'm not sure.

1136
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,120
We'll have to see.

1137
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,320
I'll arrange to meet him tomorrow

1138
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,080
to check.

1139
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,360
If it's really him,

1140
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,520
there should be a gunshot wound
on his shoulder.
