You treated Xiao as your sister.

194
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,020
I should've noticed sooner.

195
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,660
It's not your fault.

196
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,220
Since Xiao started

197
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,740
dating that gangster,

198
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,140
she hasn't come home.

199
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,580
It must be that guy

200
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,740
who got her into drugs.

201
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,940
Dad,

202
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I have to go.

203
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,500
Auntie.

204
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,100
Ran.

205
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,460
Auntie,

206
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,460
what's the name of that guy?

207
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,780
Huang Jiahui.

208
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,820
Who is it?

209
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,180
Hurry up.

210
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,540
Police. Don't move!

211
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,540
What's the matter?

212
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,540
Don't move!

213
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,780
What's up?

214
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,780
What's happening?

215
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,620
You've got the wrong person.

216
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,620
Officer.

217
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,580
I told you it's not...

218
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,060
It's not me.

219
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,380
Hurry up.

220
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,100
It's not me.

221
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,300
Sir.

222
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,020
Sir.

223
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,740
You've got the wrong person.

224
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,260
Get in.

225
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,060
Slow down.

226
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,300
You're breaking my arm.

227
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,340
Get going.

228
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
This was later found at the scene.

229
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,460
The murderer is likely from out of town,

230
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
arriving by train on the 2nd.

231
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:27,320
[Suspect:? Huazhou]

232
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,500
Has the coroner's report come in yet?

233
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,940
The report has been sent here.

234
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,340
The man who fell was Song Wen.

235
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,740
The one upstairs was Song Wu.

236
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,740
They're brothers.

237
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,580
Both were security guards
at the Dongtie Glass Factory.

238
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,340
Song Wu had multiple stab wounds

239
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,620
and died from excessive blood loss.

240
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,340
Song Wen also had knife injuries.

241
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,740
But the cause of death
is still under analysis.

242
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,060
We're not sure if he was alive
when he fell.

243
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,300
What about the one who got away?

244
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,500
We haven't found him.

245
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,420
The tech department

246
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,860
is currently comparing
the third person's fingerprints

247
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,300
with those of all the factory workers.

248
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,900
Oh, right,

249
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,780
take a look at this.

250
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,420
This.

251
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,140
These shoes are

252
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,820
part of the standard issue
from that factory.

253
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,540
At the scene,

254
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,380
apart from the murderer's shoe prints,

255
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,660
only these shoe prints were found.

256
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,660
Both are size 42.

257
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,420
They match those brothers' sizes.

258
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,500
Besides that,

259
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,980
the tech department
hasn't found anything new.

260
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,780
We can only wait.

261
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,540
Is the reporter here?

262
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,660
What's his name again?

263
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,940
Jiang Xiaohai.

264
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,260
Here, have some water.

265
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,860
Thank you.

266
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,260
Take it easy.

267
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,620
We just want to ask you some questions.

268
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,580
Have some water.

269
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,100
In the statement,

270
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,340
you said you saw a stranger
that day, right?

271
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,300
Yes.

272
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,580
A new face.

273
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,740
Not from our factory.

274
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,620
Then why did you let him in?

275
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,580
They came by car.

276
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,340
"They"?

277
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,020
Song Wen was driving.

278
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,880
Hai, open the gate.

279
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Wu, why are you here so late?

280
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,960
A guest was visiting us.

281
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,190
Don't worry.

282
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,840
What did the guy look like?

283
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
Did you get a good look?

284
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,160
It was too dark.

285
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,440
I could only tell he was young.

286
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,120
In early twenties.

287
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,920
What about his build?

288
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,120
Build...

289
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,760
He looked about my size.

290
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,080
Was there

291
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,240
anything odd?

292
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,960
They didn't talk much.

293
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,880
They seemed pretty serious.

294
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,240
They got out of the car
and went up to the White Building.

295
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,280
You saw them get out of the car?

296
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,280
Yes, I did.

297
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,840
How tall was he?

298
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,120
You mean the stranger?

299
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,680
He was a bit shorter
than the two brothers.

300
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,160
About 1.6 to 1.7 meters.

301
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,720
Oh,

302
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,120
when they drove in,

303
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,680
I saw the person in the backseat

304
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
holding a bag

305
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,520
really tightly.

306
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,800
What kind of bag?

307
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,320
About this size.

308
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,360
Bigger than a typical bag.

309
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,480
How did you know

310
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
something happened upstairs?

311
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,120
I was almost asleep.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Around midnight,

313
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,200
I heard an argument upstairs.

314
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Couldn't make out
what they were arguing about.

315
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,800
It sounded like a fight.

316
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
I didn't want to get involved initially.

317
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,200
I was too tired.

318
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,920
Then shortly after,

319
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,480
there was an even louder noise

320
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
from the back of the building.

321
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
So I got up, put on my clothes,

322
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
and went to check.

323
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Chill out.

324
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,120
We're at the public security bureau.

325
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,040
Don't be afraid.

326
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Alright, that's about it.

327
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

328
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
You can go back now.

329
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,240
If you remember any more details,

330
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,400
feel free to contact us.

331
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,280
Yes, sir.

332
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,760
Take it easy.

333
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Help!

334
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,040
Help!

335
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,320
Help me!

336
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,160
We had a new discovery.

337
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,080
When the medical examiner
cut open Song Wen's clothes,

338
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,920
he found a small pocket inside.

339
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,600
The substance in the pocket
seemed to be drugs.

340
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,040
It has been sent for analysis.

341
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,520
When they drove in,

342
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,200
I saw the person in the backseat

343
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
holding a bag

344
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
really tightly.

[Drug Dealing]

[Drug Dealing, Profit Splitting?]

347
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,760
A black backpack was missing
from the scene,

348
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,760
likely taken by the murderer.

349
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,800
It probably contains drugs.

350
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
That makes sense.

351
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,760
The cash at the scene
must be drug money.

352
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,360
Another drug trafficking case?

353
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,560
What's been going on lately?

354
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,520
These drug dealers
are getting out of control.

355
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,320
Negative?

356
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,400
Negative.

357
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,160
We busted them right at the deal.

358
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,360
Huang Jiahui was obviously

359
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,920
high as a kite.

360
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,440
But we couldn't find anything.

361
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
Is the urinalysis only for heroin?

362
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,680
Maybe he

363
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
used other drugs?

364
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
We suspect

365
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,360
he used a new drug

366
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,400
that's not within our
current testing range.

367
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,080
A synthetic drug.

368
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Meth?

369
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,160
Exactly.

370
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,840
We do suspect it's meth.

371
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,920
But this type of meth is new.

372
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,840
Our current testing technology

373
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,840
is outdated.

374
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
If we had sent all the evidence

375
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
for testing elsewhere,

376
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
by the time

377
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,480
we got the results,

378
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Huang Jiahui might have already fled.

379
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,680
What can we do?

380
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,040
My back hurts.

381
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,320
Li,

382
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
thanks for your hard work.

383
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Bye.

384
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Officer,

385
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,840
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

386
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,080
Are you the guy
from downstairs that day?

387
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
You reported me, didn't you?

388
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,160
What do you want?

389
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,720
Go away.

390
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,480
We know each other.

391
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,160
It's okay.

392
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,480
Wastrel.

393
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,440
What did you say?

394
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,720
I said you're a wastrel.

395
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,840
I've done my research.

396
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Your name is Huang Jiahui.

397
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,400
Middle school dropout,

398
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,000
no skills,

399
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
lazy all day,

400
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
no job,

401
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,520
just living off women's money, right?

402
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,680
Hey, don't be so cocky.

403
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
How can I compare with you?

404
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm studying at the police academy.

405
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
You're in the underworld.

406
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Besides taking drugs and fighting,

407
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,080
what else can you do?

408
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,800
You...

409
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,600
What?

410
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,480
If I were your parents,

411
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,400
I'd regret having a son like you

412
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,040
for life.

413
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
What do you want?

414
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,720
What are you doing?

415
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,360
Stop him!

416
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,360
What did you say?

417
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,960
Stop him.

418
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,440
Take him back!

419
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,120
Arrest him.

420
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,880
Say that again!

421
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,800
Shut up!

422
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Wait till I get out.

423
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,920
Wait till I get out, brat.

424
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,080
What are you doing?

425
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
Are you alright?

426
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Hey,

427
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,720
how long would someone

428
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,640
be locked up if they started a fight
at the police station?

429
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,400
You did it on purpose?

430
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,760
Aren't you worried he might run away?

431
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,760
No way he can get away here.

432
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
But it might not last

433
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
until the test results come back.

434
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,400
The lab where my dad works

435
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,480
is a qualified testing organization.

436
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,080
And I have the expertise

437
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
to assist

438
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
in improving efficiency.

439
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,680
You can have someone oversee
the entire process.

440
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,560
Could you help me get an opportunity?

441
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
What do you say, Professor Gu?

442
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,400
I've worked with the police a lot.

443
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,520
But meth is different
from traditional drugs.

444
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,640
And different types of meth
have variations

445
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,520
in their production processes.

446
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,440
Our current technology
and equipment are limited.

447
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,360
So, we can't detect it

448
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,800
in such a short time.

449
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,680
Our lab technician said the same thing.

450
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,000
Indeed.

451
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,080
So we can only wait
for the report from elsewhere.

452
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,600
Thank you for your help, Professor Gu.

453
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,200
It's okay.

454
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,440
I'll bring my colleague back.

455
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,360
Get some rest.

456
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,640
Let my son try.

457
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,560
He's more persistent than me.

458
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,040
He also wants to seek justice
for his sister.

459
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,040
Let him try.

460
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,440
[Halan Public Security Bureau]

461
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Bei, do you think they might have
made a mistake?

462
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,760
With so many people on the train

463
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,240
and meth being a new type of drug,

464
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,320
it's normal if someone missed it.

465
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,560
Not likely.

466
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,400
Those guys are veterans.

467
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,760
They are experienced.

468
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,160
Even if they haven't seen meth,

469
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,840
they've seen plenty of
heroin and ecstasy.

470
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
He was carrying a large bag.

471
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,360
They couldn't have missed that.

472
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,160
Then what's the problem?

473
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,600
We have our guys at the train station.

474
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,880
Technically, they wouldn't
let him pass easily.

475
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm thinking

476
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,400
the guy from Huazhou

477
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
might not have come alone.

478
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,600
He had accomplices.

479
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,720
But that security guard,

480
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,280
Jiang Xiaohai,

481
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,800
said that apart

482
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,200
from Song Wen and Song Wu,

483
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,080
the murderer was the only stranger
entering the factory.

484
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,200
Just because he entered
the factory alone that night,

485
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,840
doesn't mean he didn't have
accomplices outside.

486
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,200
Besides, we can't fully
trust Jiang Xiaohai.

487
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,680
You think he's lying?

488
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,600
His recollection seemed too clear.

489
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,200
What did the person following him say?

490
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Sun has been following him these days.

491
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,480
Nothing unusual so far.

492
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,320
Give it to me.

493
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,360
Let me keep it for you.

494
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,120
Give it to me.

495
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Who wants this stuff?

496
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Hey.

497
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,600
What time is it now?

498
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,960
It's past six in the morning.

499
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,480
I'll go get you breakfast.

500
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,480
What would you like?

501
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,160
Don't bother.

502
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,280
You should contact the bureau.

503
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,560
Why?

504
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,160
The test results are out.

505
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
Let me take a look.

506
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,960
Absolutely not.

507
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,480
It has to be handed over
to Officer Zheng.

508
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,960
It's fine. Let me take a look.

509
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,880
What are you talking about?

510
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,840
Bei, you're back.

511
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,640
This is our captain.

512
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,200
Officer Zheng,
I'm from the Testing Center.

513
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,600
Director Gao asked me
to deliver this report.

514
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,640
Where's Director Gao?

515
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,600
He's in a meeting
with municipal officials.

516
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,240
[Identification Report]
He wanted you to look at this first.

517
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,880
Alright.

518
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,360
This is the test report of the drug

519
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
found on Song Wen's body.

520
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,520
The main component of the evidence is

521
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,000
methamphetamine hydrochloride,

522
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
also known as solid meth.

523
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,160
You cracked it?

524
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,280
The main component is
methamphetamine hydrochloride.

525
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,400
Here's the complete test report.

526
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,320
Also, based on the
various component levels,

527
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,840
I've drafted a formula
for your reference.

528
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,120
And the purity is extremely high.

529
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm heading back to the bureau

530
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,600
to get a search and arrest warrant.

531
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
Is that what Director Gao
went to the meeting for?

532
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,920
Exactly.

533
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,480
Alright, I understand.

534
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,800
Then I'll be leaving.

535
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,880
Wait.

536
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,920
Amine? Hydrochloride?

537
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,240
What... What is this?

538
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,960
You look so serious.

539
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,160
Is there a problem?

540
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,400
This is meth.

541
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,760
- What?
- What?

542
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,240
It's in Halan?

543
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,600
Meth?

544
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I've only seen it
on the news and reports.

545
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,360
It's a new type of drug, right?

546
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,080
Similar to ecstasy?

547
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,560
It's indeed a new synthetic drug.

548
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
But its harm is much greater
than that of ecstasy.

549
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,880
We've only found
this small package so far.

550
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
No one knows how much of it

551
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,960
is circulating throughout Halan.

552
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,920
The murderer carried such a large bag

553
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,120
when he escaped from the White Building.

554
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,920
If it was full of this stuff,

555
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,560
how much would there be?

556
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,320
That'd be a lot.

557
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Bei,

558
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,200
you've arrested
the most drug dealers and users.

559
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,480
How is this made?

560
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,560
I catch drug dealers.

561
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
I don't make drugs.

562
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,000
How would I know how it's made?

563
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Ask something helpful.

564
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
When I

565
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,240
went to

566
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
the provincial bureau for training,

567
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,880
they mentioned

568
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,680
that opium,

569
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,160
marijuana,

570
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
and heroin

571
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,640
are all

572
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,000
plant-based drugs.

573
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,600
Their yield depends on the weather,

574
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,920
like crops.

575
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,280
So, what about drugs

576
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,640
like meth

577
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,520
and ecstasy?

578
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,360
They are chemically synthesized drugs.

579
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
You can make them

580
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
in any lab.

581
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
The yield can be enormous.

582
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,480
Highly profitable.

583
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,440
My goodness.

584
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,280
Meth's been around
in the south since 1991,

585
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,560
so it's not shocking

586
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,280
it's here now.

587
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,320
Not shocking?

588
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
There's nothing normal about it.

589
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,880
No drugs is what's normal.

590
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,840
You're a cop. Quit that mindset.

591
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm telling you,

592
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,760
I can't control what happens elsewhere.

593
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,720
But in Halan,

594
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,440
if there's drug dealing,

595
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
we shut it down.

596
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,040
Understood?

597
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,480
Yes, sir!

598
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,320
That night,

599
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,240
the police found a large amount

600
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,280
of unsold meth at Huang's residence.

601
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,080
Huang and his accomplices were arrested.

602
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,800
Based on Huang's statement,

603
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,840
the Huayun District police
followed the lead

604
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,640
and finally took down

605
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
a major drug ring

606
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,840
with a severe impact.

607
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,160
New drug crimes

608
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,160
have been on the rise
in the last two years.

609
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
It's all over now.

610
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,680
It's not.

611
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,840
Every time I close my eyes,

612
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,040
I see her lifeless face.

613
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,360
Son,

614
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,400
you've done everything

615
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,280
you could.

616
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,800
When I was young,

617
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,320
I couldn't protect Mom.

618
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
Now I couldn't protect my sister.

619
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
In the end, I'm the useless one.

620
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Have you read the report?

621
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,240
Director Gao,

622
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,000
I've been a detective for years.

623
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,880
And you've seen it,

624
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,880
no criminal I've got my eyes on

625
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,080
ever gets away unscathed.

626
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,080
Right?

627
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,880
No matter what drugs
they're trafficking,

628
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,360
we just need to catch them.

629
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
Cheer up.

630
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
I'll resolutely

631
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,600
follow your instructions.

632
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,360
I really admire your attitude, kid.

633
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,840
What else can I do?

634
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
The bureau has already

635
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,000
reported the situation to higher-ups.

636
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,440
Due to the severity of this case,

637
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,640
they've decided to
form an investigation team

638
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,400
and appoint you as the leader

639
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,240
to specifically handle this case.

640
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
It's not just about solving
this murder case.

641
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,920
The bigger concern

642
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
is the drug trafficking ring behind it.

643
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,800
In short,

644
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,680
drugs

645
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
cannot exist in Halan.

646
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Absolutely.

647
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,600
But we

648
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,960
still have

649
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,560
other cases pending in our team.

650
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,840
If I leave,

651
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
what about those kids?

652
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,800
You're acting like a kid.

653
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
They're all in their
thirties and forties.

654
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,400
What?

655
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
Can't they function without you?

656
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Isn't it just the ecstasy case?

657
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,280
I've got Xiong and the team
keeping an eye on it.

658
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,360
If needed,

659
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,280
you can lend a hand.

660
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,200
Director Gao,

661
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,200
I was just discussing

662
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,880
with Xiong and the team

663
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,440
that we don't have

664
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,400
a dedicated anti-drug unit.

665
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,680
Meanwhile,

666
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
in the Major Crimes Unit,

667
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm the one who's caught
the most drug dealers.

668
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,600
Xiaoguang has learned something from me.

669
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,560
If we're putting together
an investigation team,

670
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,360
we need the best people.

671
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,600
You're quick on the uptake.

672
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,760
Who do you have in mind?

673
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Tell me.

674
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,240
First, we need

675
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
a forensic expert.

676
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,440
The fingerprint comparison result
for the murderer

677
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,240
at the White Building
still hasn't come out.

678
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,000
It's holding us back.

679
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,840
We need to improve efficiency.

680
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,720
So we definitely

681
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,400
need a forensic expert.

682
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,200
Also,

683
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,320
we need someone tough.

684
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,920
This murder case shows

685
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,120
dealing with these drug dealers

686
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,440
involves confrontations.

687
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
We need someone who can take charge,

688
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
fight,

689
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,840
and has good physical abilities.

690
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,520
Right?

691
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,840
What do you think of this lineup?

692
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,000
So we're bringing in two new colleagues.

693
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,440
A forensic expert

694
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,360
and a good fighter?

695
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,840
You got it.

696
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,360
Where are they?

697
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
In the conference room.

698
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,920
Look at his build.

699
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,040
It's impressive.

700
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,600
Truly a good fighter.

701
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,640
Look at his muscles.

702
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,200
Ding Guozhu!

703
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
Criminal Tech Department. Ding Guozhu,

704
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,000
reporting in.

705
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm Zheng Bei.

706
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Hello, Captain Zheng.

707
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,480
Welcome to the investigation team.

708
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,480
Thank you.

709
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,640
Hello, I'm Zhao Xiaoguang.

710
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,680
Hello, Xiaoguang.

711
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,160
Nice to meet you.

712
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
You're from the tech department?

713
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,720
With your build,

714
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
I thought you were a boxer.

715
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,240
Boxing, wrestling, Sanda,

716
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,400
I can't do any of that.

717
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,080
But I'm decent at calisthenics.

718
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,880
You're wasting your talents.

719
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,360
Well...

720
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,680
What do you know?

721
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,080
He graduated
from a criminal police academy.

722
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,880
He's a forensic expert.

723
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,200
My apologies.

724
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,520
So

725
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
where is the fighter?

726
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,040
She should be here soon.

727
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,000
Are you sure you want her?

728
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,200
Yes.

729
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,840
In the past two years, she arrested

730
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,480
about half of the criminals
for the Jiangtie bureau.

731
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,720
She's a good fighter.

732
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,160
Yes, she is.

733
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,840
But her personality...

734
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,520
Don't worry.

735
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,240
I'm her senior.

736
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I can handle her.

737
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,560
A female officer?

738
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,160
I didn't see that coming.

739
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,360
I'm quite excited.

740
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,880
Well, don't be.

741
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,800
Why?

742
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,760
Haven't you heard of Zhang Xueyao?

743
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,280
Who is she?

744
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,960
Do I know of her?

745
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,640
"Mad Dog Yao"

746
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,960
from Jiangtie bureau.

747
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,160
Mad Dog Yao?

748
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,320
Bei.

749
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,880
I know you're skilled.

750
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
But try to be serious.

751
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,040
Forget it.

752
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,680
I still lose to you every year.

753
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,360
What were you talking about?

754
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,160
Let me in on it.

755
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,800
Nothing much.

756
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
But I did hear "mad dog".

757
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,800
We were praising you.

758
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,120
Now, let me formally introduce you.

759
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,600
This is my junior.

761
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,720
Alright, that's enough.

762
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,640
If there's any major arrest operation,

763
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
I'll apply to the bureau

764

Bei, is it just us
in the investigation team?

When do we start the investigation?

767
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,960
There's one more person.

768
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,320
Let me recommend someone.

769
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,280
Mr. Gu from the Investigation Department
at Huazhou Police Academy.

770
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,280
He's also a seasoned drug expert.

771
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,040
I asked him to join
the investigation team.

772
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,160
But

773
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
he's not very interested.

774
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,400
And his colleagues there
don't want him to go.

775
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,400
That's fine.

776
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,080
We shouldn't

777

to come all the way here.

778
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,040
Right?

779

He's not that old.

780
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,600
It's not about age.

781
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,760
Capturing drug dealers

782
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,800
doesn't require

00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,200
a teacher, does it?

786

787
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
contains crystal sugar

788

789
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,000
I can't.

790

Neither can I.

Both contain crystal sugar.

792
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,640
People often think

793
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,160
all we do as cops is make arrests.

794
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,960
Some of the younger officers,
full of adrenaline,

795
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,280
can be a bit impulsive.

796
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,080
But you're different, Zheng Bei.

797
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,040
You're not a hothead.

Ever since you graduated
from the police academy,

800
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,320
it took you a year to make detective,

801
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,600
five years to reach the first rank,

802
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,720
and now you're already
a Chief Inspector.

I'm not saying that
drug knowledge isn't important.

But our job

812
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,800

To put it bluntly,

we could die at any moment.

815
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,840
You want a chemistry expert

who's never made an arrest

817
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,760
or been to a crime scene

What? Am I his bodyguard?

Don't give me that nonsense.

825
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,680
Let me put it this way,

826
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,920
our country is determined
to eradicate drug crimes

827
