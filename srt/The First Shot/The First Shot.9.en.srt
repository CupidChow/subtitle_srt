4
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,660
Welcome.

5
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,860
Drink it.

6
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,300
Come on.

7
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,460
Bottoms up.

8
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,260
Cheers.

9
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,060
It's so fun, Guo.

10
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Of course.

11
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,140
Mr. Wang.

12
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,620
Are you okay, Mr. Wang?

13
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,100
I'm drunk.

14
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,780
I can't drink any more.

15
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,020
I have to go home.

16
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,820
What about the factory director?

17
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Everyone's waiting for you
to drink with them.

18
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,060
No.

19
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,940
You only drank a little.

20
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,460
Let's drink beer.

21
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Beer.

22
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,500
What's that on the table?

23
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,980
Guo ordered it.

24
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Let's drink and let them play.

25
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,020
We can't touch this thing.

26
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,380
Really. We can't.

27
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,060
Alright.

28
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,020
Let me get you back.

29
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,620
I didn't want to come, but you insisted.

30
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,780
Why did you ask me to drink?

31
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,420
Go ask Mr. Huang to drink.

32
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay.

33
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,140
Then...

34
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,260
Let's make them drink.

35
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,740
Let's go.

36
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,500
Mr. Wang.

37
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,220
What took you so long?

38
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,340
Come here.

39
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,340
Come here.

40
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,540
Try this.

41
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,300
Join us.

42
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,980
Mr. Huang, I can't try this.

43
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,940
Really. I...

44
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,180
Impossible.

45
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,380
I toast you.

46
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,940
Let me toast you.

47
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,700
Beer?

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,540
Come on!

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,540
Guo.

50
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,380
Guo.

51
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,220
Come here.

52
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,900
Mr. Huang.

53
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
Why are you upset?

54
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,740
Bei, are you going to drink
on a mission?

55
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,460
Smell it.

56
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,860
When did you pour it in?

57
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
You startled me.

58
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,420
- Be quiet.
- What are you doing?

59
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,980
You brat.

60
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,700
Don't touch me. It will spill.

61
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Don't touch me.

62
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,620
What's going on?

63
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm done.

64
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,740
Nice.

65
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,980
It looks real.

66
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,580
But too much foam.

67
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,540
You got it for free. You're so picky.

68
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
I have none left.

69
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,620
Don't be sad.

70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,860
Gu gave my dad Longjing tea leaves.

71
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,180
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

72
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,860
I prefer my crushed black tea leaves.

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,420
Stop messing with my stuff.

74
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm not.

75
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,020
I'll drink it all tonight.

76
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,420
You'll wet your bed.

77
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,900
This tea has too much foam.

78
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

79
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,460
I would have given you red sugar water.

80
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
It's hematinic.

81
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,380
What are you looking at?

82
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,380
Sleep.

83
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,380
Let me tell you.

84
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,020
Don't cause trouble.

85
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,420
Understand?

86
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,100
We just came to take a look.

87
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,540
Alright.

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,300
You nagged all day.

89
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,860
I'm leaving.

90
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,300
Can you see with the glasses on?

91
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,900
Yes.

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,940
If you try it,

93
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,940
I'll give your factory a ton
of ethylene glycol.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,700
OK?

95
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Jianmin.

96
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,580
That's worth a lot.

97
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,140
You won't put me on the spot, right?

98
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,700
Don't put me on the spot.

99
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,420
Director, we can't touch this.

100
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,540
What are you afraid of?

101
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,900
I'm going home.

102
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,780
You fool.

103
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,220
Don't push your luck.

104
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,340
Teach him.

105
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,860
Come on. Teach him how to take meth.

106
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,380
- Teach him.
- Jianmin.

107
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,940
Give me the sunflower seeds.

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,700
Sorry, sir.

109
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,380
What are you doing?

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,060
Sorry, sir.

111
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,300
What are you doing?

112
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,820
What's up?

113
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Sen.

114
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,940
You guys...

115
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
Give the customers a new plate
of sunflower seeds.

116
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,020
Get the cleaners.

117
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,980
Sir, let me take you back.

118
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,700
Get lost.

119
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Sorry, sir.

120
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,300
Try it.

121
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Help!

122
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,540
Teach him.

123
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,140
I told you to teach him.

124
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,380
Gentlemen,

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,080
This girl is just a waitress.

127
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,000
She doesn't know this.

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
We have special staff
to take drugs with you.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,520
You don't need to pay.

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
My treat.

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,920
Come here!

132
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,880
Come here!

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,480
Cool down, sir.

134
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
I'll call the girls over.

135
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
I want her.

136
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,120
Apologize to this sir.

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,240
Sorry, sir.

138
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
Crawl over.

139
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,560
This way, sir.

140
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,120
What's wrong? This is my room.

141
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
I'll let you in as soon as the things
are settled.

142
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,720
- Whatever happened, I have to...
- Sir.

143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,400
Sir.

144
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,520
Whatever happened, I have to go in now.

145
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,240
Miss, please wait a moment.

146
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
They are handling things inside.

147
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,120
Restroom.

148
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
The restroom is over there, sir.

149
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
I have to go in.

150
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
I'll let you in after the things
are settled.

151
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
The restroom is over there.
Come with me.

152
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,640
Put away the meth.

153
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
Throw them in Sangang Alley.

154
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Water.

155
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
This is your water, sir.

156
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Buddy.

157
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Buddy.

158
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,360
Look.

159
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,160
Is it okay, buddy?

160
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,840
They are dealing drugs.

161
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,600
You forgot our mission.

162
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,520
Don't cause trouble.

163
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm leaving, bro.

164
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Go ahead.

165
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,520
Buddy.

166
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,680
Give me some.

167
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Have fun.

168
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Thank you.

169
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,520
Yours.

170
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,320
Thank you.

171
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,600
Yours.

172
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Thank you.

173
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,240
Thank you.

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Drink.

175
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Eat fruits.

176
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,080
Cheers.

177
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,640
Drink it up.

178
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,280
Can you hide?

179
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,720
They seem to have discovered us.

180
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm hiding well.

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
I've blended in.

182
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,000
What are you afraid of?

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Waiter.

184
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,520
Drink more.

185
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520
Give us two drinks.

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,440
What drinks?

187
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Coke with ice.

188
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
Coke is too expensive.

189
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,240
Coke is cheap.

190
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,080
Thirty yuan.

191
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,240
What?

192
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,040
Thirty yuan.

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's split it.

194
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
I have 10.5 yuan.

195
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,720
How much do you have?

196
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,360
Twenty... Twenty-five yuan.

197
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,760
Here you are, bro.

198
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Go ahead.

199
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
Add more ice.

200
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,040
Those two girls are hot.

201
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,280
Ladies, you came alone?

202
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
How old are you?

203
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,880
Eighteen.

204
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,240
My buddy

205
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,880
bought you Jack Daniels.

206
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,320
No need, bro. We have drinks.

207
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,080
Do you look down on us?

208
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
No, sir.

209
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,840
This is

210
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,160
my buddy's place.

211
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,480
Ladies, drink it.

212
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Humor me.

213
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Thank you.

214
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,040
Come to our table if you want to drink.

215
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
Have fun.

216
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,280
Okay.

217
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,320
We have to be careful

218
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
in such places.

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
We can't be reckless.

220
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,440
It will be dangerous.

221
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,560
I see.

222
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Cheers.

223
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
What's wrong with you?

224
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,400
Didn't you see us?

225
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,120
Sorry.

226
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Sorry.

227
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you out of your mind?

228
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,800
Go away, rascal.

229
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,560
You idiot.

230
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,920
What did you say?

231
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
That girl's wine was drugged.

232
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,640
What?

233
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,120
That girl's wine was drugged.

234
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,880
Don't look back. Go.

235
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,920
Go.

236
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,240
What should we do now?

237
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,000
Leave now. We can't fight.

238
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,200
Stop there.

239
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
Go, go.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,320
Over there.

241
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,800
Guys.

242
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,320
Stop there.

243
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,960
Hurry!

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,800
Hurry!

245
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,160
Make way, please.

246
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,720
Make way!

247
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Hurry up.

248
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,680
Get them.

249
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Hurry!

250
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,840
Go, go.

251
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,280
You run so fast.

252
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,080
Run.

253
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
Are we in the way?

254
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Drop the act.

255
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,960
Bro.

256
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
This is my first time in Halan.

257
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,200
We drank a lot.

258
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm dizzy.

259
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Sorry.

260
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,640
Sorry.

261
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,640
Sorry.

262
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,480
Stop playing dumb.

263
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,440
Sorry.

264
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,280
The wine messed you guys up.

265
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
Behave yourselves.

266
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,120
You hear me?

267
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
Stay away from me.

268
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
What are you doing here?

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Hurry up.

270
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Fight him.

271
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,360
Go.

272
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
You trash. Get him.

273
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,040
Buddy.

274
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
What are you doing?

275
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,360
What are you doing?

276
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,280
Move aside!

277
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
What's going on here?

278
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,880
Scram.

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,680
Who are you?

280
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,800
Behave yourselves.

281
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,320
Who is it?

282
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Here.

283
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,720
You idiots.

284
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Get up.

285
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Chase them.

286
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
Chase them.

287
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
Follow me.

288
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,000
Why are they fighting?

289
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,800
I don't know.

290
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,920
Are they drunk?

291
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,080
They're so noisy.

292
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,800
They seem to be fighting.

293
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
Let's go check it out.

294
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,440
Forget it.

295
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,160
Bei told us not to be nosy.

296
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

297
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,080
Go.

298
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,320
Bei.

299
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,120
What's going on over there?
It's so chaotic.

300
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,120
What happened to you?

301
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,680
Nothing.

302
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
They must have taken many drugs.

303
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
They are fighting.

304
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,840
They took ecstasy, right?

305
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,680
Meth.

306
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
Is it the meth

307
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,040
we found in the White Building?

308
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
How can I know?

309
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
We can take it back for a test.

310
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
Where are they?

311
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,120
Where are Mr. Gu and Xiaoguang?

312
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,400
I didn't see them.

313
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,880
We're in the karaoke bar.

314
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,640
Many guys took ecstasy there.

315
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Nothing else.

316
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
You checked the rooms?

317
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,760
Well, I couldn't stop her.

318
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
She just broke in

319
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
and sang.

320
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
She sang a song
and went to another room.

321
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,400
Over and over again.

322
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,640
Otherwise, her voice
wouldn't be so husky.

323
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,600
Come on.

324
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,080
What if you are recognized?

325
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm not afraid. You are here anyway.

326
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,360
You're so reckless.

327
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,000
Here. Run.

328
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,680
Go ahead. Leave me alone.

329
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,960
We have to run together.

330
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,400
We are outnumbered.

331
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,400
Go take a look. Quick.

332
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Be careful.

333
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Come on.

334
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
Fight him.

335
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Fight him.

336
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
This way.

337
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,400
Hurry up.

338
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
Crawl out of there.

339
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,640
Call them for help.

340
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,280
Hurry up.

341
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,640
Get up.

342
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,280
I told you to go. Why did you come back?

343
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,200
Quick.

344
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,360
Can you fight?

345
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm done.

346
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,880
What?

347
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,240
You only have a stupid stick.

348
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
You want to beat us?

349
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,720
I will beat you guys today.

350
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,800
I'll skin you alive.

351
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,440
You fool.

352
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,760
I'll see how far you can go
with this crip.

353
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,240
You were working on this
while I was getting beaten up.

354
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,360
If I hadn't done this,

355
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,040
we would be beaten.

356
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Ran.

357
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,960
Ran, go.

358
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,640
I can't walk.

359
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,440
Buddy, the fire is going down.

360
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
The fire is going down.

361
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,960
We have to go now.

362
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,000
Let me help you. Come on.

363
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,960
You go.

364
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Hurry up.

365
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,840
Go.

366
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Buddy, I'll go first.

367
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
Don't play with fire.

368
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
Bei.

369
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,920
You got helpers, huh?

370
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,400
What should we do?

371
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,640
Fight him.

372
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,480
Be careful.

373
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Ran, are you okay?

374
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
Xiaoguang, does it hurt?

375
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,560
My leg.

376
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,040
This leg?

377
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
Did you take everything out?

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,120
Lucifer?

379
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,760
So we are friends.

380
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,800
My goodness.

381
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,720
Look what you did.

382
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
I thought you were a plainclothes cop.

383
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,120
How could it be?

384
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,760
Come to me if you want to buy goods.

385
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,600
I'll give you a discount.

386
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,120
How much?

387
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,080
You're a big client.
Twenty percent discount.

388
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
Okay, this is better than my stuff.

389
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960
What are you talking about?

390
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,680
Drug dealing?

391
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,160
No. Come on.

392
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
We just take drugs.

393
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,840
Did you sell drugs?

394
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,320
Don't talk nonsense.

395
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,040
I didn't.

396
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,600
Get up.

397
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,360
Hurry up.

398
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,240
Take them away.

399
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,560
Go.

400
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,520
Quick.

401
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,720
You're so serious.

402
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Drop the act.

403
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
Get the cuffs off Bei.

404
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,920
What are you waiting for?

405
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,080
Is it so fun?

406
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
Bei, don't hold a grudge against me.

407
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
I'm just doing my job.

408
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,240
Why not?

409
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
You cuffed me.

410
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,280
I know the name of that meth.

411
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
It's called Lucifer.

412
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,160
Lucifer.

413
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,960
Yes.

414
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,160
Xiong.

415
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,120
Interrogate the guys
in that car carefully.

416
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,600
You have to get all information

417
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,480
about Lucifer out of them. Understand?

418
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,120
Yes, trust me.

419
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,200
I caught so many guys today.

420
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,320
Can I get a second-class merit?

421
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,600
Of course. You deserve it.

422
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,000
Yao,

423
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
we came in time, right?

424
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,840
You could come later.

425
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
I just began,

426
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
and you caught all of them.

427
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
I was just worried.

428
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,040
About me?

429
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
I was worried

430
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,080
you would kill them.

431
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,600
If so, we couldn't get anything
out of them.

432
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,000
Before the task,

433
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,760
what did I tell you guys?

434
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,320
What's wrong, Bei?

435
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,520
Guozhu and I just sang.

436
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
I did nothing else.

437
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
He is not talking about you.

438
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
He was indicating us.

439
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
What?

440
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
Bei.

441
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,680
You can't scold Ran.

442
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,320
We saved two girls.

443
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,040
Just rest.

444
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,120
What did you call him?

445
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,640
What are you doing?

446
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Ran.

447
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,200
Everyone calls him that, don't they?

448
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
You don't know

449
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,000
how brave Ran was.

450
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,200
He held a long stick

451
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
and scratched the ground with it.

452
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,280
Sparks flew.

453
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,960
The fire was taller than you.

454
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,960
Taller than me.

455
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,400
Really.

456
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,480
Lie down.

457
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Ran.

458
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,960
You're such a good friend.

459
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll remember this.

460
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,120
Alright.

461
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,760
You should have got your mouth injured.

462
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,760
Ran.

463
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Shut him up.

464
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
You're my friend forever.

465
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,280
Come on. Lie down.

466
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,680
Mao.

467
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,760
Mao.

468
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Quickly get up, lazybones.

469
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,280
It's getting late. Hurry up.

470
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm not going to learn the piano.

471
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,480
Are you going or not?

472
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Be good. You'll be late.

473
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Quickly get up. Okay?

474
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,840
Mom, I'll sleep five more minutes.

475
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,320
I'll get up in five minutes.

476
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
You can sleep again after coming back.

477
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,320
Be good.

478
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
We'll be late. Okay?

479
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Put it on.

480
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Or you can't get a star today.

481
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,360
I have eight stars.

482
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,400
Eight stars?

483
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,360
This is eight.

484
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,040
Alright.

485
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Quickly put on your clothes.

486
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll cook breakfast for you.

487
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
Come on.

488
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,640
Hello.

489
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
When?

490
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,620
[Halan People's Hospital]

491
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,920
Xiaoguang.

492
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,640
What happened to you?

493
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,960
I heard you were just scratched.

494
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Xiaoguang.

495
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,120
Xiaoguang.

496
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
It hurts.

497
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
Don't push me. It hurts.

498
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,560
Is it you, Fang?

499
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,160
Fang.

500
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,680
Why are you standing here?

501
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,600
I didn't say anything.
I just came to take a look.

502
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,880
You're so annoying.

503
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Why are you here?

504
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
He was not just scratched.

505
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,480
You fooled me.

506
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
He's fine.

507
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm alright.

508
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,160
It's sturdy.

509
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Come on.

510
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,560
It hurts.

511
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
My brother taught you bad things.

512
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,640
You don't take your body seriously.

513
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,600
Zheng Nan, stop it.

514
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,920
You hit him as soon as you came.

515
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,080
Xiaoguang.

516
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,520
Now you know it hurts.

517
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,600
I told you not to cause trouble.

518
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,280
But you wouldn't listen.

519
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
Bei, he's injured.

520
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,120
Don't scold him.

521
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,480
What's wrong with you guys?

522
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,400
Can you be quiet?

523
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,200
Sorry.

524
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

525
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,760
This nurse is so harsh.

526
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,880
Then

527
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,680
one of us stay here.

528
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,040
The rest go back to work.

529
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,680
I'll stay.

530
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,160
Can you?

531
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
You stayed up so late last night.

532
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,880
Yes. I should thank Xiaoguang.

533
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Come on, buddy.

534
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,320
We're friends.

535
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,800
Don't say that.

536
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
When did they become so close?

537
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
They are both young men.

538
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,040
Just a fight together made them friends.

539
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm leaving.

540
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,160
Let's go.

541
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,480
Nan, I'll take you back.

542
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,320
No.

543
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,080
I asked for leave.

544
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,440
It will be a bad bargain if I go back.

545
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
Then stay here.

546
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,920
I'll walk you out

547
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
and get the medicine.

548
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,440
See you, Bei.

549
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,520
You brought this for me, didn't you?

550
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,360
You're just eating by yourself?

551
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,720
I brought this
for a critically ill patient.

552
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,680
You were just scratched.

553
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,400
Well...

554
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Call Erjin.

555
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,960
I'll be there soon.

556
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,360
Jianmin.

557
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,680
Sorry

558
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,120
to make you

559
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
worry.

560
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,160
Don't be silly.

561
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,880
Does it hurt?

562
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,320
I brought you chicken soup.

563
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
The nurse said

564
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,400
you needed nourishment.

565
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,040
Drinking some hot soup

566
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,320
is good for your health.

567
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,520
Drink some soup.

568
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Take a sip.

569
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Come on.

570
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,840
Open your mouth.

571
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,080
Does it hurt?

572
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm fine.

573
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,560
My stomach is empty.

574
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,640
It feels nice.

575
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,440
It doesn't hurt.

576
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,640
Did Mao go to learn the piano?

577
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
I asked Xiaohai to take her there.

578
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,640
Don't worry.

579
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,320
Wait.

580
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,400
Well.

581
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,960
How's the director?

582
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,160
Nothing happened to him.

583
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
He's alright.

584
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,560
If not for him,

585
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,840
you wouldn't be injured.

586
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,360
Don't think too much.

587
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,680
Rest well.

588
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,960
Drink the soup up, okay?

589
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,520
Don't worry.

590
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,720
I'm okay.

591
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm feeling

592
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
well.

593
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,680
Look at you.

594
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,800
You're badly injured.

595
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,120
Yet you are still joking.

596
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,880
Have a good sleep.
