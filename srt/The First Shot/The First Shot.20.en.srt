00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,400
Hey, girl!

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
What are you doing alone?

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,440
Wait a moment.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,880
I know you've been down lately.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's go have some hotpot. My treat.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,320
Let's go...

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,120
We all

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,880
know your dad got arrested.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,240
So drop the act.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,960
Stop acting like a princess.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Move aside.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm curious, though.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,920
Why did your dad get arrested?

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,880
Murder?

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
Robbery?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,080
Or running this kind of shop?

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,160
Say one more word about my dad,

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,520
and I'll mess you up, got it?

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,040
No one's protecting her. Get her.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,600
Listen,

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,040
your dad's already in jail.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,760
You've got no one to back you up now.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,920
You should feel lucky I even fancy you.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
Don't push your luck.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,800
Let me tell you,

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
you're eating this meal,

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,280
whether you like it or not, understand?

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,640
Back when my dad was around,

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
you didn't dare say a word.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
Even if my dad did wrong,

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,000
he's still better than cowards like you.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Your dad's in jail now.

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,480
Not sure if he'll ever get out.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,080
You better drop
your princess attitude, got it?

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Hold her.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
Why is it you again?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Mr. Lin,

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
you recovered from your injury?

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,720
What's wrong?

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
Nothing.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Do me a favor.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Stay away from her.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,720
Alright.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm doing it for your sake.

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Just this once.

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,560
Let's go.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,200
Next time, use your eyes.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
Are you alright?

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
Why is it that my dad's in jail,

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
Mr. Qin is dead,

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
but you're still fine?

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,320
Why do you get to be innocent

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,280
without getting involved?

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,120
You can blame me

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,200
or hate me,

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
but think about Uncle Erjin.

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,440
If he knew you were living like this,

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,440
how worried he'd be.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
Let me walk you home.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't need you
playing the good guy here.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Get lost.

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Get lost!

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
You need to get some good sleep tonight.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
So tired.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll bring breakfast over tomorrow.

69
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Been trailing pusher for so long,

70
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,400
I've worn out two pairs of socks,

71
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,000
and there's still no progress.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
When will we ever catch the big fish?

73
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,600
What's the rush?

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
No case is easy to crack.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,960
Hold on.

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I have an idea.

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,880
We've been

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,960
tracing the retail level upward.

79
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
But there's been no breakthrough.

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
I thought about it.

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
What if we flip it around?

82
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,000
Work from the top down.

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
What do you mean?

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,880
From the top down?

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,000
You mean
starting with drug manufacturing?

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
We can't even confirm Mr. Ma's identity,

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
let alone find where the drug was made.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
No.

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Drug production is just
the middle of the chain.

90
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,160
The real source is
in the chemical raw materials.

91
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't forget,

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,320
today's meth

93
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
is chemically processed.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,440
Unlike before, when it was grown.

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
That's a good approach.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,360
We have the Lucifer's recipe,

97
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,080
so we can trace back the raw materials.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,400
How do you plan to investigate?

99
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,640
Think about it,

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,360
the raw materials for making meth

101
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
are mostly controlled substances.

102
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,120
Except for chemical plants
or drug companies,

103
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,920
ordinary people
can hardly get access to them.

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Factory profits and losses
are on record.

105
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
If we just go there for data,

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,560
we might tip them off.

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
But we could go to the banks

108
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
to apply for their financial records.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,040
Going to the bank?

110
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
Let me put it simply.

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,360
If a factory

112
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
supplies raw materials

113
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
to drug dealers,

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,160
its actual production will be way lower

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,640
than what it should be.

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,080
But the purchasing
and sales amounts should match.

117
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
These will be reflected

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
in their financial records.

119
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,400
So, those with high costs
and low income,

120
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,560
and timelines matching the appearance

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,440
of Lucifer

122
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,760
are our key suspects.

123
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
Alright,

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,040
starting tomorrow,

125
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
we'll split up the work.

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,520
Xueyao and Xiaoguang,

127
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,480
follow me to check on the pusher.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Guozhu, you follow Mr. Gu

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,080
to investigate the factories.

130
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,800
So let's get a good rest tonight.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,320
Got it.

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Tomorrow,
we begin strict investigations.

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,440
Okay.

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,160
Go home now.

135
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,400
- See you tomorrow, Ran.
- See you tomorrow.

136
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,080
Don't forget the breakfast, Bei.

137
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,480
Zhao Xiaoguang!

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Nan?

139
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Hey,

140
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
what are you two doing here?

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,080
What are you doing here so late?

142
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,360
I...

143
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
I borrowed some movies to watch.

144
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,200
What's up?

145
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
Why now? It's late.

146
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,840
You should go back.

147
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,440
Watch it tomorrow.

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
We're watching something else.

149
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
What are you watching?

150
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Relaxing with a crime movie?

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Just looking for some inspiration.

152
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Have a seat.

153
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
Sit down.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
Why don't you sit over there?

155
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
It's crowded there.

156
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,880
Besides, this spot is fine.

157
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
True.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
I forgot your eyesight isn't great.

159
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,880
Your eyes are the ones
that aren't great.

160
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
If you find me annoying, I'll leave.

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,080
No!

162
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,720
That's not what I meant.

163
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong with you today?

164
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Who got under your skin?

165
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,160
Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

166
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,640
Your parents are coming back.

167
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,120
Help me pick out some gifts.

168
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,400
They always bring me stuff.

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,720
I want to show my appreciation.

170
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,920
By the way,

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,560
there are some new tapes
at the Video Hall.

172
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
Let's pick some out together later.

173
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
Sure, no problem.

174
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
Why are you so quiet today?

175
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Ran doesn't like people talking

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
during a movie.

177
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
He'll get so mad.

178
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,280
My brother is such a pain.

179
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,240
So is that Mr. Gu.

180
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
He doesn't say a word

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,680
during a movie.

182
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Who watches a movie without chatting

183
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,400
or having snacks?

184
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Zhao Xiaoguang is right.

185
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,600
We're not even on the same wavelength.

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,640
So you've moved on so quickly?

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
It's frustrating to even think about it.

188
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,720
I've been trying to find a way

189
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
to spend some alone time

190
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,480
with Zhao Xiaoguang,

191
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
but every time,

192
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,280
he's busy with work,

193
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
or

194
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
my annoying brother

195
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,800
is hanging around.

196
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
What should I do?

197
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,880
Any ideas?

198
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
Well,

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,040
we girls can't just confess.

200
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,040
He likes you, anyway.

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Just seduce him.

202
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,080
Let him know you like him too.

203
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
Seduce?

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,720
I can punch,

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,800
but seducing...

206
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,440
I...

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
I can't do that.

208
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh my, don't be a coward.

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Just say something suggestive.

210
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
If that doesn't work,

211
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,800
make a move.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,160
You learned nothing
from all those romance movies?

213
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Why are all your movies romances?

214
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,960
Are you dating someone?

215
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,320
No.

216
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm just studying ahead of time.

217
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,080
I used to like Joker

218
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,320
from A Chinese Odyssey.

219
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,160
Then I liked Qiao Feng
from Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils.

220
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,960
Recently, I watched Emergency Unit.

221
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,640
I find Chen Xiaochun is handsome too.

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,600
Doesn't matter
if he's the main character or not,

223
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,080
as long as he's a police,

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,000
he just seems reliable.

225
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
So I'm just saying

226

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,200

Once you're with someone,

239
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
I'll step back.

Why are you here at this time?

248
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360

350

the raw material consumption is so high.

351
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
Small factories can't meet the demand

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,440
of the drug dealers.

353
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
So we have to target

354
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,520

355
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,640
What if they do the opposite?

the greater the risk.

she went missing after work.

454
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,320
Didn't come home all night.

455

Her parents reported it to the police.

When her body was found,

457
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,440
it had been submerged in water

458
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,600
that we couldn't pinpoint

459
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,720
the exact time of her death.

460
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,640
But it's certain she'd been dead
for over 72 hours.

Also, look,

with a blunt object.

465

When her body was discovered,

467

there were no valuables on her.

robbery and murder.

What's up with her teeth?

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,120
The medical examiner said

472
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,560
she bit the killer during the struggle.

473

Look at the damage to her teeth.

474
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,200
She must've used all her strength.

475
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,600
I think

476
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
the killer definitely has bite marks.

477
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
Did you find anything in her nails?

we found no human tissue,

The medical examiner believes

she was conscious

483
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,080
when she hit the water.

484
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,160
But the rope loosened,

485
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,880

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,040
I'm just here to

569
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,880
ask you a few questions,

570
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
since you were Han Li's
direct supervisor.

571
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Understood.

572
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm ready.

573
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,280
I'll help however I can.

574
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
How was Han Li's relationship

575
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
with her coworkers?

576
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,280
Is there anyone

577
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,840
she didn't get along with?

578
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,600
Han Li was straightforward,

579
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
and blunt.

580
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,280
Officer Zheng, as you know,

581
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,040
finance workers

582
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,640
rarely make friends easily.

583
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,160
But there wasn't anyone

584
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,640
she had issues with.

585
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,400
How was her relationship
with the Director?

586
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Most business with the Director

587
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
went through me directly.

588
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,680
She didn't interact

589
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
with the Director very much.

590
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,000
Sorry, I haven't offered you tea.

591
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,520
Here, let me.

592
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
No, don't bother.

593
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

594
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Let me take a look.

595
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,800
It's nothing.

596
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,400
A while back,

597
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
I was out with the Director
for business.

598
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Let me see.

599
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
They were drunk.

600
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,640
There was a scuffle,

601
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,360
see,

602
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,760
and I got burned.

603
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,520
What's up with her teeth?

604
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,920
The medical examiner said

605
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,080
she bit the killer during the struggle.

606
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,640
My goodness.

607
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,800
That's a nasty burn.

608
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,400
Wang, you should let it breathe.

609
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Put some oil

610
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,040
or burn ointment on it.

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
This is so bad.

612
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
Your wife must be really worried.

613
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,160
Let me get you some tea.

614
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,000
No, it's fine, Wang.

615
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll be quick with my questions.

616
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,880
Please, sit.

617
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Alright, Wang, let's get back to it.

618
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,000
Han Li didn't have any enemies.

619
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,480
But did she have anyone
she was close to?

620
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,440
I don't remember anyone in particular.

621
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,560
What about her relationship with you?

622
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Officer Zheng,

623
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,440
what are you implying?

624
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,960
We were just coworkers.

625
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,200
In this photo,

626
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Han Li is clearly leaning toward you.

627
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,360
That kind of unconscious body language

628
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,680
shows she feels close to you.

629
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,520
Wang,

630
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,640
this photo wasn't like this
when we found it.

631
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,080
Your wife's face was covered in ink.

632
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
See this mark here?

633
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,840
Right?

634
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,200
Wang,

635
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
I know

636
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,200
that to the outside world,

637
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,600
you're seen as a good husband
and father.

638
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
But was it

639
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Han Li's one-sided love

640
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,120
or...

641
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,760
We had no improper relationship.

642
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
So you were aware she liked you?

643
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,600
I pretended not to know.

644
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,240
I didn't want things to become awkward

645
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,960
at work.

646
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,800
I feel sorry

647
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,120
for what happened to her.

648
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,720
Officer Zheng,
when you catch the killer,

649
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,320
please let me know.

650
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,160
We worked together for so many years.

651
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
I want her

652
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,360
to rest in peace.

653
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Enough.

654
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,240
Yao and I

655
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,080
asked every house

656
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
along Han Li's route home.

657
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,600
Whether it was the kebab sellers

658
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,520
or the passengers of her daily bus,

659
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,760
we asked until we lost our voices.

660
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,960
No one saw her.

661
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
It's strange.

662
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,840
Didn't she go home

663
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,000
after work?

664
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,120
Guozhu,

665
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,800
any updates on the body?

666
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,920
The full autopsy report
will be out tomorrow,

667
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,360
but the medical examiner said

668
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,040
the body had been in the water too long.

669
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,440
Whatever evidence there was

670
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,320
might have been washed away.

671
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,760
What about the lethal weapon?

672
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,040
It's almost certain.

673
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,680
An entrenching tool.

674
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,600
The blunt force trauma on the body

675
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,720
and the notches on the bridge

676
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
are both caused by the entrenching tool.

677
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,320
The wounds on the body are rough.

678
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
At first, I thought it was an axe,

679
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
but after testing,

680
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
I realized

681
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,240
the killer used

682
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,160
a well-worn entrenching tool.

683
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,360
The wear on the blade
caused the rough wounds.

684
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
Great work, Guozhu.

685
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,560
Bet your arms are sore
after all that swinging, huh?

686
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,320
How come your grip is so strong.

687
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,880
Actually, the simplest methods work best.

688
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Not only did we
confirm the lethal weapon,

689
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
but we can now infer the killer

690
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,040
might be a fishing enthusiast.

691
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,680
A fishing enthusiast?

692
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,880
Of course,

693
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,560
that's one possibility.

694
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,920
I used to fish with my dad,

695
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,720
and he loved bringing
an entrenching tool.

696
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,960
People who fish in the wild

697
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,320
often go to remote places

698
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,920
with few people and plenty of fish,

699
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,720
where they need to clear brush.

700
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,360
The tool is perfect for that.

701
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
Good for cutting grass,

702
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
and you can dig for worms
if you're out of bait.

703
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,840
Guozhu,

704
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,160
well done.

705
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,360
When I visit your parents next time,

706
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,360
I'll give you a good pat on the back.

707
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,760
Of all the people Han Li knew,

708
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160
only Wang Jianmin likes fishing.

709
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,840
He also owns a car.

710
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,120
Since Han Li's disappearance,

711
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,680
he hasn't gone fishing once,

712
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,200
spending all his time
at home with his family.

713
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,120
No, thanks.

714
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,160
But something feels off.

715
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,480
You've already confirmed

716
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,120
through Han Li's friends,

717
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,040
she wasn't seeing anyone, right?

718
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,680
We checked the hotel records.

719
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,440
No evidence of any relationships.

720
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,360
Han Li was just one-sidedly
in love with Wang Jianmin.

721
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,920
But Wang Jianmin has a happy family.

722
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
Why would he murder her?

723
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,320
Indeed.

724
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,840
Han Li and Wang Jianmin
had relationship issues,

725
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,040
but that's not enough
of a motive for murder.

726
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,040
Until we figure out
the primary crime scene,

727
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,000
who the killer is remains unknown.

728
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,520
We should move quickly.

729
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,960
Since Wang Jianmin is the only clue
that we have,

730
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,320
let's track all his movements

731
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
on the day Han Li disappeared.

732
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
If he's innocent,

733
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,680
we can rule him out.

734
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
Wang Jianmin has a car,

735
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,760
so,

736
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
he'll be easier to trace.

737
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,080
Let's get to it.

738
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,080
Okay. No problem.

739
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,720
Excuse me, sir,

740
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,840
you set up your stall here
every day, right?

741
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,520
What's going on, madam?

742
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,680
You're banning me?

743
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,360
I've been here for years.

744
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,680
I've never heard of any restrictions.

745
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,080
No, relax.

746
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,240
Nothing like that.

747
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,000
Just wanted to ask

748
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,280
if you saw this car on Tuesday night.

749
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,280
With all the cars coming and going,

750
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,200
how could I remember this one?

751
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,440
What about the driver?

752
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,280
Does he look familiar?

753
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,200
Actually, yeah, I do remember him.

754
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,360
Really?

755
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,280
Yeah.

756
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,120
That night,

757
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,080
it was so hot,

758
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,200
not many passengers on the street.

759
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,520
So I was packing up early to head home.

760
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,200
He was very polite to me,

761
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,560
so I remembered him.

762
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,600
Thanks to the vendor's information,

763
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,960
we've pinpointed the crime scene.

764
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,240
Did you see this person

765
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,440
in the afternoon of 3rd April?

766
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,480
No, I didn't.

767
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,280
Think carefully.

768
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,120
About this tall.

769
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,880
What about this car?

770
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,600
White.

771
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
No, haven't seen it.

772
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,480
Not around this street?

773
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,640
No wonder our earlier searches

774
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,560
turned up nothing.

775
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,000
It's in the opposite direction
of Han Li's home.

776
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,280
If I were planning a murder or attack,

777
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,160
I'd choose a secluded spot.

778
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,840
This place is right in front
of the police station.

779
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,680
Isn't that a bit too bold?

780
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,920
If Han Li had screamed for help,

781
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
he would've been caught on the spot.

782
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
Is he crazy?

783
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,520
Wang Jianmin is a finance guy,

784
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
sharp as a tack.

785
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,600
He's definitely not crazy.

786
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah.

787
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,480
So why would he choose here?

788
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
Tell Guozhu

789
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,480
to send the blood to the station.

790
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,200
After analysis,

791
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,960
the blood at the crime scene
is confirmed to be Han Li's.

792
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,600
Don't you think
he has a split personality?

793
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
On the one hand,

794
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,920
he's silly enough to murder

795
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
so close to the police station.

796
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,080
But on the other hand,

797
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
he's cautious enough

798
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,280
to dump the body somewhere else.

799
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,920
Scholars are better with their pens
than their hands.

800
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
If you told me to drag a body that far,

801
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,880
I couldn't do it.

802
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,840
The Xianfeng Road police station

803
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,120
isn't where Wang Jianmin usually goes.

804
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,640
Even if the body were found there,

805
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,080
no one would suspect him.

806
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,480
No matter what his motive is,

807
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,920
the hospital confirmed one thing.

808
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
He stayed in the hospital,

809
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
but his left hand wasn't injured at all.

810
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
If he didn't have anything to hide,
why did he lie?

811
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
We should just bring him in.

812
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,600
Interrogate him,
and we'll know everything.

813
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,000
When we were interviewing people
at Yunhui Pharma,

814
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,920
one of Han Li's coworkers mentioned

815
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
she photocopied a financial ledger

816
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,600
just before leaving that day.

817
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,920
The coworker saw it from a distance,
and didn't think much of it.

818
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,440
At the time,

819
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,160
we also assumed

820
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,680
it was just routine finance work.

821
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,560
But now that I think about it.

822
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,640
What if it wasn't that simple?

823
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,080
Look,

824
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,920
the Xianfeng Road police station

825
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
is the nearest one
to the pharmaceutical company,

826
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,040
and Han Li's home

827
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,640
isn't in that direction.

828
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,640
Is it possible

829
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
that Han Li was planning
to report to the police that day?

830
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,800
Maybe Wang Jianmin had no choice

831
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,440
but to act there.

832
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
Our joint investigation
with the major crimes unit

833
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,720
was because we suspected Yunhui Pharma

834
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
might be involved
in drug-related activity.

835
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,240
Han Li probably found something wrong,

836
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,240
and the ledger she copied
could be the evidence.

837
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Maybe Wang Jianmin silenced her

838
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,720
to destroy that evidence.

839
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,840
If that's the case,

840
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,480
everything makes sense.

841
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,840
We'll have a word with Wang Jianmin.
