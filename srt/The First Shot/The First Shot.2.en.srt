00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,480
Hello.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,280
Come in.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,720
I'm looking for Mr. Gu

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
from the
Criminal Investigation Department.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,840
That's me.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,800
That's you?

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,520
You're the chemistry professor?

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,360
How do you do?

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,080
Gu Yiran.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,720
Oh. Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,720
Please sit. I'll make some tea.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,160
No need for that.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm from Halan.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
I know.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,520
Officer Zheng, right?

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,120
Yes.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,040
I've heard about you.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
I don't have fancy tea here.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,440
Hope you don't mind.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,000
It's okay. Anything is fine.

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,720
You look so young, Mr. Gu.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
What year were you born?

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,280
In 1970.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,280
In 1970?

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,280
Yes.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,560
You're two years younger than me.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,520
Quite accomplished for your age.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm flattered.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,040
Okay, thank you.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's get down to business.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
Okay.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,920
I like straightforward people.

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,040
So, the reason

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm here

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
is to invite you to Halan

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
to help us with a major meth case.

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,440
Have you heard about it?

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
Yes, I've heard.

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,040
Good.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Actually,

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,040
I feel like I'm imposing
by asking you this.

42
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,000
But our director insisted

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
I come personally to invite you.

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,240
I have no choice.

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,160
Mr. Gu,

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
if you're

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
not interested,

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
just tell me.

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,880
I completely understand.

50
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm glad we understand each other.

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Sorry to make you come all this way.

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Take your time with the tea.

53
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,800
Close the door on your way out.

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
I have a class.

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,920
Maybe we'll meet again, Officer Zheng.

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,240
You are

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,960
busy here, huh?

[Episode 2]

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,320
Did you not understand what I said?

62
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040
I delivered the message,

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,200
but he's not interested.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
What can I do?

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,160
He's fine here.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,080
Still wearing short sleeves.

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,840
It's freezing where we are.

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Who'd want to go?

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,640
How is this my fault?

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Whose fault is it then?

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
You probably didn't try hard enough.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,760
What more do you want?

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,600
I said everything I needed to say.

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
You're being unreasonable.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
I know what you're doing.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
Don't beat around the bush.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,720
I'll tell you what to say.

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,040
Just tell me,

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
what kind of person is Professor Gu?

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
What kind of person?

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,840
He is quite polite.

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Also,

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
he smiles all the time.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,120
He seems

85
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,400
approachable at first,

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,760
but he is...

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
How should I put it?

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
He is a little weird.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
He seems nice.

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
But he's difficult to get close to.

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,640
I don't get it.

92
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
You're contradicting yourself.

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,400
Are you pulling my leg?

94
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Why would I do that?

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm just telling it like it is.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
He is complicated.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,480
I delivered the message.

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,640
Mission accomplished.

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
I'll pack up

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
and get an airplane ticket back.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Hold on.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
You're planning to return alone?

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,880
What else can I do?

104
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,440
You've been against

105
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,920
bringing Mr. Gu to Halan.

106
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,840
You happy now?

107
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,280
It's him who doesn't want to go.

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Why would I be happy?

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Just the way things turned out.

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Don't give me that.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,120
For this case,

112
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
Director Zhao even got us

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
a full set of chemical equipment
from the provincial department.

114
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,440
If Mr. Gu doesn't come,

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,600
who's going to use it?

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
Let me tell you, Zheng Bei,

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
we need a drug expert
like him for this case.

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
If you don't get him,

119
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
don't bother coming back.

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Gao, enough already.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Now we...

122
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
Hanging up so fast.

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
You're so tough now.

124
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,760
Always giving me impossible tasks.

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Not letting me go back?

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
What's next, banishment?

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
Just great.

128
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,880
Mr. Gu,

129
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,960
you're having a meal, too.

130
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,920
What a coincidence

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,240
to run into you here.

132
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Mr. Zheng, you can use my card.

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
Teachers get a discount.

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,160
Oh no,

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,680
I wouldn't dare.

136
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,960
Don't pull that
"fight after courtesy" routine on me.

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
What do you mean?

138
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,840
Just like before,

139
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,160
you were nice

140
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
and all smiles.

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
Then turned me down right after.

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
You can't do that.

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
Right.

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,320
Just like that smile.

145
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
Nothing good follows it.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,160
Am I right?

147
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
You know I'll refuse,

148
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,280
so why waste time?

149
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,520
It's almost six.

150
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,840
This guy gets up so early
to run every day?

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,840
Ran

152
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
is the most disciplined person I've met.

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
Before he's tough on others,

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,120
he's tough on himself.

155
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
In that sense,

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
he'd make a great detective.

157
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,480
Being a detective isn't easy.

158
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,400
We've been doing this for years

159
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
and have all kinds of injuries.

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
He's got thin arms and legs.

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm not sure

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
he's cut out for it.

163
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't underestimate him.

164
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,280
Do you remember the case from 1993?

165
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
I heard our director mention it briefly.

166
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,200
Well?

167
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
He solved it?

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
Back then,

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,520
our forensic technology wasn't advanced.

170
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
We had to send evidence out of town,

171
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,840
which took over ten days.

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
Ran

173
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
in just three days,

174
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,800
he managed to identify
the meth composition

175
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,440
and even drafted a formula for us.

176
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
That formula

177
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,560
is still a huge help

178
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
in our drug enforcement work today.

179
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,880
You guys are serious

180
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
about your drug busts.

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Even studying the raw materials.

182
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
That's impressive.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,800
He is coming.

184
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Thanks.

185
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Mr. Gu.

186
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,000
Good morning.

187
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,760
Senior.

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
Officer Zheng, you're still here?

189
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,440
Can't leave

190
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
with the job unfinished.

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Sorry.

192
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,360
After my workout,

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,350
Of course.

381
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,030
Where is it?

382
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,750
Go from here to the end.

383
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,550
Turn right and then go to the end.

384
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,630
There it is.

385
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,830
Turn right and go to the end?

386
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,710
I don't remember
there is an office there.

387
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,550
Go, take a look.

[First Dining Hall]

389
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,590
It must be a mistake.

390
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,230
Well,

391
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,710
wait for me.

392
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,430
I'll ask someone.

393
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,070
Bei.

394
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,470
No mistakes.

395
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,750
It's here.

396
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,990
I've missed you so much

397
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,310
these past few days.

398
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,410
[Special Investigation Team]

399
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,910
Come in and take a look.

400
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,790
Come in, please.

401
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,910
Look, it's so spacious.

402
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,270
Xiaoguang,

403
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,990
come.

404
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,870
Is this the luxury office

405
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,790
you told me about?

406
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,110
Bei...

407
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,670
I think I'm right about it.

408
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,790
Shut up.

409
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,910
Don't you think it's big?

410
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,350
Look at the state of it.

411
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,750
This old dining hall
has been abandoned for years.

412
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,430
That's right.

413
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,710
We've been cleaning it
the whole morning.

414
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,550
It's all dusty.

415
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,430
Bei, you are here.

416
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,390
Are you

417
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,990
Mr. Gu?

418
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,110
Gu Yiran.

419
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,030
How do you do?

420
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,870
The star of the police force,
Zhang Xueyao.

421
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,630
Police Firecracker.

422
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,910
Control yourself.

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,430
Let me introduce them to you.

424
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,750
Guozhu, Xiaoguang.

425
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,190
How do you do, Mr. Gu?

426
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,910
How do you do?

427
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,440
So elegant.

428
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,150
What are you doing?

429
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,310
You're Gu Yiran?

430
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,470
I thought Gu Yiran
was a grandpa-like man

431
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,230
with gray hair and a walking stick.

432
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,190
You can call me that.

433
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,790
Alright.

434
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,030
Taking advantage of me
at our first meeting, huh?

435
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,310
What are you talking about?

436
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,030
Bei.

437
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,070
Xiong.

438
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,790
You're back from the business trip.

439
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,070
You know the way here, huh?

440
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,110
I picked this place for you.

441
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,870
You're satisfied, right?

442
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,430
This is...

443
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,590
This is the professor we invited.

444
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,510
Mr. Gu.

445
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,310
How do you do?

446
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,390
Let's go.

447
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,590
The director is looking for you.

448
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,230
The drug dealer your Major Crimes
First Unit has been tracking

449
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,150
for months has finally resurfaced.

450
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,950
That guy with the last name Xie.

451
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,950
Xiong,

452
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,510
report the latest situation.

453
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,150
Yes.

454
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,430
Xie Qicheng arrived in Halan
two days ago.

455
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,790
Our guys are keeping an eye on him.

456
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,430
They've already
switched locations a few times,

457
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,470
probably carrying the goods with them.

458
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,990
They're planning to make the deal today.

459
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,990
Two hours later.

460
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,470
Two hours.

461
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,230
Alright.

462
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,910
I'll get on it. Mr. Gao.

463
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,030
Go ahead. Be careful.

464
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,670
Okay.

465
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,670
Zheng Bei.

466
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,310
Well done.

467
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,670
What do you mean?

468
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,750
I haven't set off yet.

469
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,230
I'm talking about Mr. Gu.

470
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,430
You brought him here.

471
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,430
It was a very tough job.

472
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,190
Care to put in some more effort?

473
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,830
What's wrong?

474
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,830
You said you couldn't bring him here.

475
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,150
I canceled the booking
for the guesthouse.

476
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,110
It's an awkward situation now.

477
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,110
You are really efficient in handling...

478
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,630
Alright. I'll find a solution.

479
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,350
The buyer they were supposed to meet
got arrested last night.

480
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,350
Tiegan?

481
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,070
Tiegan.

482
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,190
Good.

483
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,870
I'll go pick up the goods with him.

484
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,710
No way.

485
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,230
He resisted yesterday.

486
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,510
Damao gave him a good beating.

487
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,870
His leg's busted,
and his face is all messed up.

488
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,630
What now?

489
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,590
He can't go.

490
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,630
Beat him too hard.

491
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,550
Have the people involved in the deal
met in person?

492
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,350
No.

493
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,910
Both Tiegan and Mouse's statements
say they haven't.

494
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,750
During the transactions,

495
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,550
Mouse was the middleman
for communication.

496
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,630
Which Mouse?

497
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,430
The guy who took drugs with Tiegan
and was arrested once?

498
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,070
Right.

499
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,310
We interrogated them last night.

500
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,310
They both confessed.

501
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,270
I shouldn't go this way with you.

502
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,510
Bring Mouse out

503
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,670
and get him in the car.

504
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,870
Put it down.

505
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,710
We have been tracking
this drug dealer for six months.

506
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,590
Now there's finally movement.

507
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,790
They're making the deal today.

508
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,870
Boss Xie from Yuedong?

509
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,510
Right.

510
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,910
From Yuedong?

511
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,750
The murderer at the White Building
is also from Yuedong.

512
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,910
Both from Yuedong.

513
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,750
Are these two cases related?

514
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,670
Don't know yet.

515
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,830
If they are, we'll merge them.

516
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,990
The priority is catching them.

517
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,110
We've got two hours.

518
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,670
Today, it's undercover surveillance.

519
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,310
Everyone needs to follow along

520
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,150
and coordinate with First Unit.

521
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,230
Is this the buyer?

522
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,270
Yes. I'll replace him for the deal.

523
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,990
Guozhu,

524
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,310
get me a wiretap device.

525
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,110
Wire... Over here.

526
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,830
When we arrive,

527
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,190
Xiaoguang, Yao,

528
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,150
you two stay on the perimeter

529
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,150
and support the First Unit's operation.

530
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,510
Guozhu,

531
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,030
you're in charge of the wiretap.

532
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,230
What about me?

533
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,430
You shouldn't be involved in the arrest,

534
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,190
it wouldn't be appropriate.

535
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,950
But if you really want to go...

536
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,670
Well,

537
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,270
Guozhu, take him with you
to monitor from outside.

538
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,310
Okay.

539
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,390
Zheng Bei,

540
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,830
I thought about it.

541
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,710
The man is from Yuedong.

542
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,150
They refer to ecstasy as "pills".

543
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,710
Big buyers are called pushers.

544
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,750
The ecstasy they're dealing with
is known as "black sesame",

545
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,750
which typically causes

546
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,870
- an "out-of-body" experience.
- An "out-of-body" experience.

547
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,030
What did you say?

548
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,710
The same thing.

549
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,230
No. Say it again.

550
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,590
Out-of-body experience.

551
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,710
Out-of-body experience.

552
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,550
Out-of-body.

553
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,870
Out-of-body experience.

554
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,630
Out.

555
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,230
Out-of-body, out-of-body experience.

556
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,670
Good day, Bei.

557
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,910
Out-of-body experience.

558
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,150
You've hidden yourself quite well.

559
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,390
Tiegan and I are just
casual acquaintances.

560
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,630
Casual

561
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,550
or ecstasy?

562
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,070
I swear I've never trafficked drugs.

563
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,910
I just run errands.

564
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,190
I tell you,

565
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,910
there is only one path in front of you

566
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,990
and it might be a dead end.

567
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,310
Don't, Bei.

568
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,870
I confessed everything.

569
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,230
I didn't lie about anything.

570
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,310
They were all afraid
to show their faces,

571
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,430
so they let me be the middleman.

572
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,710
I just earned a little bit
for running errands.

573
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,550
Okay.

574
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,150
Let's see your performance later.

575
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,070
Be sharp.

576
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,710
Sure.

577
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,870
If you say anything stupid...

578
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,830
How is Boss Xie like?

579
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,550
That guy is ruthless.

580
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,390
I heard he killed people.

581
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,990
Also,

582
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,150
he is incredibly lecherous.

583
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,590
Lecherous.

584
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,630
Lecherous.

585
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,150
Bei, you like it?

586
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,310
We have more.

587
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,390
Shut up.

588
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,750
Bei.

589
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,990
No problem.

590
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,630
Where is the money?

591
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,510
Okay.

592
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,110
Guozhu.

593
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,310
Roger, Bei.

594
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,830
Let's go.

595
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:52,710
[Pattaya Resort Hotel]

596
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,090
Xie.

597
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,410
Good day, Xie.

598
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,290
Xie, this is my buddy.

599
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,210
Boss Xie,

600
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,530
we've finally met.

601
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,450
It's really not easy to see you.

602
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,690
These are your buddies, right?

603
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,530
Can you get used to the Northeast?

604
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,410
Boss Xie,

605
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,170
what surprise do you have for me?

606
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,410
Take a look.

607
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,570
It's the right taste.

608
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,770
He is smiling.

609
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,010
Love your goods.

610
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,730
Currently, in our place,

611
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,770
my business is the most thriving

612
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,890
and lucrative.

613
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,370
Do you know why?

614
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,770
Because my pills are the most genuine.

615
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,850
Right?

616
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,570
Pills.

617
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,050
Boss Tie,

618
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,370
your pronunciation is so accurate.

619
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,170
Certainly.

620
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,210
Let me tell you,

621
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,890
don't call me boss.

622
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,730
Call me Tie.

623
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,570
It feels affectionate.

624
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,370
Sure, Tie.

625
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,250
So glad I'm doing business with you.

626
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,170
Many other venues sell

627
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,010
counterfeit and inferior products

628
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,050
that just can't stand up to yours.

629
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,650
Come on.

630
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,250
Have a cigarette.

631
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,250
Wait for my signal.

632
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,370
One click.

633
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,170
They're ready to make the deal.

634
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,610
Two clicks.

635
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,610
They're about to head out.

636
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,850
Three clicks...

637
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,210
Get in there and save me, fast.

638
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,210
Okay.

639
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,410
We don't know the situation inside.

640
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,370
Take action after we come out.

641
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,290
Got it?

642
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,010
Yes.

643
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,130
Buddy, let me do it.

644
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,370
They're ready to make the deal.

645
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,130
When I do business,

646
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,810
I value quality.

647
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,210
You came in person this time.

648
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,090
I know

649
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,170
talking about money isn't fun.

650
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,730
Let's make sure we play with the best.

651
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,090
This time,

652
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,810
you've come personally.

653
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,290
This is for buying goods.

654
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,490
This is for treating
your buddies to drinks.

655
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,210
Okay?

656
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,770
Tie, you're generous.

657
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,810
Then we...

658
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,690
Litou, bring the goods here.

659
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,490
See that?

660
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,170
Professional.

661
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,610
The goods are not inside his room.

662
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,890
Pleasant cooperation this time.

663
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,290
Shall we celebrate?

664
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,530
Let's celebrate. Pour wine!

665
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,570
Don't drink so fast. It's not fun.

666
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,770
Boss Xie, what's going on?

667
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,130
You don't know the rules here.

668
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,930
We don't touch women

669
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,370
before doing business.

670
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,770
That's bad luck.

671
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,610
Go out.

672
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,250
Do in Rome as the Romans do.

673
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,210
You are doing
such a big business in Yuedong.

674
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,410
When you came
to the Northeast this time,

675
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,010
didn't you bring anything
for self-defense?

676
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,610
Two tubes.

677
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,570
Two what?

678
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,850
Well...

679
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,330
My God, such a powerful weapon.

680
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,010
Right, hand grenades.

681
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,490
Where did you put them?

682
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,170
Let me take a look.

683
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,530
I love these things.

684
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,490
Oh my God.

685
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,930
It's behind me.

686
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,930
My goodness. Scary.

687
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,770
It's real.

688
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,450
Be careful.

689
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,490
Be careful.

690
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,890
I won't pull. Let me take a look.

691
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,010
It's really good.

692
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,250
Boss Xie, please sell it to me.

693
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,250
I love this.

694
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,170
Tie, don't say "sell".

695
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,290
I'll give you one.

696
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,850
No way.

697
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,370
I must pay for it.

698
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,930
Otherwise, I'm afraid it won't explode.

699
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,530
Attention.

700
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,690
They have a hand grenade.

701
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,490
Be careful.

702
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,010
Really? A hand grenade?

703
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,930
You're back.

704
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,010
Come on.

705
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,050
There is another one.

706
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,370
Mouse, check the goods.

707
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,450
Sell this to me, too.

708
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,290
We travel in shadows
and will need it for protection.

709
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,170
I can't sell this one.

710
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,490
Alright.

711
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,410
I'll put it in the box for you.

712
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,050
How are the goods?

713
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,970
No problem.

714
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,890
Good.

715
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,010
Boss Xie, take the money.

716
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,570
Pleasant doing business with you.

717
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,290
Let me introduce you
to the Northeastern bathhouse culture.

718
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,170
It's an experience you won't forget.

719
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,570
Take this pill.

720
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,570
You'll feel incredible.

721
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,370
No. You take one.

722
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,130
I took one this morning.
Still feeling strong.

723
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,730
Out-of-body experience.

724
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,610
