6
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
Look, I got the timing just right.

7
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,320
- Uncle.
- Hurry up and eat breakfast.

8
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

9
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,640
You're a lifesaver.

10
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm starving.

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Sit down.

12
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
You've all worked hard.

13
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,880
Why are there only the three of you?
Where are the other two?

14
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,200
They're at the hospital.

15
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
At the hospital?

16
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,360
What happened? Who is injured?

17
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
Mr. Gu got hurt too?

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,480
He didn't make it.

19
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,240
What?

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
It's nothing.

21
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,040
Just a scrape, don't worry.

22
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
You little rascal.

23
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,720
A scrape and he's in the hospital?

24
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
And someone has to stay
to take care of him?

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
Speak clearly. How serious is it?

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,320
Really, it's nothing.

27
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
Just got hit by a brick.

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,000
Then got whacked.

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
And then got hit with a hammer.

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,560
Might even get hit
with a big iron ladle.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,040
I'll hit you with a big iron ladle!

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
Speak properly. How are they really?

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,880
- It's nothing. Just eat.
- It's nothing.

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
- I'm exhausted.
- It's really nothing, Uncle.

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,320
You never take anything seriously.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Uncle, you're having noodles?

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
You arrived at the perfect time.

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
Xiong, you followed the smell,
didn't you?

39
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,040
Come, Xiong, come on.

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,840
Just the right time.

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
How did it go on your end?

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,960
Finished the interrogation.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
What's the result?

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
The guy immediately ratted you out.

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
He said

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,440
you're a major pusher

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
with lots of goods,

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
offering a 10% discount.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He recognized him perfectly.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Hurry up and eat.

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000
After you're done,
go back and finish the interrogation.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
Take him away.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
I guarantee to complete
this glorious task.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
Anything else?

55
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,160
We've confirmed it.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
This is what they call Lucifer.

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Where did the goods come from?

58
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
I asked him for a long time,
but he couldn't tell.

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,880
He probably really doesn't know.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
All he knows is
that it's in the Blue Aurora.

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,120
But

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,560
it only comes out when the big bosses

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,640
are hosting.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
This guy doesn't have access to it.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Xiong, you hurry up.

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,360
- Eat and talk at the same time.
- Alright.

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
Or it'll all get soggy.

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,120
Alright.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
This guy

70
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,640
is just a small-time pusher,
selling only Red Dragon.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
At best, he's a middleman.

72
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,320
The goods come from above.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
He only heard the name
Lucifer from others.

74
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,800
He gave me

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,520
accurate information about a warehouse.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Where is it?

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,640
Where's the map?

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Sanlianer Factory?

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
Sanlianer?

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You all know about it?

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Yeah, that's the place
where they store Red Dragon.

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
Didn't we already discover it
during the taxi checks?

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,760
We've got people watching it.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
But didn't you get
any useful information

85
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
after all that questioning?

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,160
The statements are all in here.

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
Finish eating first.

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
Afterward, take a good look at it.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
If you have any questions,

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,720
I'll pull him out

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
and interrogate him again.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
You're so slow, not doing anything
properly all day.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Honestly, though,

94
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,400
the food you guys have
in the special task force

95
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,560
is really tasty.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Uncle's cooking is excellent.

97
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
But you don't have to make that sound.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,640
Eat more.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
Eat more.

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,280
There's plenty.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Oh right, this guy gave me a name,

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
also something he heard
from the underworld.

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,200
He said this guy is the mastermind
behind the Lucifer deals.

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,400
What's his name?

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
It's a nickname.

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,200
They call him Mr. Ma.

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
Mr. Ma.

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh, God.

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,400
So, what do you think we should do?

110
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
You're asking me what to do?

111
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,880
You got yourself into this mess,
so you figure it out.

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,520
Stop giving me trouble.

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,920
Welcome.

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,840
Madam.

115
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,280
Long time no see.

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
Welcome.

117
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,480
You handled things pretty quickly, huh?

118
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Where did the fight happen?

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Don't worry, Madam.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll make sure

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,320
to give you a perfect...

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm asking you,

123
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
where did the fight happen?

124
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,200
Madam,

125
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
have some water.

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Sorry for the lack of hospitality.

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Where are they?

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
They're all outside.

129
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,560
Bring them in.

130
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Madam,

131
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,800
this...

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,520
You guys.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,560
Wang's glasses temple broke,

134
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
but the lenses are fine.

135
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,240
I found an identical one.

136
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
See if that's okay.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,480
Line up. Stand properly.

138
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,960
These guys

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,920
were just recently transferred in.

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
They don't know the rules.

141
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,800
They really didn't mean to offend you.

142
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Did they offend me?

143
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
They offended Wang.

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,120
If I had known

145
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
Wang was involved last night,

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
I would have handled it personally.

147
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,480
I wouldn't have let Wang
suffer like that, right?

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Madam, this is just a small token
of my respect.

149
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
Do I need your money?

150
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,240
How about this?

151
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll personally visit Wang

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,880
another day to apologize.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,960
No need.

154
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
Wang is a clean man.

155
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't drag him into this mess.

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
Madam, what do you want

157
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
if you were in that situation?

158
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
Who was the one
who started the fight last night?

159
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
Sen.

160
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,640
Erjin.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
Were you blind?

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,280
Do you know who you've offended?

163
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,840
Boss, but they were the ones who...

164
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,920
Still talking?

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
Enough. Who are you putting on
this show for?

166
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
Madam,

167
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,760
this kid doesn't know any better.

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
I'll straighten him out for you.

169
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,680
Is that how you plan to handle it?

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,360
My Wang is lying
in the hospital right now.

171
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,160
His whole body is bruised.

172
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
He can hardly eat.

173
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,160
And this guy is standing here
without a scratch.

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Do you think that's fair?

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,680
Madam,

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
what do you mean?

177
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,020
What the hell?

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Did I tell you to do it?

179
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
Erjin.

180
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,560
Yes.

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Wang doesn't know you,

182
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
but you know him, right?

183
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes.

184
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,800
You know what kind of person he is,
don't you?

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
I've never seen anyone

186
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
more honest and decent than him.

187
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,160
No matter what happened last night,

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,800
he wasn't the one causing trouble.

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
That's right.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,680
I know Wang is a clean guy.

191
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
If it wasn't for business,

192
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,400
he wouldn't have come
to a place like ours.

193
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
Good that you know.

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
You run a business, a club.

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,600
How you settle things is your business,

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
not mine.

197
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,040
But if you mess with my man,

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,480
I need an explanation, don't I?

199
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,720
Absolutely.

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
Madam,

201
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
please calm down.

202
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Sen is

203
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,120
under my boss' protection.

204
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,520
He's just recently arrived
and doesn't know the rules.

205
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
That should be...

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Are you trying

207
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
to intimidate me with Qin Yi?

208
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,200
No, Madam.

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
I didn't mean that.

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
When I married Wang,

211
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,880
I informed the underground.

212
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Qin Yi knows that too.

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,680
Yes.

214
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,240
I've done him a favor

215
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
by not confronting him directly today.

216
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
If I really get angry,

217
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,480
he can forget
about running the Blue Aurora.

218
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't think I don't know

219
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
what you did to Mu.

220
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Is Jin Fei in her second year
of college this year?

221
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Her grades are good, right?

222
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,160
You're managing the club
and the taxi fleet.

223
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
Are you able to handle it all?

224
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,920
It's going okay.

225
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Well, Madam.

226
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,440
That...

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,680
That pearl necklace you gave to Fei,

228
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,320
she really treasures it.

229
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
She's reluctant to take it off.

230
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
That's good to hear.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let me tell you,

232
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,720
Jin Fei is a smart kid.

233
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,200
As long as she studies hard,

234
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,920
she'll definitely succeed in the future.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,960
She mustn't get involved

236
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
in these messy matters.

237
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,160
Don't worry. I'll make sure
she stays away from such things.

238
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Why are you still beating him?

239
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
That's enough.

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,880
Alright.

241
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,320
I really can't chat any longer today.

242
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,560
My Mao is still at home waiting for me

243
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
and I need to go home and cook for her.

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm leaving.

245
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
Alright.

246
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Madam, about the money...

247
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I appreciate the gesture.

248
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
Keep it for medical expenses.

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
Thank you, Madam.

250
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,600
What are you looking at?

251
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,840
Hurry up and send him to the hospital.

252
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
Who's that woman?

253
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,200
She's ruthless.

254
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Have you heard of Song the Slicer?

255
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
Is that her?

256
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
It's been years.

257
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,480
Is she still that formidable?

258
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,200
Alright.

259
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,640
Stop gossiping.

260
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
Bro.

261
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,880
I just heard her mention Fei.

262
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,120
She was threatening you
with those words.

263
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
Take me home first.

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,640
Later,

265
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,120
go to the hospital
and pick up Wang's medicine.

266
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
Okay.

267
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,280
[Mr. Ma?]

268
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
It seems now

269
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,840
that Qin Yi

270
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,440
is very likely
the Mr. Ma they mentioned.

271
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,080
That mild?

272
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,280
Why not Ma the Executioner?

273
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
If he were called Gedmis,

274
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,520
I'd be sure he's this old drug lord.

275
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Don't digress.

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
We still need to investigate.

277
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
So far, we know

278
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,760
that Qin Yi's taxi company

279
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,280
is used for drug transportation.

280
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,560
The Sanlianer Factory is the warehouse.

281
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
Erjin, who manages the taxis,

282
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,040
happens to be his subordinate.

283
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,400
That's quite a solid chain of evidence.

284
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Could the Lucifer we found yesterday

285
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,000
be the meth
from the White Building case?

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,920
I don't know.

287
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,280
We'll have to wait for Mr. Gu
to come back and do the test.

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,160
Well, Bro.

289
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,800
We already know their activities.

290
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Why don't we just arrest them?

291
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
Let me say it again.

292
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,160
To catch drug dealers,
you must catch them red-handed.

293
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Otherwise, you can't charge them
with drug trafficking.

294
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,440
You can't just say you know
they're dealing drugs

295
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,480
and use that as evidence.

296
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,840
In simple terms, four words,

297
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,640
"people and evidence together."

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
Got it.

299
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,280
Guozhu,

300
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,280
you should catch up on your sleep.

301
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
This afternoon, take your camera

302
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,280
and check out the Sanlianer Factory.

303
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
Take some pictures.

304
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,160
Bei, I've never been
to the Sanlianer Factory.

305
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,360
Why don't you let Yao go with me?

306
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,040
If I'm by myself...

307
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
You're a grown man.

308
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,600
What's there to be afraid of
when taking a few photos?

309
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,080
Alright.

310
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,280
I'll go investigate Erjin's situation.

311
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,320
Yao, you go to the hospital

312
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,400
and switch out with Mr. Gu.

313
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,560
Have him hurry up with the tests.

314
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,160
Please, no. I don't want to
take care of Xiaoguang.

315
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,480
How about I investigate Erjin instead?

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,920
I've noticed you're all
getting more and more picky,

317
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,640
not wanting to do anything.

318
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
Fine. You investigate Erjin.

319
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,240
I'll go to the hospital.

320
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,520
Alright.

321
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I'll head to the hospital.

322
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,480
Be careful, Uncle.

323
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Don't trip.
You're always a bit careless.

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
How could I trip?

325
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Don't you have a car?

326
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,080
You can drive me there.

327
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Alright, I'll take you.

328
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,480
[Summer 1994]

329
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Li Wenlong!

330
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,020
Open the door!

331
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,060
Open the door!

332
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,500
Open the door!

333
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,180
Open up!

335
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,580
You've got the medicine?

336
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,380
Mr. Gu.

337
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,660
Uncle, you're here.

338
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,620
Let's go upstairs.

339
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,980
Tell me the truth,

340
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,500
how's Xiaoguang's condition?

341
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,620
He's fine. Just some scrapes.

342
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,140
This is just some scrapes?

343
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,060
This is what you call scrapes?

344
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,180
This is what you call scrapes?

345
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,540
What's wrong with you all?

346
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,220
Do you think this is a market?

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,700
a simple concussion.

349
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,140
It's the mildest form
of closed head injury.

350

His leg

353

has a slight muscle tear.

354
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
It's not a big problem.

355
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,020
Nothing serious.

356
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,140
Just rest quietly and he'll be fine.

357
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,220
Rest quietly!

358
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,020
Yes.

359
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,820
Now, that's what you call
just some scrapes.

360
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,780
Right.

361
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,620
Sorry about that.

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
It's not a big deal.

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,220
Why is she so angry?

364
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,660
What's wrong
with being told off a little?

365
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,420
You're not supposed to be
making noise here.

366
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,540
Look at how you were acting.

why did I ask you to come here?

You're supposed to be taking care
of the patient,

but here you are,

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,020
stuffing your mouth.

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,140
I peeled one for him too.
He just ate it.

375
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,260
I just ate a couple of cloves.

376
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,420
She was peeling them for herself,

377
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,140
but she couldn't eat them up.
So she left you two cloves.

378
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,820
Look at that girl,

379
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,020
running back and forth

380
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,860
taking care of the patient.

381
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,220
Gu.

382
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,900
Who would act like you?

383
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,180
Gu, eat up.

384
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,260
Those are wives visiting their husbands.

385
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
I'm just here for my neighbor.

386
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,940
That's different.

387
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,180
Wait,

388
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,340
I'm just a neighbor now?

389
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,660
You're not a neighbor.

390
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,780
You're just a buddy.

391
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,740
Alright.

392
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,420
Enough.

393
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,260
What are you up to?

394
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Alright,

395
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,020
Zheng Nan,

396
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,300
you never take things seriously.

397
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,540
If you're tired, grab a few bites,

398
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,700
and then we'll head back.

399
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,260
How can you not be tired
after working all night?

400
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,580
Eat quickly so you can leave.

401
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,700
I'll keep watch here.

402
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,100
Uncle, you should leave
once you're done eating too.

403
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,940
If I leave, who will take care of you?

404
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,500
Isn't she here?

405
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,100
She used to chase me around
and beat me up when I was a kid.

406
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,060
Now I finally get a chance

407
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,660
to make her take care of me.

408
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,380
She's so lazy.

409
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,820
I need to give her a chance
to correct her ways

410
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,420
and be productive.

411
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,860
Nan.

412
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,780
You started eating by yourself?

413
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,340
You're supposed to be
taking care of the patient.

414
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,660
You're just eating by yourself?

415
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,020
Give him something to eat.

416
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,420
Meat.

417
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,180
Did I forget about you? Here.

418
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,140
What are you doing?

419
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,180
You might as well stab him to death.

420
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,580
You've almost got the chopsticks
at the back of his head.

421
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
Sorry.

422
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,860
My bad.

423
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,300
Eat quickly and get out of here.

424
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,740
The nurse has quite a temper.

425
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,340
Xiaoguang,

426
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,860
if you like
being taken care of like this,

427
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,340
I'll leave her here.

428
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,740
You take good care of him.

429
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,100
I'll take Uncle away.

430
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,420
If you insist, I guess I could manage.

431
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,900
Give me a bite of that dish.

432
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,740
That dish.

433
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,560
[Halan's Old Brand:
State-owned Cold Noodle Restaurant]

434
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,060
Do you need me to open it for you?

435
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,020
Yes.

436
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,820
Your cold noodles are really good.

437
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,660
Of course,

438
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,900
we're an old brand.

439
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,940
We have a lot of regular customers.

440
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,620
Really?

441
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,860
A friend recommended this place to me.

442
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,300
Not sure if you remember him.

443
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,100
He's from the south,

444
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,540
has asthma,

445
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,820
and often carries an inhaler.

446
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,500
I remember.

447
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,020
Is he a short guy

448
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,100
with dark skin?

449
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,020
Yes.

450
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,420
He's one of our regular customers too.

451
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
He came by for noodles
every now and then.

452
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,580
Thank you.

453
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,940
No problem.
Call me if you need anything.

454
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,660
Alright.

455
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,220
Time to work.

456
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,340
What's the matter?

457
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,180
You're sweating like crazy. Bad dream?

458
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,140
It's been hot lately.

459
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,140
I forgot to set my alarm last night.

460
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
You're even using local slang now?
Impressive.

461
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,220
When in Rome, right?

462
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,300
Normally,

463
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,940
you'd be running
to North Yangliu Lane by now,

464
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,420
wouldn't you?

465
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,500
Want to go together today?

466
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
I don't feel like running.

467
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,380
Have some exercise.

468
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,420
Let's go.

469
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Mom,

470
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,220
what happened to him?

471
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
Daddy

472
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,780
had a big fall.

473
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,860
He turned himself into a panda.

474
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,020
So, should we

475
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,700
feed him carrots later?

476
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
Only rabbits eat carrots.

477
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Pandas eat bamboo.

478
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,580
As I've told you many times,

479
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,820
stop calling him "he."

480
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,180
Call him "Dad," okay?

481
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,700
He's not my dad.

482
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
The results are out.

483
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,660
How is it?

484
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,620
The same?

485
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Exactly the same.

486
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,620
That's great.

487
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,460
Yao.

488
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,780
Get Director Gao for me.

489
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,340
Got it.

490
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,140
On it.

491
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,380
By the way,

492
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,460
how's Xiaoguang?

493
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,060
Xiaoguang's fine.

494
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,020
Just some scrapes.

495
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,780
Keep going.

496
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,780
We have a major discovery this time.

497
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,700
The meth from the White Building

498
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,180
and the meth from Blue Aurora

499
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,860
have been tested and compared,

500
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,140
and they have the same purity.

501
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,220
This proves that this meth

502
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,420
isn't just appearing in Halan randomly.

503
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,060
It's being sold in an organized manner.

504
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,500
Additionally, we've identified

505
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,300
the name of this meth.

506
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,380
It's called Lucifer.

507
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,740
The person controlling Lucifer

508
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,900
is known only by a codename,

509
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,420
"Mr. Ma."

510
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,220
Is Mr. Ma this Qin Yi?

511
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,100
We can't confirm that yet.

512
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,100
Where's the warehouse?

513
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,740
We've had people monitoring
the Sanlianer Factory,

514
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
but so far,

515
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,980
we haven't obtained
any conclusive evidence.

516
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,500
Do you have enough manpower?

517
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,520
I...

518
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,340
♪Though the ice doesn't freeze♪

519
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,180
♪It feels like countless voices
are speaking♪

520
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,220

521
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,420
Uncle!

522
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,900
Why are you back?

523
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,340
I'm almost recovered.

524
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,340
What did the doctor...

525
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,180
Director Gao?

526
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,220
Were you...

527
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,940
Having a meeting?

528
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,460
Did the doctor tell you to come back?

529
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,340
Uncle, don't worry about it.

530
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,860
Zheng Bei,

531
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,100
is this what you call a scrape?

532
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,500
Xiaoguang, why aren't you
staying in the hospital?

533
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,380
Director Gao,

534
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,140
the doctor said it's nothing serious.

535
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,180
The bandages just look a bit scary.

536
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,700
Stop showing off.

537
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,100
Go home and rest.

538
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,820
Director Gao,

539
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,980
the doctor said

540
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,860
rest is all I need.

541
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,900
Whether I'm in the hospital or at work,

542
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,420
I'm just sitting around.

543
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,780
With my skills,

544
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,540
I can contribute to the team.

545
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,500
At the very least,

546
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,180
I can help review case files.

547
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,620
You rascal.

548
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,860
Zheng Bei,

549
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,100
why didn't you inform me

550
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,380
that his injuries were this severe?

551
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,060
I figured

552
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,420
even if I told you,

553
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,220
there wasn't much you could do.

554
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,980
No need to worry about the leadership.

555
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,780
Exactly.

556
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,900
Besides, the hospital is so boring.

557
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,620
The ward at night is filled
with all sorts of noises,

558
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,380
like wolves howling.

559
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,860
It was like...

560
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,140
Enough already.

561
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,460
Stop the nonsense.

562
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,380
Zheng Bei,

563
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,660
do as you said.

564
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,260
We must locate the drug stash.

565
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,620
And remember,

566
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,460
be meticulous.

567
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,060
Be thorough.

568
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,900
Understood.

569
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

570
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,500
- Director Gao, see you.
- Take care.

571
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Thank you, Director Gao,
for your concern.

572
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,780
How are you feeling now?

573
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,780
I'm fine.

574
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Moving around easily.

575
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,300
Why insist on coming back
from the hospital?

576
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,740
I just thought I could help out.

577
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,420
Now that you're back,

578
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,100
spend the next couple of days
playing chess with Uncle.

579
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,860
Fine.

580
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,300
You agreed, but I won't.

581
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,540
Every time I play with him,

582
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,300
I end up with my general in my pocket.

583
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,140
Even Uncle doesn't like
playing with you.

584
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,460
Where's my sister?

585
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,380
Your sister

586
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,380
is something else.

587
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,180
I thought if she took care of me
for a few more days,

588
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,500
she'd finish me off.

589
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,620
So I rushed back to contribute.

590
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,620
Okay.

591
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,060
It's good to be motivated.

592
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,340
I'll find something for you to do,

593
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,020
so you can be comfortable

594
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,620
and make contributions as well.

595
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,400
[Sanlianer Factory]

596
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,060
Guozhu.

597
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,660
Are you out of your mind?

598

[REC]

599
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,060
Xiaoguang.

600
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,300
Look at those two people over there.

601
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,540
They're scavengers.

602
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,300
Scavengers?

603
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,900
Can you be more precise?

604
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,820
Strictly speaking,
that's called stealing,

605
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,420
not scavenging.

606
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,340
And you've recorded it, haven't you?

607
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,900
We've been here for ten days

608
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
and only filmed three things.

609
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,220
The scavengers

610
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,540
and two drunks.

611
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,740
But no deliveries.

612
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,980
How's your head?

613
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,900
Still hurting?

614
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,140
My head is fine.

615
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,860
It's just...

616
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,860
Your butt hurts, right?

617
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,020
My butt hurts too.

618
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,140
Feels like it's about to fall apart.

619
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,620
Is that Bei?

620
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,420
Do we have new leads?

621
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,380
It's Nan.

622
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,660
She sent a message to check in on me.

623
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,180
Look at you,

624
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,340
you can't even keep a straight face.

625
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,980
Bei told us to go back.

626
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,940
We're not keeping watch anymore?

627
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,140
The current order is for us to return.

628
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,220
How can we keep watching?

629
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,700
What's up with you two?

630
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,660
Why the long faces?

631
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,100
Where's Bei?

632
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,740
Bei's getting scolded right now.

633
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,820
Why?

634
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,940
The lead went cold.

635
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,740
Which lead?

636
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,820
Sanlianer Factory.

637
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,380
Weren't Zhu and I just keeping watch?

638
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,180
So why call us back so early?

639
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,620
What if we catch something today?

640
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,940
Let's go, Zhu. Let's go back
and continue watching.

641
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,420
We can't afford to miss anything.

642
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
Stop right there.

643
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,460
Come back!

644
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,020
Bro.

645
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,220
Let us go back and continue watching.

646
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,460
We can't lose this lead.

647
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,900
I promise I'll keep a close eye on it.

648
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
It's been ten days.

649
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,340
The drugs on the market
haven't decreased at all.

650
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,060
Sanlianer Factory hasn't
made a single delivery.

651
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,820
What does that tell us?

652
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,860
Did you guys miss something?

653
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,460
We've been undercover
in several places these past few days,

654
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,740
and the drugs are still circulating.

655
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,180
What does that tell us?

656
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,900
It tells us we've been watching
the wrong place.

657
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,000
To be precise, the location has changed.

658
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,400
What about Mouse?

659
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,760
Has he said anything?

660
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,720
It's possible that Qin Yi was used

661
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,920
to changing the storage location
periodically,

662
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,800
or maybe our previous surveillance

663
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
was noticed.

664
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,480
But whatever the reason,

665
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,440
Sanlianer Factory

666
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,440
