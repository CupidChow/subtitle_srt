00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,880
I heard there's a new spot
near Beishan Park.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,440
Take me to check it out tonight.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,440
Stop taking advantage of me.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,680
You're paying for the meal, right?

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,360
I'll pay.

this one is on me.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Just pay for everything
if you're so capable.

11

Why don't you pay my bill?

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,720
"I'll pay."

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,440
Why is he so noisy?

14

What were you muttering?

16

No, I wasn't talking about you.

Look at him, he's pretty handsome, huh?

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,960
Doesn't he look like a potato?

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,560
- Just kidding.
- Dude.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,600
I said you look like a potato.

- Just kidding. What are you doing?
- Dude.

23

He's just a drunkard.

Sit down.

Just a drunkard. Ignore him.

27
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,520
He has a good temper, doesn't he?

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,280
Yeah.

You're joking with me.

33

I've already recognized you.

Your memory is terrible.

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Back then,

you, me, and our big brother,

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
the three of us swore brotherhood,
remember?

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,680
Your mind's gone, huh?

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,160
Back then, we swore brotherhood,

42
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,200
and we became buddies.

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,760
Then one day, he got so worked up,

44
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,840
he banged his head on the bathroom wall

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,920
and broke it.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
We scraped together money

47
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,320
to send him to the hospital.

48
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,480

what happened to him.

According to their rules,

he should've destroyed it,

what happened to the old scavenger.

So, he didn't rat out the higher-ups,
did he?

I'm just a low-level lackey.

It was left outside my door
late at night.

142
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,880
Your higher-ups are pretty bold.

That one towel can produce so much meth.

144
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,640
They just left at your doorstep?

145
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
Weren't they worried
someone might take it?

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,920
How would I know
what they were thinking?

147

How about this?

152
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,960
I'll give you a hint.

153
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
Because you carelessly discarded

154

You're the one asking now?

162
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,600
That's meth.

163
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
That's why he died.

164
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Impossible.

00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,440
Don't say it's impossible.

166

Otherwise, how did we find you?

167
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,280

No need to worry
about your higher-ups now.

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
If he takes this opportunity,

176
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
he might even get released early

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,760
and start over.

178
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,880
Release? No way.

179
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,120

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,920
I'll die even faster.

191
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
You're here now.

192
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,960
No need to worry about the outside.

193
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
Spit it out while you still can.

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
At least we can protect you.

195
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Fine, I'll confess.

196
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
Every time, we get the goods

197
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,480
at the Wanhuang Hotel parking lot.

198
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400
When the truck arrives,

199
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,920
Bai is in charge of distribution.

200
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,400
There are always over a dozen cars
waiting for the goods.

201
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,040
We can't say a word the whole time.

202
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
Once we get the stuff,

203
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,560
we leave.

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,760
Big trucks bring it in,

205
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
small cars take it out?

206
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,920
Yes.

207
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,360
What else?

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,840
One time, I had an upset stomach,

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
so I took a bathroom break.

210
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,520
When I came back,

211
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,080
I noticed
there were two trucks with towels.

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,000
One was near the parking lot exit,

213
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
for distribution.

214
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
The other was parked
by the hotel elevator.

215
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,520
I guess

216
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
there must have a pusher at the hotel.

217
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Wait.

218
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
If both trucks

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,480
were carrying tainted towels,

220
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,240
one for the pushers,

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
the other for the hotel,

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
then Xiaoguang couldn't have missed it.

223
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,920
They would have caught them.

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,800
That means the towels
going into the hotel were clean.

225
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,760
So they mixed the clean towels

226
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,720
with the tainted ones

227
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,400
to avoid suspicion.

228
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,760
So if

229
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,120
the towel I seized
was from the other truck,

230
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
we would've missed the mark?

231
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,080
Wait, I have a question.

232
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,840
The towels were clean
when they left the factory,

233
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,120
but they became tainted

234
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,400
after being loaded onto the truck.

235
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
How did they do that?

236
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,680
I think

237
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
the towels are processed
into tainted ones

238
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,080
at a secret location
during transportation.

239
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
After that,

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
they're sent out.

241
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
But there are hundreds of kilometers

242
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,520
between the towel factory

243
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
and Wanhuang Hotel in Sheng City.

244
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,920
They could have stopped anywhere
along the way.

245
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,280
How can we search?

246
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
Here's the plan.

247
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Next time they transport the towels,

248
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,640
we'll tail them from the factory

249
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,640
and keep a close eye on them
the whole way.

250
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
See what they can do then.

251
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,480
By the way,
the towel factory just informed us

252
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
that Wanhuang Hotel's next order

253
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,440
will be in just over half a month.

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
But if we wait half a month to act,

255
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
surely

256
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,800
we can catch

257
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
the middle and lower members

258
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
and dismantle the transport route.

259
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,800
It'll be hard

260
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,440
to find the real meth factory.

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
And if we don't act,

262
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,160
a new batch of tainted towels
will hit the market,

263
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,560
putting more lives

264
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,160
at risk of drugs.

265
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
Okay.

266
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,200
We'll hold out for half a month,

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,640
gather every clue,

268
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,120
find the meth factory,

269
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,680
and eliminate them in one go.

270
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,560
Got it!

271
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
Where are we heading?

272
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,680
Wujia Village's urban village.

273
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
According to our intelligence,

274
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,840
Bai Ling has been in frequent contact
with two chemical plants.

275
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
They must be

276
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
their new suppliers.

277
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
I remember clearly,

278
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
those two plants are northeast of here.

279
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,160
Yes.

280
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
So I think their meth lab

281
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,920
is likely in that area too,

282
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,960
not too far away.

283
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,040
If they had to transport the goods

284
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
through the city every time,

285
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,040
that'd be too risky.

286
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
Exactly.

287
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
Meth production releases a lot of toxic,

288
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,360
pungent gases.

289
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
Their output is so large,

290
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
they wouldn't choose an urban location.

291
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,040
It'd be too easy to get caught.

292
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,640
I remember the northeast outskirts

293
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
have an old industrial zone,

294
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,840
with a dozen factories all connected.

295
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,640
Plastic, feed and everything.

296
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
The smell is awful.

297
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,400
If they're hiding there,

298
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,640
it'd be hard to detect.

299
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,520
There are two more places.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,640
One is this

301
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,600
Wujia Village urban area
we're heading to now,

302
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,920
and the other
is the old Nangang district.

303
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,760
Both are sparsely populated
and reek of chemicals.

304
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,520
Bei, this place is perfect.

305
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,320
It's got everything.

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
Anyone want an ice pop?

307
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,400
We're here to work.

308
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,640
Can you take this seriously?

309
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,480
What do you know?

310
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,040
This is what I call blending in.

311
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm telling you,

312
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,760
we're already in dangerous territory.

313
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,520
We need to blend in properly.

314
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,080
Look at all these

315
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
suspicious people.

316
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,280
What are you thinking?

317
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm telling you,

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,840
don't be biased. Got it?

319
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,880
Got it.

320
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,240
If the meth lab is nearby,

321
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,120
they'd likely hire local workers.

322
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,360
It's cheaper and keeps a low profile.

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
So, every person we see

324
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
could be part of the operation.

325
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
See? Ran agrees with me.

326
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,960
Are you two
talking about the same thing?

327
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Let's split up.

328
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Be careful not to blow our cover.

329
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,040
We'll regroup at this noodle shop later.

330
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,100
[Car Repair]

331
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Fried noodles.

332
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,160
Enjoy your meal.

333
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,800
Thanks.

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,600
Want one?

335
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,800
What's up, Ran?

336
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,840
Have no appetite?

337
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,440
Are you missing Uncle?

338
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,440
Didn't you say this place was great?

339
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
And said it's much better
than Uncle's food.

340
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,960
That's what Bei said.

341
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,840
Hurry up and eat.

342
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,520
Afterward,
we'll head to Nangang for a look.

343
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,960
Vinegar?

344
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,000
No, thanks.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,720
No?

346
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
That's such a waste.

347
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
She dumped the whole bowl of noodles.

348
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
Waste is bad.

349
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,280
Hurry up and eat.

350
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
If you don't eat, that's also wasteful.

351
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
If you can eat, eat it.

352
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
If you're too full,
forcing it down is also wasteful.

353
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,800
I've got an idea.

354
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,800
I know how to find them.

355
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,120
[Sewers]

356
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,160
The city's sewage system is complex,

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,160
but it always traces back to its source.

358
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
So if we trace

359
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,000
the contaminated wastewater,

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,040
we can find their location.

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
They have to dispose

362
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,440
of the chemicals and wastewater
from producing meth.

363
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,520
But they can't dump it anywhere.

364
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,600
They can't release it into the river

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,680
or out in the open.

366
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,520
The smell would give them away.

367
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,280
Right. So if we narrow it down

368
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,400
to the northeastern sector,

369
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,560
once we find which area's sewers

370
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,920
have toxic levels off the charts,

371
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
we can zero in.

372
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,440
Ran,

373
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,600
this is much faster

374
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
than wandering around.

375
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,200
What's wrong?

376
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,240

No need to go that far, Yao.

380
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
We'll get the sanitation department

381
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,320
to help.

382
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,200
Every district has dedicated trucks.

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
Sewage trucks?

384
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Slow down,

385
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,360
you might spill it.

386
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,320
It won't spill.

387
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360

392
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,120

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,920
Uncle didn't make you guys lunch?

394
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
Here's a suggestion.

395
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,320

397
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Close what?

398
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560

399
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,240
Anyway, I warned you.

400
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,680
What does he mean?

401
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,000
He must be angry

402
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,960
because Uncle didn't make him lunch.

403
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
Hey, my mask fell off.

404
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,960
Can someone pull it up for me?

405
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480

Gazi Lake Chemical Plant.

413
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
For years, they've been dumping waste

414
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,040
into Gazi Lake and the drainage ditches
of the urban village.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,920
They have been fined

416
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,120
countless times, but still won't stop.

417
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,440
In the end,
they were forced to shut down.

418
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,040
It's been vacant
for more than three years now.

419
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
This factory

420
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,400
isn't exactly in the urban village.

421
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,160
Yes.

422
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
But the drainage ditch

423
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
runs right by it.

424
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,040
The plant used to pollute the village,

425
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,240
and several villagers even died

426
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
because of that.

427
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
After the shutdown, it was empty.

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,560
Who would've thought

429
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
they'd use it to make drugs?

430
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,280
That is why

431

Now, we've locked down

440
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
there's got to be a ledger, right?

441
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Lin Zhida,

442
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,720
he started out as a petty thief.

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,240
When it comes to money,

444
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,760
he's meticulous, counts every cent.

445
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,320
I looked into it before.

446
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,600
Most of Lin Zhida's contacts

447
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,760
are clients.

448
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,560
All his business dealings
happen at his hotel.

449
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,600
Although he owns three properties,

450
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,960
he rarely goes home.

451
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,840
The office on the top floor
of Wanhuang Hotel

452
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
is where he spends most of his time.

453
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,920
So, our last step

454
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,400
is to break into Lin Zhida's office

455
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,320
to find the ledger,

456
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,200
and connect all the dots.

457
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
You think you can connect them?

458
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,440
Shouldn't be too hard.

459
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Not hard?

460
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
You think barging in is easy?

461
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,640
Why not just announce yourself?

without causing trouble?

I'm telling you,

and let anyone slip away.

to check out the chemical plant,
