Over here, Nan.

Let me see.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,280
Don't take them all.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,680
Leave a few to me.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,240
Alright.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,320
Give me a couple.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,280
The ones at the back.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,880
Here.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Look, Bei.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,560
These are almost identical.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,880
Each one cost a few jiao.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,680
Isn't that wasteful?

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,520
What's the big deal?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
Well...

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,120
Bei, when did you take this photo?

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,320
What photo?

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Welcome.

22
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Long,

23
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,520
you're being too formal.

24
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
No need to greet me here.

25
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,560
What's wrong?

26
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,160
Mr. Ma has his rules.

27
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,880
He doesn't meet with just anyone.

28
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,320
Right, it's good to have rules.

29
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Wait in the cars.

30
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes, sir!

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Shall we go?

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin,

33
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,520
but I need to do a pat-down.

34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Seriously?

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,960
Go ahead.

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,320
- Let's go.
- Are you done?

37
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
Madam,

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
we should've met at my hotel.

39
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,840
We could talk while eating

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
and even have some noodle soup, right?

41
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
But in here...

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
And where is Mr. Ma?

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
He called the meeting,

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
and he's not even here?

45
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
What's his game?

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,440
Trying to intimidate me?

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,040
If you don't want to wait,

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
you can leave right now.

Mr. Ma.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Nice to meet you.

52
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm Lin Zhida.

53
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,760
Hello, I'm Liang Jiaju.

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
This is my son, Lin Jiang.

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,680
I didn't expect you to be so young.

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,640
Thanks, Zi,

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,120
for remembering my preferences.

58
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Don't mention it.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
Didn't he come with you?

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,760
He got held up. He'll be here soon.

61
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Mr. Ma,

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,720
you don't sound
like you're from around here.

63
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,240
What made you decide
to do business in Halan?

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm just a businessman.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,920
I go wherever Lucifer is in demand

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Look at Mr. Ma,

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
successful at such a young age.

69
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,240
You should learn from him.

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,160
In this line of work,

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
it's all about skill.

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,840
Relying on seniority or pulling rank
is the biggest taboo.

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you doing here?

74
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
This isn't your place.

75
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
Go wait downstairs.

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
Are you with Mr. Ma?

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000

for a while now.

82
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,000
I appreciate all your hard work
in Sheng City, Mr. Lin.

83
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,800
That's what I should do.

prepared for you.

86
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
That's not necessary.

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,920
You're being too kind.

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,520
You shouldn't have.

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh my,

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,960
it's quite heavy.

91
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll accept it then.

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,640
It's all clear.

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,280
Lin Zhida is the one trying
to sell meat in Tongling.

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,160
How much is he moving?

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
A couple of bags.

97
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,600
They have people in Tongling
to pick up the goods.

98
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,200
They're using local goods as cover

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
and transporting them by train.

100
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
Lin Zhida's really got guts.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Biting off more than he can chew.

102
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,760
If we don't rein him in,

103
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,400
he'll end up like Qin Yi.

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
Let's teach him a lesson,

105
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
just like the old days.

106
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
Yeah, let's.

107
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
He needs to understand

108
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
that anyone in this province
wanting a piece

109
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
can only get it from our pot.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,640
Wait,

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
what's going on here?

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
I received some local goods

113
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
from Tongling.

114
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
They say walnuts
are good for the brain.

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Have a taste.

116
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Look,

117
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,800
uh, Mr. Ma,

118
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,560
this...

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,440
this is just a misunderstanding.

120
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,840
I didn't know!

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
If I'd known

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
you were already working with Tongling,

123
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,960
I wouldn't have bothered!

124
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,200
If it weren't for you, Mr. Lin,

125
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Lucifer

126
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,040
wouldn't have entered Tongling so soon.

127
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Besides, we'll need your help

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
with the other transport lines too.

129
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
You must accept

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
this gift.

131
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,760
No...

132
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
This...

133
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,480
This is too much.

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,840
I can't take it.

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Gifts from Mr. Ma

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,920
cannot be returned.

137
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,200
Alright,

138
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll take it.

139
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll take it.

140
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
So, Mr. Ma,

141
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
in the future...

142
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,760
In the future,
we'll keep making money together,

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,040
but remember,

144
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,800
sticking to your role
is the only way to go further.

145
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,480
After all,

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
no one wants to end up like Qin Yi,

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,600
right?

148
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Right.

149
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
This tastes great. Try it.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
This really doesn't agree with me.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,920
The police have found out
about Jin Fei's drug abuse.

152
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
Erjin is going to crack sooner or later.

153
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,720
Good thing

154
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,040
he doesn't know much.

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
Even if he talks,

156
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,000
it won't be easy for the cops

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
to get solid evidence.

158
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,760
Our setup's airtight.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
If they try

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
to make a move,

161
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,280
we'll know right away.

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
As long as we withdraw in time,

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
we won't get hurt.

164
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,520
However, all of this depends

165
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,400
on keeping the people
around us in check.

166
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
We can't afford any slip-ups.

167
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Right, Mr. Lin?

168
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,320
Right.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,280
After what happened to Jin Fei,

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,880
you should learn your lesson, Lin Jiang.

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Let's get down
to business now, shall we?

172
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,680
Okay.

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I'll head out now.

174
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,520
Okay.

175
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,800
Take the gift with you.

176
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Yeah.

177
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
Take it.

178
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
You three,

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
keep watch on the elevator
and fire escape.

180
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Don't let anyone in.

181
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,200
Go.

182
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Understood!

183
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,640
Why did you and Mr. Ma

184
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,200
have to give the gift yourselves?

185
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
You didn't give them
gold walnuts, did you?

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
Gold's not worth much.

187
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,320
Mr. Ma's gift is way more valuable.

188
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,880
Hai,

189
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,200
I knew you were a good fighter.

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,000
Didn't realize you were
also a good businessman.

191
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,480
Teach me a thing or two sometime.

192
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, right.

193
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Hai,

194
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,800
these are imported. Marlboro.

195
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
Would you like one?

196
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,440
Stay here. Don't wander off.

197
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,880
Did Zheng Bei

198
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
find anything
about what happened last time?

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
- I'll get going now.
- Alright.

200
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,760
See you, Bei.

201
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,520
The rain's heavy.

202
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
You two should head back.

203
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,120
Bei, I'm off to work then.

204
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,200
Alright, be careful.

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,840
Will do.

206
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280
Cut back on the smoking.

207
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,440
Why you always on me?

208
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,720
Hai.

209
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,800
You seemed distracted just now.

210
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,800
The shipment's about to move.
Stay sharp.

211
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,760
Got it.

212
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
Hai,

213
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,680
I just saw Long walk by.

214
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
Long?

215
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah.

216
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,400
What's he doing here?

217
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,640
I don't know either.

218
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,080
The public security bureau
is just ahead.

219
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
Give me your raincoat.

220
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Okay.

221
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
Drop the knife!

222
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
Freeze!

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,040
Run!

224
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,440
Who are you?

225
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,800
Why did you help me?

226
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Thanks.

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
You hurt a cop.

228
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,840
Getting caught is just
a matter of time.

229
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,520
You know what to say

230
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
when it happens, right?

231
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
Yes.

232
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,440
You've been shot.

233
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,240
Go get that looked at.

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm fine. I've got body armor.

235
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Let's split up.

236
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
Stay away from the cops.

237
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,040
If I hadn't been
running goods that day

238
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,840
with protection,

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
you would've gotten me killed.

240
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
When you delivered that sniper rifle

242
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,720
and told Madam

243
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
that Mr. Ma was going
to take out Qin Yi,

244
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,280
I knew you were really something.

245
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
After all, Qin Yi was your godfather.

246
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,920
If my godfather hadn't
lost control of his men

247
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,040
and let Song Wen swipe a bag of meth,

248
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,920
the cops wouldn't have
gotten onto Lucifer so quickly.

249
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
And his greed kept growing.

250
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
He was making meth on his own,

251
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,080
trying to push Mr. Ma out.

252
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
If he were still alive,

253
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
none of us would be.

254
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
I had no choice.

255
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
But I was doing him a favor.

256
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
I promised him
when I was a kid

257
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
that I'd take care of him in the end.

258
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
Yeah, it was because
of his guy, Song Wen,

259
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,920
that we ended up on the cops' radar.

260
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,400
The police questioned you

261
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,960
after the White Building incident,
right?

262
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,720
Didn't they suspect
you killed Song Wen?

263
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't kill him.

264
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
That guy was something else.

265
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
He hung on by the window for ages.

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,200
Just when I was about to let go

267
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,880
and be done with it,

268
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
he stopped breathing.

269
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,360
It was obvious to the coroner

270
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
that he was stabbed to death,

271
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
not killed by the fall.

272
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,800
How could it be pinned on me?

273
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,080
Thanks for what you did that night
when I stopped Gu Yiran.

274
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,040
No need to thank me.

275
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,720
You've been working
for my sister for so long.

276
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
You know too much.

277
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
I couldn't let the cops
get their hands on you.

278
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,080
Still,

279
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,240
you saved me.

280
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,680
I owe you one.

281
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,020
[Wanhuang Hotel]

282
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Dad...

283
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
Please, stop.

284
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,080
We're not short on money anyway.

285
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Why go through all this?

286
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,800
Don't dwell on this anymore.

287
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,080
Just put the stuff in the safe.

288
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
I'll deliver the money to them tomorrow.

289
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,840
What's wrong?

290
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Lin Zhida sent a message
through my sister,

291
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,480
saying he'd accepted the real "gift,"

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,600
and that from now on,
if you said jump, he'd ask how high.

293
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,640
Pickpockets are all cowards.

294
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,560
If you ask me,

295
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,560
we should've put a real bomb there.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,320
We did put a real bomb.

297
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
It just didn't go off.

298
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Either way, the Lin family

299
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,000
is completely under control now.

300
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,440
We can move ahead
with the next shipment as planned.

301
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,640
You're dead already?

302
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,520
Yep.

303
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,760
How's your sister doing?

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,680
If she's feeling overwhelmed,

305
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,040
tell her to take a break from work.

306
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
She's been checking out
cemetery plots lately,

307
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
hoping it'll bring some good luck

308
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
and get my brother-in-law reprieved.

309
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Back when Song Kang was arrested,

310
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,160
anyone who showed disloyalty

311
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
was dealt with by my sister.

312
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,320
Don't worry.

313
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,720
She can handle it.

314
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,040
I wouldn't have brought her in
if she couldn't.

315
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:19,700
[Two years ago]

316
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,960
Yingzi,

317
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
this is Mr. Ma,

318
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,160
my brother-in-arms.

319
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,760
Xiaohai, you've really grown up.

320
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,600
You kept this hidden well,

321
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,640
even from me.

322
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
Did you two meet in Yuedong?

323
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,200
You could say that.

324
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,040
This is the new product Mr. Ma developed

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,800
based on Song Kang's recipe.

326
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
No one knew

327
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
Song's recipe

328
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,600
besides his own cooks.

329
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
How did you get it?

330
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,200
That's not important.

331
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
What matters is

332
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm the only one in Halan

333
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,320
who can make this top-quality stuff.

334
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Yingzi,

335
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,240
I know you can get the raw materials.

336
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,440
If you team up with Mr. Ma,

337
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,120
we won't just take over Halan,

338
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
we could dominate

339
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
the whole province.

340
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,480
I couldn't convince you to quit,

341
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,240
but working with Mr. Ma

342
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
will at least keep us safe.

343
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
Xiaohai told me

344
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
you were from the south.

345
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
Right, Mr. Ma?

346
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,080
You came all this way.

347
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
How many men did you bring?

348
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,840
Can you really handle
all the local thugs here?

349
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
I've always believed

350
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,000
you don't need
lots of people under you.

351
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,480
You just need a few
who are brave, smart, and loyal,

352
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
like your guy, Long.

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Some people

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
spend their whole lives

355
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,120
as nothing more
than small-time bullies.

356
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,240
If they obey me,
I'll make sure they become useful.

357
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
As for those who don't,

358
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,480
they'll be taken out of the game.

359
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
The plant manager my sister picked

360
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,600
has a much smaller appetite

361
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
than that of Guo from Yunhui.

362
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,920
So we've saved a lot on bribes.

363
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,800
The next shipment

364
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,280
increased by 30%.

365
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
I think that plant can handle more

366
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,440
if we need to raise it further.

367
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
Two more shipments,

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,400
and then we'll start expanding
into other cities.

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Sounds good!

370
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,960
The guns we ordered
should be here soon, right?

371
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
Yeah, the samples arrive tomorrow.

372
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,480
They'll go straight to the office.

373
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,600
Be there to check the goods with me.

374
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
Look, our current gear

375
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,280
is getting so old it's holding us back.

376
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,680
It still works for now.

377
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,920
Still works?

378
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
So we shouldn't have bought new gear?

379
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Of course not.

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,440
Guns are lifesavers.

381
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
The foreigners have gear

382
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
way more advanced than ours.

383
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,960
Leave it now.

- Play this instead.

Good thing Bei

396
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
had briefed all the police
in the province

397
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,000
about the Lucifer case in advance.

398
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
Otherwise, the Tongling police

399
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
wouldn't have picked up

400
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
on the local meth deal so quickly.

401
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,560
If Jiang Yingzi isn't Mr. Ma,

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,360
then who is?

403
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
That was really bold of him.

404
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,360
Is Sheng City's market
not big for him anymore?

405
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,720
Now he's trying to push north?

406
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,240
I don't think these are Mr. Ma's men.

407
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Last time, when they shipped drugs
to Sheng City,

408
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Mr. Ma was smart enough

409
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
to use towels as the carrier.

410
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
But for this Tongling shipment,

411
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,880
the drugs were simply
transported by train.

412
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,120
If he were really that dumb,

413
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,440
he wouldn't have
stayed hidden this long.

414
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,920
But based on what we know,

415
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,840
Lucifer is the only meth

on the market right now.

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,120
If he's not behind this,

418
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,560
then who is?

419
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,920
It's possible someone's
trying to bypass Mr. Ma

420
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,960
and take a piece of the market.

421
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,520
We've questioned those two guys,

422
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,360
but they didn't give anything up.

423
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,720
They probably knew

424
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,160
the police didn't find the goods,

425
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,560
so they stuck to the story

426
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
that they were just thieves

Stay quiet in jail all they want.

Once they're out,

431
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
we'll tail them

to have the windows cleaned
before the Spring Festival.

Why are they still dirty?

I had a cleaner
scheduled for this morning,

485
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,840
but as soon as we started work,

486
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,200

488
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,120

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,040
Talk now.

When they saw my new car,

497
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,800
they were overjoyed.

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,840
They're too attached to their neighbors.

a two-story house this year

Both voices faded at the same time.

at the company now.

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,400
Cancel it.

are holding us back.

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,320
At this rate,

543
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,000
we won't be able to
deal in the city anymore.

544
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,280
I'm sure my cover is blown now.

545
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,800
They'll be on me

546
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,800
the moment I leave the city.

547
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,680
According to our plan,

548
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,880
it's time to take action now.

549
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,240
Take out that special task force,

550
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,400
especially

551
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Zheng Bei.

552
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,000
I know you admire him,

553
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,360
but there's no other way.

554

I can do it.

I'm the only one who can.

558
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,760

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
Is that warehouse
in the eastern suburbs still empty?

562
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,400
Yeah.

563
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,080
I'll set things up.

right in downtown Halan.

Hello, who is this?

568
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,360
Hello, Bei.

569
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,960
Can you talk now?

570
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,960
Xiaohai,

571
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,040
what's up?

572
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,520
I need to tell you something.

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,600
Go ahead.

574
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,680
Qin Yi had a few minions

575
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
who weren't involved in the drugs,

576
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,600
so they didn't get caught.

577
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,760
Then?

578
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,200
They've got a new boss now,

579
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,160
which seems tied to your case.

580
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,840
I heard

581
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,640
some foreigners are bringing in
a batch of guns to Halan.

582
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,200
Selling guns?

583
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,400
Who's the buyer?

584
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,920
A foreign trade company, I think.

585
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
How did you find out?

586
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,640
I know

587
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
one of the guys pretty well.

588
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,080
The other day, he was
bragging while drinking,

589
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,160
saying he's making a big deal soon.

590
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,720
That's how I found out.

591

You got the time and place?

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,400
The warehouse in the eastern suburbs
at 9:30 AM tomorrow.

593

Weren't all the warehouses

594

in the eastern suburbs demolished?

595
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,600
This one was used for coal storage.

596
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,840
It's abandoned now.

597
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,000
I know that place.

is that I got beaten up
by human traffickers,

732
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,040
by my adoptive father,

733
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,920

00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,480
became a drug lord's mistress,

and my godfather, who saved my life,

738
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
was a drug dealer too.

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Help us

749
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,000
catch Liang Jiaju.

750
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,160
You can still make things right.

751
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,920
It's not too late.

752
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,200
Not too late? Really?

753
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:27,960
My dear brother...

754
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,160
No.

755
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,680
Zheng Bei.

756
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,800
We're actually the same age.

757
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,480
Why are our lives so different?

758
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,080
Could it be

759
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,280
that a person's fate is decided

760
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,880
the moment they're born?

761
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,480
Xiaohai,

762
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,200
I know you've had
a tough time over the years,

763
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,840
but plenty of people
have been through worse,

764
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,320
and they didn't become drug dealers

765
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,720
or criminals.

766
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,760
Xiaohai, you made the wrong choice,

767
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,600
you know?

768
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,000
Did I have a choice, Brother?

769
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,840
No.

770
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,200
Zheng Bei, you're really good
at spouting all this righteous talk.

771
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,640
Sometimes, I even

772
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,480
feel sorry for you.

773
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,720
What do you mean?

774
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,160
You always treated me well.

775
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,640
After learning I was Lele,

776
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,040
you were even better.

777
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,560
Your sense of guilt runs deep.

778
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,400
You've carried it for years.

779
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,760
Now that you finally
have a chance to make things right,

780
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,360
you're treating me
like your own brother,

781
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,240
right?

782
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,800
Now the truth is out.

783
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,160
The person you wanted
to make things right with

784
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,560
has been on the opposite side all along.

785
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,800
Everything you gave him,

786
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,880
your effort,

787
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,680
care,

788
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,320
love,

789
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,240
it's all just a joke now.

790
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:49,960
Oh,

791
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,000
do you remember
the note I left at your house?

792
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,320
"I'll become someone
you can be proud of."

793
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,200
What do you think?

794
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,400
Have I done it?

795
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,920
Xiaohai,

796
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,920
this is no justification
for your crimes.

797
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,280
What have I done?

798
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,240
Do you have the proof?

799
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,120
Can you arrest me?

800
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,520
Do you really think

801
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,000
you can get away with all this?

802
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,040
Can't I?

803
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,560
If you had enough evidence,

804
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,160
I'd already be in cuffs.

805
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
No point wasting time
convincing me to turn myself in.

806
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,600
Am I right?

807
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,040
You must hate me by now

808
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,200
I do.

809
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,320
But I don't hate you for lying,

810
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,200
or even for trying to blow me up
with those detonators.

811
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,160
Because I've already

812
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,360
convinced myself

813
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,880
that you're not a good person.

814
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,920
What I hate is

815
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,720
that this very bad person

816
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,400
thought about saving me.

817
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,840
When I was leaving, you grabbed my arm.

818
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,520
You should've just watched me

819
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,760
walk out and get blown up

820
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,960
with a smile.

821
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,360
But you grabbed me...

822
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,360
and then let go.

823
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,400
Xiaohai,

824
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,440
Lele,

825
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,080
is there really no turning back?

826
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,400
I've come too far

827
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,040
to turn back now.

828
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,920
Goodbye,

829
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,920
big brother.
