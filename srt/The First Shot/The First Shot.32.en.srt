00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,800
The warehouse was robbed.

194
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,720
I was brought on board hiding in a box.

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
What kind of ship?

196
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,880
Where is it?

197
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
It's a cargo ship

198
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
on a river.

199
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
It's next to

200
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
an abandoned dock.

201
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
An abandoned dock?

202
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
In what direction?

203
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
The road took about

204
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
an hour.

205
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,440
To the northeast.

206
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,880
The northeast.

207
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,920
Isn't there

208
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,360
a small dock in Wujia Village

209
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,360
that's been abandoned for years?

210
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah. There's one at the river's head.

211
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
Yeah. It seems to be a small dock.

212
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,280
The ship isn't moving yet.

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,800
I don't know when they're going to sail.

214
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,640
Okay. Stay hidden.

215
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll be right over with my team.

216
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,160
Director Gao,

217
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
they took advantage of the explosion

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,520
to run north.

219
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,280
They're loading all the drugs
onto the ship now.

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,560
If they keep heading east,

221
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,840
we'll never catch them

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,040
once they get out of the country.

223
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,040
He can't get out.

224
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,160
We must stop them.

225
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,240
We can't let them get away.

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,560
Now we have to hurry

227
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,040
and contact the police at Songmen River.

228
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
I'll call Director Song.

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,800
You guys go first. Seize the time.

230
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,560
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

231
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,920
I'll quickly request
a deployment of police

232
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,800
from Songmen River.

233
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,760
[Halan Public Security Bureau]
They'll coordinate with you

234
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,600
in carrying out the operation.

235
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,880
We can't let the drugs
leave the country.

236
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:23,420

Dong?

239
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Dong.

240

Hands up, Li Wenlong.

242

How did you get on board?

243
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
Keep your hands up!

Guys!

245
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Drop your gun.

Kick it over here.

247
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,040
Tell them to drop their weapons.

248
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Sail.

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,320
Stop moving!

You're alone?

251
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,680
You followed us from the warehouse.

252
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,240
You only have one bullet.

253
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,440
There are two of us here.

254
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
Figure out who you'll shoot.

255
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,640
You only have one chance.

Move.

Move.

Move.

Hey, you're at the dock, right?

280
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
Yeah. I'm loading.

281
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,240
Have you got Madam out?

282
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
There was some trouble,

283
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
but I've solved it.

284
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,800
Wait for us to meet up.

285
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,680
Okay.

286
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,680
Du, go get some warm water.

288
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,880

Sit down.

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
Jiang Xiaohai,

292
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,560
do you know what you're doing?

293
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,960
Yeah.

294
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
Guozhu,

295
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,840
what's Jiang Yingzi doing?

296
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,680
If you want to live, respond wisely.

297
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Everything's fine, Bei.

298
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,480
Jiang Yingzi is asleep.

299
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Don't worry.

300
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,400
Have you had lunch?

301
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Yeah.

302
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,200
I had a spicy sauce roll. It was nice.

303
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,520
You know your stuff.

304
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,120
Guozhu,

305
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,320
take a break.

306
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Why did you come back?

307
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Get out now.

308
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Yingzi,

309
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
congratulations on your discharge.

310
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
I went to lengths

311
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
to draw the police here

312
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
to prevent you from
coming back to save me.

313
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
Why did you come here?

314
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,960
No wonder you had to make such a scene.

315
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
You want to force me to leave.

316
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,560
But by the time you caused trouble,

317
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
I was already in the hospital.

318
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,080
Get out of my way!

319
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
Don't do anything stupid.

320
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,720
Step back!

321
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,800
But there's a silver lining
to your mess.

322
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,640
That phone call just now

323
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,320
made Zheng Bei think that
I've already left.

324
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,080
It'll be easier for us to get out now.

325
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,600
You're taking a huge risk,
you know that?

326
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,960
Yingzi, I've arranged a route
out of the country.

327
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,920
but it won't work if I leave by myself.

328
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you remember Haishenwai's Mr. Qi?

329
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Yeah.

330
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
Song saved his life.

331
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
He's already agreed to take us to leave,

332
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,600
but we must leave together.

333
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,720
Let's go.

334
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,240
Easy.

335
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Should I call you Xiaohai

336
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,920
or Mr. Ma?

337
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,400
Yingzi,

338
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,040
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

339
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't need to do that from now on.

340
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,120
Where's Mao?

341
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
What about Mao?

342
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,440
After we leave Halan,

343
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
you'll see Mao.

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,840
Where's Long?

345
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
Long

346
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
robbed Lucifer.

347
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
He's waiting for us at the dock.

348
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
Let's go meet up with him.

349
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,480
Yingzi,

350
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,240
I told him to send a text

351
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
every five minutes.

352
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,800
He's gone dark now.

353
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
The police must've caught him.

354
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,720
Don't worry, Yingzi.

355
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,800
We have other ways.

356
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
That batch doesn't matter.

357
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
I have Lucifer's formula and technique

358
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,720
memorized.

359
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,600
Mr. Ma,

360
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
you've hidden quite well.

361
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,200
I didn't realize until now

362
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
that Liu Bowen gave you Song's formula

363
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,080
while you were in Zhanzhou's prison.

364
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,800
When I went to prison,

365
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,960
I was just a kid,

366
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,160
but the other inmates weren't nice to me

367
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
just because I was young.

368
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,800
I was bullied every day
for the first two years.

369
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,840
I had to protect myself.

370
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,480
Later on,

371
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,440
I managed to protect not only myself

372
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
but also other people.

373
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
One of them

374
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,840
was Liu Bowen.

375
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,120
Look at me.

376
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
What are the rules here?

377
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,960
I've been teaching you,
but you keep forgetting.

378
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
How can you be so stupid?

379
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Stay down.

380
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
He was grateful to me.

381
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,720
He said he didn't know
