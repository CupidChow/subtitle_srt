[Episode 18: The Master revealed his identity in the Jinluan Hall]

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,860
My lord,

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,070
you have my unwavering loyalty.

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,030
If you don't believe me,

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,230
I'm willing to kill myself

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,140
to prove my innocence.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,520
What are you doing?

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,260
I never doubted you.

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,310
I've sent someone

12
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,430
to secretly investigate your case.

13
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,030
I will definitely clear you.

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,130
You and I will protect His Majesty

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,440
during the welcome ceremony in the Jinluan Hall tomorrow.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,500
Thank you, my lord.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Shi Jianchuan, what did you do?

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,900
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,700
What I did

20
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,150
is unforgivable.

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,110
I deserve to die.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,729
What did you do to me yesterday?

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,060
I...

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,330
Your Highness, I…

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,590
You took me to your room

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,810
while I was drunk

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,890
and humiliated me.

28
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,890
I'll tell my father and His Majesty.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,400
I know I made a drunken mistake.

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,570
It's unforgivable.

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,700
If you want me to die,

32
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,930
I'll kill myself now

33
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,139
to clear your name.

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,650
No, I didn't say you should die.

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,020
I was just kidding.

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,630
After you left early in the morning,

37
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,980
I found that you were quite nice to me.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,190
I used to have feelings for Moyan.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,740
So,

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,890
I didn't notice how good you were to me.

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,540
Last night...

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,050
I made a drunken mistake last night

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,470
and humiliated you.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,890
Don't worry. I'll be responsible.

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,870
What? You don't want to?

46
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,410
Of course I want to.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,010
Your affection

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,690
is my honour.

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,930
I fell for you

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,110
the first time I met you.

51
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,390
But I'm a man of humble origins,

52
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,930
I didn't dare to tell you.

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,010
I was happy enough to be your

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,110
secret guardian.

55
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,340
No more.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,750
My husband

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,880
must be confident

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,650
and admirable.

59
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,830
You must have a remarkable achievement

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,230
and do better than Moyan.

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,740
I will do my best to achieve my aspirations.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,980
I won't fail you.

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,940
You look cute when you're serious.

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,650
I didn't realize

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,390
you were my type.

66
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,730
Watch out, Your Highness.

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,760
Hide here. Don't come out.

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,910
He's hot.

69
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,540
It's time.

70
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,190
Are you ready?

71
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,060
Priest, how is your injury?

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,760
Maybe we should go back.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,490
I'm okay.

74
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,590
Where else do you want to go later?

75
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,590
I can go with you.

76
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,090
Mr. Leng, which rebel are you trying to arrest now?

77
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,140
I'm here to take her away.

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,350
Have you forgotten, Mr. Leng?

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,350
Miss Shiqi is under His Majesty's order to protect me.

80
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,130
His Majesty's order:

81
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,830
To investigate the rebels' conspiracy to assassinate His Majesty,

82
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,540
all the government departments and agencies

83
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,380
are under the leadership of the Investigation Bureau

84
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,670
until the Mid-Autumn Sacrificial Ceremony.

85
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,870
Any other questions?

86
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's go.

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,460
There are so many soldiers in the capital.

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,840
Why do you have to take her?

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,320
What I do

90
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,670
has nothing to do with you.

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,500
Enough.

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,740
Are you two done?

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,740
No one's asking about what I want.

94
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,620
It's a good opportunity for you to get promoted.

95
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
Of course you should go back with me.

96
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,660
Are you saying

97
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,780
I'll only be promoted if I goes back to the Investigation Bureau?

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,190
I want to go back to the Secret Guards Department.

99
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,010
Unfortunately,

100
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,610
the Secret Guards Department is also under my control.

101
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,280
Let’s go.

102
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,159
Protect the Priest.

103
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,890
Yes, my lord.

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,140
Your Majesty,

105
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,520
the Persian envoys have brought back a lot of things.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,070
They also brought back a national treasure-level gift from the King of Persia.

107
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,290
They would like to present it to Your Majesty.

108
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,800
Good, present the gift.

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,900
Protect His Majesty! Protect His Majesty!

110
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,470
Don't let anyone escape!

111
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,000
Be careful, Your Majesty!

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Your Majesty!

113
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
Jianchuan, what are you doing?

114
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,170
Get His Majesty out of here first.

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
Don't go with him.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,810
He's behind all of this.

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,780
Priest, what are you talking about?

118
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,880
Shi Jianchuan, deputy of the Investigation Bureau,

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,870
is deeply involved in many cases.

120
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,610
He tried to assassinate His Majesty in public today.

121
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,070
Leng Moyan must have something to do with it.

122
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,130
My lord,

123
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,760
I'll meet you on the other side.

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,640
What are you doing?

125
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,770
Shengu Feng.

126
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,580
You can’t

127
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,800
frame me.

128
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,230
Do you know why?

129
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,540
Because he's not Leng Moyan.

130
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,850
He is actually Marquis Lu, my trusted confidant.

131
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,900
In order to suppress the rebels,

132
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,510
I decreed that no one could know he was dead.

133
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,050
You may leave.

134
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,500
I had my studying companion,

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,450
Marquis Lu to pretend to be Leng Moyan

137
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,980
and be the chief of the Investigation Bureau.

138
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,460
He has lived up to my expectations these two years.

139
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,550
Master.

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Leng Moyan and Fox don't look alike at all.

141
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,220
And you didn't tell?

142
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,500
Leng Moyan handled cases viciously and had many enemies.

143
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,110
So he always wore a mask to hide his identity

144
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,310
and used a fake voice.

145
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,480
No wonder his behaviour suddenly

146
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,950
changed over a year ago.

147
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,409
And he took off his mask.

148
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,480
It wasn't him.

149
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,430
Your Majesty, even if he's Marquis Lu,

150
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,590
he can't be cleared of the suspicions of assassination and rebellion.

151
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,510
Because he has a hidden identity.

152
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,670
What?

153
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,420
He was an illegitimate son of the late Emperor

154
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,610
when he visited the people in disguise.

155
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,350
His mother was a lowly woman.

156
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
So the late Emperor hid the truth

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,940
and brought him to the palace in the name of a studing companion.

158
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,870
Priest.

159
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,150
Do you have any evidence?

160
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,820
I found these letters and a love token

161
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,260
between the late Emperor and his mother in his family's ancestral home.

162
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,460
The evidence is solid.

163
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Marquis Lu, are you going to deny it?

164
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,740
I remember

165
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,980
you were indeed brought into the palace by the late Emperor.

166
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,550
He even gave you a name.

167
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,740
Lu,

168
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,570
is the Priest telling the truth?

169
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,230
Your Majesty, it's true.

170
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,940
If it's the truth,

171
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,220
why didn't you tell me?

172
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,020
Marquis Lu is dissatisfied with his status.

173
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
He planned to infiltrate the palace

174
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,540
and attempted to assassinate Your Majesty and usurp the throne.

175
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Please be judicious, Your Majesty.

176
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,830
Marquis Lu,

177
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,410
I've always treated you well.

178
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,260
I never thought I'd bring disaster upon myself.

179
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,060
Guards!

180
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,090
Lock him up in the imperial prison.

181
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,350
Yes.

182
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,670
Your Majesty, I didn't tell you the truth.

183
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,030
But I never thought of usurping the throne.

184
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,070
Please be judicious, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,230
Your Majesty, I can testify for him.

186
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,870
Marquis Lu will never rebel.

187
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,770
We have witness and evidence.

188
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,720
Whoever pleads for him

189
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
will be put into prison.

190
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,620
But Your Majesty...

191
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,540
Your Majesty.

192
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,820
Mei Shiqi is young and ignorant.

193
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,420
She didn't think it through.

194
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,400
I'll punish her severely

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,330
after we go back to the Department.

196
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,870
Take him away.

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,310
Marquis Lu.

198
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,740
Move.
