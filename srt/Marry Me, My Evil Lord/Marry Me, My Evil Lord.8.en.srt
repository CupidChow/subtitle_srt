00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,760
That won't do.

What if there are assassins?

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,910
Wouldn't we be at their mercy?

28
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,950
Then you go outside to monitor and provide support.

to release Mr. Leng.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Otherwise, don't blame me for destroying your Secret Guards Department.

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,690
Shi Jianchuan, don't be too domineering.

118

Leng Moyan is suspected of participating in the assassination of the Emperor.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,710
The Secret Guards Department is conducting a fair investigation.

120
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,710
If any of you dare to keep obstructing us,

121
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll arrest all of you.

122
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,330
You are distorting the facts and framing him.

123
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,760
You know best who the rebels were

124
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,370

Go!

128
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,880
I've heard it long ago that the Investigation Bureau

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,900
and the Secret Guards Department are the two most powerful

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,960
and capable security organizations in the Yu Dynasty.

131
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,090
So, this is all you've got?

132
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,640
With just a small plan of mine,

133
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,960
I've led all of you into my trap.

Who are you?

135
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,150
He is the mastermind behind the ambush case.

136
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,490
He disguised himself as people from the Investigation Bureau,

137
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,360
infiltrated the assassin, disguised as a geisha, into the Lotus Wonderland,

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,680
pretended to assassinate His Majesty during the birthday banquet,

139
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,610
deliberately framed Prince Jing,

140
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
and orchestrated the removal of the guards

141
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,280
at the back door of Residence of Prince Jing

142
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,880
to facilitate the escape of the female rebel.

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
That's right.

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,030
The so-called Leng Moyan,

145
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,710
known for his unmatched intelligence and unrivaled strategies,

146
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,750
was fooled by our Master.

147
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,320
Mr. Leng, are you impressed?

148
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,200
You really work for the Master.

149
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,210
That's right. Today is just a trial.

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,670
Just for you to experience the might of our Wolf Eagle Guards.

151
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,670
What a ridiculous Wolf Eagle Guards.

152
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,780
A woman trying to assassinate His Majesty?

153
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,580
She overestimated her ability.

154
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,550
Their true purpose was not to assassinate His Majesty

155
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,550
but to sow discord between

156
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,870
the Investigation Bureau and the Secret Guards Department,

157
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,250
making us harm

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,850
and suspect each other.

159
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,440
This way, they can take advantage of the situation

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,960
and defeat us all.

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,970
This day next year will be the anniversary of the downfall

162
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,500
of the Investigation Bureau and the Secret Guards Department.

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,700
Kill them all.

164
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,930
Aren't you all injured?

165
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,360
If the Secret Guards Department and the Investigation Bureau

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
didn't play along in this act of mutual harm,

167
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,260
how could we lure you out?

168
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,060
You...

169
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,710
You saw through it a long time ago?

170
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,040
I had a feeling that something was off before,

171
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
but I couldn't figure it out.

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,610
It wasn't until I went to the West Pavilion

173
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,830
and found two different groups of people

174
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,030
hidden inside and outside the pavilion

175
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,620
that I understood.

176
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,850
This is a play of

177
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,050
"the wolf has a winning game when the shepherds quarrel."

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,590
Be quiet. There are assassins.

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,410
So many bodyguards for a date?

180
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,570
You are more extravagant than I am.

181
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
I know. I'm not talking about them.

182
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,010
Go over there and take a look.

183
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,350
Who are outside?

184
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,940
The people who have been fooling us around.

185
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,030
Have you

186
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,200
already found the evidence of my ambush on His Majesty?

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,540
You admit it?

188
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,000
The geisha who entered the mansion to perform

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,630
was arranged by you.

190
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
The guards at the back door

191
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,130
were also removed by you.

192
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,550
Those were all impostors pretending to be me.

193
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,230
The goal was to shift the suspicion onto me.

194
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,870
Why should we believe you?

195
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,930
Because I've also found evidence of your involvement.

196
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,170
The owner behind the scenes at the Lotus Wonderland is Prince Jing.

197
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,590
What should we do now?

198
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,030
-Arrest him.
-Arrest me.

199
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,060
Who are you guys?

200
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,190
What do you want?

201
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,320
What are you waiting for?

202
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Take off your mask

203
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,340
and surrender.

204
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,610
Looks like I have no other choice.
