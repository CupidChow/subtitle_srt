4
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,820
You have nowhere to run.

5
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,950
Surrender now.

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,880
I don't think so.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,720
Who are you?

8
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,740
We finally meet.

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,950
When did you realize something was wrong?

10
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,670
Since I found out

11
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,990
the owner of Lotus Wonderland is Prince Jing.

12
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,360
Prince Jing's Residence?

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,020
If he really wanted to assassinate His Majesty,

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,490
he wouldn't have hidden the assassin in his own property,

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,720
let alone make a move at his own birthday banquet.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,970
The murderer's arrangement is

17
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,260
clearly aimed at diverting suspicion onto him.

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,060
Once we capture the leader of the masked men,

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,590
the truth will be revealed.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,630
Unfortunately,

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,320
we still have no leads on the female "ghost".

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,190
I also interrogated those two Oirans.

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,160
Although they both had the Fallen Star River sachets,

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
they were not related to the ambush.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,220
By the way,

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,320
when did you find out

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,180
that the performer at the banquet

28
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,800
was chosen by the Investigation Bureau?

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,729
She's also one of the Oirans at the Lotus Wonderland.

[Lotus Wonderland]

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,450
Miss Luo,

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,850
I can see that you have strong arms.

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,140
Have you learned martial arts?

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,380
Mr lord, I've been practicing dancing since I was a child,

35
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,950
so I'm naturally stronger than others.

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,370
I've never learned martial arts.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,850
My lord,

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,610
this is the one who was in charge of selecting the performer that day.

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,700
Let me see.

40
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,630
Shi Jianchuan?

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,410
Is he really from the Investigation Bureau?

42
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,690
When did he come to select the performer?

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,100
It should be four days before His Highness's birthday,

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,390
on June 30.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,660
Do you know

46
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,220
the consequences of framing an official?

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,930
Please spare my life.

48
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,010
Everything I said is true.

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,100
I dare not lie to you, my lord.

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,590
Five days before Prince Jing's birthday,

51
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,730
Jianchuan was assigned away for a mission

52
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,090
and no longer in the capital.

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,520
Are you still denying the framing?

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,040
Everything I said is true.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,630
If I lie about anything,

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
may I be struck by lightning

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,550
and die a wretched death.

58
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,660
Fine, I'll summon him now so he can

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,850
confront you in person.

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,829
My lord,

61
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,390
the thief has quite skilled martial arts.

62
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,590
I couldn't defeat him

63
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,760
and let him escape.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,870
Aren't you the best swordsman in the capital?

65
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,280
There's someone you can't defeat?

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,720
Winning and losing are both common.

67
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,579
It doesn't matter. Let me ask you.

68
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,560
Where were you on June 30?

69
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,850
I was chasing down a bandit in the Taihang Mountains.

70
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,510
Have you been to Lotus Wonderland

71
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,540
to select the performer for Prince Jing's birthday banquet?

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,730
Prince Jing's birthday?

73
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,690
Why would I select a performer for him?

74
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,820
I have never been to Lotus Wonderland.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,090
But this Miss Luo

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,550
insists that

77
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,600
she saw you that day.

78
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,610
My lord, maybe my face is too common.

79
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,670
She may have mistaken me for someone else.

80
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,900
My lord, please believe me.

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,470
I'm telling the truth.

82
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,760
Alright, you can leave for now.

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,240
Thank you, my lord.

84
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,100
It's her. It smells exactly the same.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
What should we do now?

86
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll take her to the bureau for interrogation.

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,350
Why? I found her.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,659
I recognized her real identity.

89
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,730
I'll take her to the Secret Guards Department.

90
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,960
Jianchuan.

91
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,950
Explain to her why.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,330
Sorry, Miss Shiqi.

93
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,820
Leng Moyan, you stinky fox!

94
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,450
Oh.

95
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,290
Miss.

96
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,620
Who tied you up like this?

97
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,020
My lord.

98
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,010
My lord, Luo Qingchen has confessed it all.

99
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,850
She indeed followed the "master's commands",

100
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,660
disguised herself, joined the troupe of performers,

101
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,870
and posed as Consort Chen's ghost to assassinate His Majesty.

102
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,080
She fought with Mei Shiqi and escaped.

103
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,110
Did she reveal the identity of the master?

104
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,060
She said a man wearing a mask sent a message,

105
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,230
but she didn't know who he was.

106
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Any news of the leader of masked men?

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,530
No, this person is cunning

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
and meticulous.

109
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,700
He didn't leave any trails.

110
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,370
Every person leaves a trace,

111
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,340
just like geese leave their tracks.

112
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,770
There must be clues.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,840
Investigate carefully.

114
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,390
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,940
Let her sign the confession.

116
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,000
Send her to the dungeon,

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
and interrogate her another day.

118
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,490
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,170
Take her away.

120
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,870
Get up.

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,620
Lord Leng. Deputy Shi.

122
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,290
This...

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,530
My lord, there are no signs of torture on the corpse.

124
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,659
No signs of asphyxiation,

125
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,930
and no traces of poison.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,130
How did she die then?

127
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,590
I can't tell.

128
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,020
She died through poison.

129
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,290
You may leave.

130
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,880
This is the cause of death.

131
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,900
Lord Leng.

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,640
Who gave this to Luo Qingchen?

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
It was me.

134
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,570
The evidence is clear now.

135
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,790
Lord Leng.

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,350
Please hand over everyone who has had contact

137
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,430
with the red ink paste to us.

138
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,220
No one else.

139
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,050
It was all me.

140
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,230
Lord Leng and the deputies were present during the interrogation.

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
It has nothing to do with him.

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,210
The ink paste for the Investigation Bureau's

143
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,070
major criminal was personally placed in the office

144
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,190
and taken out during the interrogation by me.

145
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
OK.

146
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,760
Shisan.

147
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,720
Yes.

148
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,550
Take Lord Leng and Shi Jianchuan

149
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,220
to the Secret Guards Department for questioning.

150
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,550
Yes.

151
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,200
Who dares?

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,659
Don't move.

153
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,210
What are you doing?

154
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,500
Everyone, stay still.

155
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,680
Leng Moyan, we are on official orders to investigate the case.

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,110
If your Investigation Bureau resists,

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,940
are you not afraid of dire consequences?

158
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Step back.

159
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,750
My lord.

160
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,090
Everyone, step back.

161
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,920
Watch out!

162
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,400
My lord.

163
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,340
Cover Lord Leng!

164
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,380
Surround them.

165
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,730
Surround them now.

166
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,740
As an official of the court,

167
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,520
using such despicable means

168
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,340
is utterly shameful.

169
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,670
Hurry! Surround them!

170
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,020
Lock the city gate!

171
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,400
Search the entire city.

172
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,100
Yes, sir.

173
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,419
As an imperial official,

174
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,929
he actually used such despicable means.

175
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,960
Find him

176
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,440
at all costs!

177
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,990
Yes, sir.

178
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,190
Look.

179
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,790
We've been looking for days,

180
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,520
and still no signs of Leng Moyan.

181
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,730
How could we know

182
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,010
where he is hiding?

183
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,120
Why did you kill Luo Qingchen?

184
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,220
I'm at least a fifth-rank official.

185
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,650
How could you treat me like this?

186
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,110
Let go.

187
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,380
It's easier to tell the truth when you're embarrassed.

188
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,020
Isn't this the technique of your Investigation Bureau?

189
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,250
If you don't confess,

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll bring ten people here to watch you.

191
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
The ink paste is mine,

192
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,110
but I didn't poison it.

193
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,230
Can't you see it's a setup?

194
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,190
Then why did you run off?

195
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,500
This is called escaping from punishment.

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,160
My office is heavily guarded.

197
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,580
The murderer not only knew

198
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,780
I'd use this ink paste for Luo Qingchen,

199
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,460
and poisoned it without being noticed.

200
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,060
This person must be an insider.

201
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,790
That's why I can't be captured.

202
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,080
So you're implying

203
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,140
there's a traitor?

204
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,490
Give me two more days.

205
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,950
I will prove my innocence.

206
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,930
No, as a secret guard,

207
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,690
it's my duty to arrest you.

208
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,770
Only His Majesty has the right to let you go.

209
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,220
You must go to the Secret Guards Department with me.

210
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,550
Then why did you save me?

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,450
-I...
-You...

212
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
-You...
-I...

213
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:28,930
I...

214
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,440
You...

215
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,440
I...

216
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,340
You're worried about me, aren't you?

217
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,740
Who's worried about you?

218
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,870
Shameless.

219
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,010
If you yelled just now,

220
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,990
the Secret Guards Department would have taken me away.

221
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,240
I... I just...

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,520
I wanted to take credit

223
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,880
for a promotion and a raise.

224
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,700
Oh, I see.

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,720
Falling flowers have intentions,

226
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,240
while flowing water

227
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,480
is indifferent.

228
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,920
What flowers and water?

229
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,370
I have no idea what you're talking about.

230
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,450
Do you know,

231
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,870
even though I knew it was a trap,

232
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,200
why did I still go there?

233
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,940
How would I know?

234
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,800
Anyway, I said it's up to you.

235
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,140
And you came.

236
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,740
It's my fault?

237
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,440
Of course.

238
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,880
You...

239
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,110
What are you doing?

240
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,550
I've received countless love letters on the Qixi Festival,

241
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,750
but I've never gone to any appointments.

242
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,240
Even though I knew it was a trap, but I went anyway.

243
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,470
Do you know why?

244
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,050
Why?

245
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,720
If you don't know why,

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,270
why is your heartbeat so fast?

247
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,560
Nonsense.

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,490
Don't you think we're a good match?

249
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
What match?

250
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,100
Everyone's heartbeat is the same, okay?

251
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,470
Is it?
