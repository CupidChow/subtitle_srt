00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,650
♫Last year's letters, I've read them countless times♫

187
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,430
I finally got you this time.

188
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm a fifth-rank chief.

189
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,690
♫Only to fulfill our appointment♫

190
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
How can you interrogate me like this?

191
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,030
♫To see you♫

192
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,470
Let go!

193
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
♫On the three-life stone, our fate is engraved♫

194
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,130
♫Circle around it♫

195
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,710
♫Love from the past life♫

196
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,760
♫Will my wish come true?♫

197
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,280
♫A glance from you♫

198
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,240
If you don't marry into my family,

199
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,150
♫Brought back all my memories of you♫

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,950
I...

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,260
I'll give you mute pills, ecstasy pills, and tickle pills.
