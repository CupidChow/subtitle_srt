4
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,560
I'll put the urine bucket here.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,370
Hurry up and use it. I'll collect it later.

6
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,040
I don't need it. Take it away.

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,330
No, you do.

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,560
Is it you?

9
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,810
Yes, it's me.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,970
Where are you?

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,410
Down here.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Down here.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,680
Yes. Yes.

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,010
This is me.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,950
Why are you here?

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,960
Time is running out. Let me get to the point.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,780
Don't worry.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,650
I will find a way to get you out.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,660
Shengu Feng is very scheming.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
You are no match for him.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,610
Leave me alone.

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,410
Leave now.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,170
Our country is in danger.

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,289
It's my best chance to get promoted.

25
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,410
How can I miss it?

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,410
Shi Jianchuan has betrayed you.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,960
If I hurt you and leave you,

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
you'll have a miserable ending.

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,450
I recruited Jianchuan myself.

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,970
He is pure and loyal.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,390
He wouldn't betray me.

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,850
I really don't understand

33
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,050
why he did that.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,570
Forget about him.

35
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,250
Let's figure out

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,050
how I can help you first.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,180
The priority now

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,729
is to expose the real identity of Shengu Feng.

39
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,170
Can you go to the God-Vanishing Valley?

40
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,539
God-Vanishing Valley?

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,120
It is said that it had been deserted

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,090
because of ghosts.

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,050
Shenggu Feng's martial arts are very suspicious.

44
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,100
I sent someone to investigate him.

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,919
Only God-Vanishing Valley has the Controlling Technique with Buddhist Music.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,520
By the way,

47
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,290
do you remember I was poisoned last time?

48
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,880
Yes.

49
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,450
What's wrong?

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,690
When I recall it now,

51
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,490
I think the poison wasn't from the dart.

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,750
He sprayed it instead.

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,890
This poison is called Cowherd Stamen.

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,840
Heartless Pollen is one of its ingredients.

55
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,450
It's only available in God-Vanishing Valley.

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,890
I'll go to the God-Vanishing Valley right away.

57
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,610
Fox, how are you? Are you alright?

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,770
I'm fine.

59
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,850
Stay here.

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,770
When I get you out,

61
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,610
you'll be my man.

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,200
You must be careful.

63
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,200
Don't force yourself when you encounter difficulties.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,130
There is nothing difficult for me.

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,610
Hey.

66
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,600
Why don't you encourage me?

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
How?

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,850
Kiss me.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,260
Kiss you?

70
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,560
You mean this one?

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,450
Of course.

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,370
I won't save you if you don't kiss me.

73
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,640
No. No.

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,170
Are you sure

75
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,090
no one used it before, right?

76
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,450
Of course not.

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,100
This is new.

78
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,090
If you don't kiss me, I'll...

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,850
Fine, I will.

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Fox.

81
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,570
You always lied to me.

82
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,690
I finally fooled you this time.

83
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,140
Your voice...

84
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,400
It's the Voice Transmission Skill of Meizhuang. How is it?

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,810
You've broadened your horizon, haven't you?

86
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,970
Yes.

87
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,750
Following these footprints,

88
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,480
we should be able to get inside.

89
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,920
Wait.

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,570
What is that?

91
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,750
Let's go.

92
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,250
Shi Jianchuan!

93
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,280
Miss Shiqi.

94
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,480
Jianchuan, aren't you in the imperial prison?

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,640
That's not me.

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,440
That's the Wolf Eagle Guard of Shengu Feng,

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Jian Qing.

98
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,610
Who are you?

99
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,700
We finally meet.

100
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,920
Brother.

101
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,450
You are... Jianqing?

102
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,640
My current name is Jian Qing.

103
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,159
When he was ten,

104
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,490
he went missing after he fell into the water.

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,350
We all thought he died.

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Unexpectedly...

107
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,690
This is my badge.

108
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,680
So it was you

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
who did all those things?

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,150
You know what?

111
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,659
It's quite efficient to have a brother

112
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,090
who serves that dumb Emperor as a guard.

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
Do you want to join us?

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,170
In this way, I don't have to pretend to be you

115
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,630
to assassinate him at tomorrow's ceremony.

116
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,890
Treason is a crime

117
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,910
unforgivable.

118
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,560
If you are willing to turn yourself in with me,

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,890
I can plead with Mr. Leng

120
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,670
to mitigate your punishment.

121
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,860
Sounds good.

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,400
But...

123
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,870
What?

124
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,390
How do you know I'm not the mastermind?

125
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,990
I wanted to persuade him to turn over a new leaf,

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
but he took advantage of me instead.

127
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,610
I'm sorry to His Majesty

128
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,290
and Lord Leng.

129
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm even more sorry for Her Highness.

130
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,250
I can only apologize with my death.

131
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Jianchuan.

132
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,820
It's a critical moment.

133
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,960
You can't die now!

134
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,570
The most important thing now

135
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,800
is to save Marquis Lu.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,080
Marquis Lu?

137
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,850
It's Leng Moyan.

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,770
We need your help now.

139
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,820
Mr. Shi,

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,650
do you know who the mastermind is?

141
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,020
Let's go.

142
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,070
Please hold him.

143
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's go.

144
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,400
Uncle Jing, have you recovered?

145
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

146
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,450
I feel much better.

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,630
I didn't expect that during the days I've been sick,

148
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,300
such a big change happened in the Investigation Bureau.

149
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,770
Marquis Lu deceived His Majesty and rebelled.

150
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,300
His crime is unforgivable.

151
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,300
Your Majesty, please decapitate him at the Gate Wu

152
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,560
as a warning to others.

153
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,320
Your Majesty, there are still many doubts in this case.

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,970
Please don't make a hasty judgment.

155
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,680
Your Highness,

156
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,680
you are so eager to defend Marquis Lu.

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,170
Are you his accomplice?

158
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,370
What?

159
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Are you trying to

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,060
make me frame others like you did?

161
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,800
I have evidence

162
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,960
to prove that you are close to the Investigation Bureau.

163
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,810
Just show it to us.

164
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,970
Your Majesty, please look at it.

165
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,730
You founded the Secret Guards Department,

166
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,810
whose whereabouts were hidden.

167
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,650
It's not under the jurisdiction of the three departments,

168
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,240
and engages in espionage and assassination independently.

169
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,570
The Lotus Pavilion where Luo Qingchen was

170
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,280
is your property, right?

171
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,940
So what?

172
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,810
Over the years, you've formed allied with many officials

173
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,640
in the form of business participation in Lotus Pavilion.

174
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,750
If it wasn't for a rebellion,

175
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,010
then why?

176
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,480
You...

177
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,500
Your Majesty, although I have some private property,

178
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,610
I didn't form cliques for personal gains.

179
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,960
Furthermore, I have no intention to rebel.

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,090
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
How dare you slander me!

182
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,650
Today I...

183
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,880
What? Do you want to hit me?

184
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,100
Yes, I will.

185
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,730
I have the Dragon Knife bestowed by the late emperor.

186
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,450
It only beats slanderers like you.

187
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,300
Today, I'll show you

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,980
what the law is!

189
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,360
Stop!

190
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,090
Prince Jing.

191
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,000
Old dog.

192
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,060
You deserved it.

193
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,880
Prince Jing.

194
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,850
Shengu Feng, you want to get rid of the Investigation Bureau,

195
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,430
and then destroy Prince Jing's Residence,

196
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,560
and finally, usurp the throne, right?

197
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,400
What a vicious scheme.

198
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,370
Miss Shiqi, I'm just an outsider.

199
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,170
I don't have the ambition and ability to plan for the throne.

200
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,210
Do you think I'll believe you?

201
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,800
Lord Yu Feng.

202
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,410
What did you say?

203
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
His name is Yu Feng?

204
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,410
That's right. He's not a priest,

205
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,270
and he didn't come from Silla.

206
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,010
This is the statement of Lord Jin Dongyan, the envoy of Silla.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,650
He received 10,000 taels of silver,

208
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,410
Please have a look, His Majesty.

209
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,410
and put on a show at Lord Lu's.

210
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,200
So his real identity

211
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,850
is the son of Duke Ning of the previous dynasty,

212
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,770
Yu Feng.

213
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,410
He's the son of the traitor, Yu Dingbang?

214
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,410
I thought he died.

215
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,050
After Yu Dingbang failed to rebel,

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,770
he fled to the God-Vanishing Valley

217
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,890
and colluded with Silla's evil forces

218
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,350
to develop the rebellion.

219
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,810
Two years ago, Yu Dingbang died of illness.

220
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,390
This power was transferred to

221
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,360
to his son, Yu Feng.

222
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,970
I planned to be gentle.

223
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,170
But now...

224
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,060
Let's just end it.

225
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,200
Take him down.

226
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,850
Listen.

227
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,400
If you don't let me out today,

228
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
I'll kill you.

229
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,950
Till now,

230
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,210
you still care about Marquis Lu?

231
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,650
Yes.

232
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,070
I've long believed that he's the one I love in this life.

233
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,600
I will love nobody in this world except him.

234
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,290
If you don't agree to this marriage,

235
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,400
I can guarantee

236
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,680
he will die in prison tonight.

237
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,260
You...

238
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,450
Not only him,

239
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,200
Emperor Yu, Prince Jing's family,

240
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,250
and the whole Secret Guards Department

241
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,720
will all be killed.

242
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,500
Think about it

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,940
♫The wind blows away the dust♫

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,020
♫To write my love letter on a peach petal♫

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,100
♫Flowers are as beautiful as colorful brocade, they only bloom for you♫

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,610
Don't you need someone to keep an eye on Miss Shiqi, Master?

247
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,840
The palace is surrounded by soldiers.

248
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,840
♫My love for you is beyond the words in the letter♫

249
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,920
Now,

250
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,250
the Investigation Bureau and the Secret Guards Department have been wiped out.

251
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,170
All the officials are ornaments.

252
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,570
As long as Marquis Lu is still in my hands,

253
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,620
♫The blue sea and sky are rare beauties in the world♫

254
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,880
she won't dare to do anything.

255
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,930
Yes.

256
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,800
♫It is the Eden♫
