[Episode 5 Meeting Enemies on Prince Jing's Birthday Banquet at His Residence]

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,010
Join the Investigation Bureau

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
and be my servant.

6
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,690
You...

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,870
You wish!

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Sounds like you don't want to return the favor.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,370
I definitely will!

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,490
When?

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,210
You have to make it clear today.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,760
We'll talk about it later.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,070
You must tell me now.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,400
Or, I'll pester you 24 hours a day.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,580
How can you talk like I did?

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,340
Do you have to be so aggressive?

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,300
He's abnormal, isn't he?

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,170
What do you think?

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,039
You're bullying me with your power!

20
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,570
I have no time to talk to you.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,340
Let's wait and see.

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,470
Make way for me.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,090
Take care.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,170
My lord,

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,490
it's a great idea

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,840
to gain the initiative.

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,110
But...

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,320
What?

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,420
It's just a bit unfair to her.

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,440
My lord,

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,910
you weren't like this before.

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,530
Come here.

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,039
What was I like before?

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,509
Before...

35
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,750
Who encouraged you

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,650
to comment on me like this?

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm sorry, my lord.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,860
Please forgive me.

39
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,810
Go get 20 canings.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Your Excellency.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,180
it's Prince Jing's birthday tomorrow.

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,840
There's an invitation sent from his residence.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,530
Prince Jing celebrates his birthday for 7-8 times every year.

44
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,350
He just wants to gather his followers

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,950
to plot something shameful.

46
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,670
Would it be a trap this time

47
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,670
that he suddenly invited you?

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Although the case of Consort Chen has been closed,

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,930
the real murderer hasn't been found yet.

50
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,290
Chen Bao was a servant of Prince Jing,

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,560
so Prince Jing was also involved.

52
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,040
Come with me to the banquet tomorrow.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
It's a good time to find clues there.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,090
Yes.

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,570
Mei Shiqi, you've done a great job in solving the case.

56
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,920
I hereby promote you

57
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,760
as the Commander of the Secret Guards Department.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,490
If I become the commander,

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,070
what about Mr. Jiang?

60
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,130
Jiang Bieyan?

61
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,210
He'll be your deputy then.

62
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,520
He's not as capable as you anyway.

63
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,490
Mr. Jiang, do you have any objections?

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
[Emperor Yu]

65
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,920
Your Majesty is wise.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,890
I'm sincerely convinced.

67
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,530
No objections.

68
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,280
Mei Shiqi.

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm going to give you a big reward.

70
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,430
What else do you want?

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,280
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,890
I want to choose a good man to marry into our Mei family.

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,690
Tell me about your requirements.

74
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,950
My matrilocal husband

75
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,970
must be a unique man in the world.

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,970
He's low-key and kind.

77
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,260
He's knowledgeable and easy-going.

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,570
His warm eyes

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,450
can diminish the warm sun in winter.

80
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,480
His sweet smile

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,530
can make Yanguai honey worthless.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
He is handsome

83
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,550
and well-educated.

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,880
He has a loving and caring heart.

85
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,130
Do you think anyone else

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,370
can meet your requirements other than me?

87
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,860
Then I'll be your matrilocal husband.

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,890
Your Majesty, it's inappropriate.

89
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,700
Why?

90
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,410
Mei Shiqi.

91
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,650
I've already fallen in love with you.

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Since you also have feelings for me,

93
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,170
Long,

94
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,029
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-get it done as soon as possible.

95
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,670
Yes.

96
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,540
Mr. Jiang,

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,080
no one

99
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,680
is against this marriage, right?

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
Yes.

101
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,330
Good.

102
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,680
I object.

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
It's not easy to get promoted

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,850
and marry the Emperor in my dreams.

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,890
What a bad ending!

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,070
Why am I holding a sword?

107
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,970
I fell asleep again?

108
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,710
Excuse me.

109
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,690
The Double Seventh Festival is around the corner.

110
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,150
There are so many couples.

111
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,730
Look at me.

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm so beautiful,

113
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,840
smart and brave.

114
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,830
When will I find a matrilocal husband?

115
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,380
Dear Xue, just buy me one.

116
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,140
[Wanted]

117
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,360
Xue Dong?

118
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,480
Let's go now.

119
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,670
Hi, do you think I'm beautiful?

120
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,690
[Xue Dong, an infamous thief]

121
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,130
Yes, you're very pretty.

122
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,460
Are you seeing someone?

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,690
No, I am still available.

124
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,670
-Go away!
-Dear Xue.

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm coming!

126
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,080
Make way for me!

127
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,120
Mei Shiqi!

128
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,840
You are still an intern!

129
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,390
But you've been neglecting your duty and late for work.

130
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,250
Answer me.

131
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you still respect me as your leader?

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,690
Master,

133
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,450
I've prepared a gift for you.

134
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,780
I'm sure you'll like it.

135
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,400
Can we keep a low profile?

136
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,210
Master, I can't keep a low profile about this.

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,970
Look.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,660
Look.

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,970
Look.

140
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,330
Xue Dong!

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,070
That's right.

142
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,410
This is Xue Dong,

143
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,160
who has stolen from 13 merchants in Luoyang.

144
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,970
The Investigation Bureau

145
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,930
failed to catch him during these three years.

146
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,930
With my persistence,

147
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,800
I've been lurking from morning to night,

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and being late for work and leaving early all the time.

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,370
Finally, I arrested him.

150
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,960
Mei Shiqi, aren't you...

151
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,490
Master,

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,450
you know me.

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,350
For the peace of the world

154
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,800
and the happiness of the people,

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
I can bear all the sufferings

156
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,930
and misunderstandings alone.

157
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,480
The spirit of Secret Guards will last forever.

158
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Did you see that?

159
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,320
Did you all see that?

160
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,570
This is the spirit of the Secret Guards Department.

161
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,010
Of course, it's me who recognized your talent

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,400
and promoted you.

163
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,520
Master.

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,050
Yes?

165
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,710
Will you consider giving me a regular position?

166
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,770
I'll approve it.

167
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,830
Thank you, Master.

168
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,700
Let's get down to business.

169
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,240
His Majesty will attend

170
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,600
Prince Jing's birthday banquet.

171
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,520
Besides the Imperial Guards,

172
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,320
our Secret Guards Department must be on high alert

173
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,680
to protect His Majesty.

174
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,850
We must be cautious.

175
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,150
Do you understand?

176
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,610
Yes.

177
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,130
-Secret Guards of Mei Manor. -For world peace!

178
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,960
The spirit of the Secret Guards...

179
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,330
Will last forever!

180
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,590
All right, come here.

181
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,290
Wang Wu, you take charge of the front hall.

182
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,750
Yes.

183
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,570
Long Qi, you take charge of the back hall.

184
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:48,900
Okay.

185
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,730
Chen Shiyi, you're good at flying.

186
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,530
You're in charge of the roof area.

187
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:51,840
Yes.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,730
Zhen Shisan.

189
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,890
Let's protect His Majesty closely.

190
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,570
Get ready, everyone.

191
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,830
What about me, Master?

192
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,350
Your present rank is low.

193
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,690
You'd better not join this time.

194
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,150
Why can't I go with you?

195
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,860
You are always careless.

196
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,020
If you alarm His Majesty,

197
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,360
all of us will be implicated.

198
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,490
But I want to protect His Majesty, too.

199
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,410
I'll be scared if I stay here alone at night.

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,930
Are you serious?

201
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll be grateful

202
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,730
if you don't demolish our office.

203
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,240
I'll be scared.

204
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,220
Right, Shisan?

205
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,090
How about

206
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,520
letting her go with us?

207
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,210
Something bad may happen

208
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,670
if we leave her here alone.

209
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,690
That's right.

210
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,260
Okay, you can take care of this place.

211
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,370
Where is this? It looks a bit far from the front hall.

212
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,490
Will His Majesty go there?

213
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,289
Then why did you let me guard there?

215
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,330
You can either guard there or stay here.

216
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm not going there!

217
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,289
It's up to you.

218
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,370
Okay, it's a deal.

219
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:49,960
Let's go.

220
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,970
You must go.

221
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,200
I won't go.

222
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,930
So annoying.

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
Greetings, Mr. Leng.

224
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,480
It's my honor that

225
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
you are able to

226
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,920
attend my birthday banquet.

227
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,180
Happy birthday and have a long life, Your Highness.

228
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,330
I'm aged.

229
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,190
I'm just relying on His Majesty's blessings

230
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,080
and grace to live a peaceful life.

231
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,520
You are young and promising.

232
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,600
I feel relieved

233
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,590
that you can guard our nation.

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,250
Father.

235
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,880
Father, where is Lord Leng?

236
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,720
Xiu'er, stop messing around.

237
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,000
This is Chief Leng.

238
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,540
Mr. Leng, this is my daughter, Nangong Xiu'er.

239
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

240
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,950
Greetings, Moyan.

241
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,140
Xiu'er, since you came,

242
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,890
please take care of Mr. Leng on behalf of me.

243
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,410
What are you doing there?

244
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,110
Invite Moyan to take a seat.

245
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Don't bother.

246
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,520
My nature calls.

247
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,130
It's been a long time, Mr. Liu.

248
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,790
Jianchuan.

249
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:13,840
Yes.

250
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,310
Accompany Her Highness.

251
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,360
My lord.

252
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,290
Moyan.

253
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,520
Is that so?

254
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Yes.

255
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,630
You're right, Your Highness.

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,580
Enjoy the wine and treasures.

257
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,530
So elegant.

258
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,310
I'll be mad if you don't stop the camouflage.

259
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,850
Why are you sneaking here?

260
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Come with me to see Prince Jing.

261
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
I need to go to the toilet.

262
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,530
Stop pretending.

263
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,610
The place you just came from is the toilet.

264
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,340
Come with me to see Prince Jing.

265
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,030
Moyan.

266
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,340
What are you doing here?

267
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,010
I...

268
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,970
Who are you?

269
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,480
Your Highness,

270
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm Mei Shiqi from the Secret Guards Department.

271
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,050
Mei Shiqi?

272
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,520
Yes.

273
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,800
Who is she?

274
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,050
It doesn't matter.

275
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,170
She's just a junior secret guard

276
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,030
who has admired me for a long time.

277
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,750
Who has a crush on you?

278
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,490
Can you stop lying?

279
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,290
What do you mean?

280
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,770
Who was it on the street that day?

281
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,880
I was forced by...

282
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,930
You were attracted by my charm?

283
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,240
So you are that lady.

284
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,270
I advise you to think it over.

285
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,610
Don't have any improper feelings for Moyan.

286
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,210
Don't worry, Your Highness.

287
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,590
I have no improper feelings for him at all.

288
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,170
You have no idea, Your Highness.

289
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,090
He is actually...

290
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,650
My lord,

291
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,150
His Majesty is coming.

292
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,260
Be careful, Your Highness.

293
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,250
He's indeed the perfect prince charming in the hearts of thousands of girls.

294
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,920
Are you kidding me, Your Highness?

295
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,960
I was the first one to protect you.

296
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,980
Can't you see

297
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,390
the burning spirit of the Secret Guards?

298
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Moyan.

299
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,200
Let's get out of here.

300
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,490
Poor princess.

301
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,810
Don't you know he's an eunuch?

302
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:54,770
Come on.

303
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,540
Your Excellencies.

304
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,130
Come on.

305
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,940
Uncle Jing.

306
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,880
Yes?

307
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:21,320
♫The wind blows away the dust♫

308
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,840
This song is quite beautiful.

309
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,840
Why haven't I listened to it before?

310
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,400
♫To write my love letter on a peach petal♫

311
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,640
Your Majesty, this is...

312
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,790
Your Majesty,

313
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,630
this song has vanished for many years.

314
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,310
I accidentally found it in a legacy book in the folks.

315
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,480
♫Flowers are as beautiful as colorful brocade, they only bloom for you♫

316
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,240
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang missed Consort Yang.

317
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,080
They could even visit the Moon Palace

318
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,490
in their dreams.

319
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,220
♫My love for you is beyond the words in letter♫

320
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,930
Unfortunately,

321
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,770
Consort Chen and I were separated forever by death.

322
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:49,000
♫The blue sea and sky are rare beauties in the world♫

323
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm afraid

324
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,360
we'll never meet again.

325
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,180
♫It is the eden♫

326
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,370
♫This feeling will become a memory to be cherished♫

327
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,550
♫Each string, each stop, bears thought of vanished things♫

328
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,610
♫The love letter on the peach petal I gave you♫

329
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,150
♫And my love will never change♫

330
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,500
♫My pure love can stand the test of time♫

331
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,210
Ghost!
