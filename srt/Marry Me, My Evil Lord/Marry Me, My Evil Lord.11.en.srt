[Episode 11: Shengu Feng fell for Mei Shiqi]

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,750
It's me.

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,230
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm investigating the case.

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,300
See?

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,440
They're the Wolf Eagle Guards.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's go.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,670
They are here!

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,830
Go! Hurry!

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,380
Go!

[Priest Shengu Feng]

14
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,030
Priest, why are you here?

15
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,870
There was once a northern beauty.

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,270
The one and only on earth.

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,220
To her first glance, a city fell captive.

18
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,680
To her second glance, a nation fell captive.

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,910
O Whatever, however.

20
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,710
Never ever another her.

21
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,670
Hurry. This way.

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,380
Come on.

23
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,780
Mr. Leng, why are you so panic?

24
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,500
There are villains going after us.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,829
Priest, find a place to hide.

26
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm a Taoist.

27
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,829
I can't just leave you to die.

28
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,710
You go first.

29
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,070
I'll persuade them.

30
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,660
They are vicious.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,700
How can you persuade them with just a few words?

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,030
Such a fool.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,660
Find a place to hide.

34
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,070
Mr. Leng, who is this?

35
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,990
This is Mei Shiqi from the Secret Guards Department.

36
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,590
Nice to meet you, Miss Shiqi.

37
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,200
I heard that

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,390
the Investigation Bureau and the Secret Guards Department

39
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,720
are always on bad terms.

40
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,710
I didn't expect you two to protect each other

41
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,770
and stay together.

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,900
It seems that rumours are not true.

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,630
It's a blessing to the country.

44
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,770
Alright, stop nagging.

45
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,770
Do you want to die?

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,490
This way.

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,380
Noble acquaintances.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,780
I'm Shengu Feng, the Priest of the Yu State.

49

Today is sunny

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,670

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,380
You shouldn't kill anyone.

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,620
Gentlemen, why don't you let them go?

53
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,710
You can follow me to Shuiyun Residence to study Taoism

54
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,870
and cultivate your minds, okay?

55
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,030
Stupid man.

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,500
Kill them all!

57
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,770
Watch out, Priest!

58
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,690
I never thought

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,890
there would be such a woman in the world.

60
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
Thank you for saving my life.

61
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,880
Noble acquaintances, put down your knives.

62

Priest,

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,580
I didn't expect strong magic power

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,780
from your handsome appearance.

65
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,640
You flatter me.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,820
I want to thank you for saving my life several times.

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,750
You're welcome.

68
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,430

Let's go.

72
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,620
What's wrong?

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,600
The dart was poisoned.

74
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,960
Let me take you to a clinic. Come on.

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
No.

76
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,920
Your colleagues are looking for me.

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
I can't go.

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,880
Then let's go to my house.

79
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,740
There's a cave ahead.

80
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,390
It's our special hideout.

81
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,120
I have the antidote to all poisons.

82
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,150
Okay.

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,990
Let's go.

84
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,890
Where did he go?

85
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,820
Prisoner's getting away. Stop!

86
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
You, search this way.

87
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,650
You, over there!

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,160
Your Highness.

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,730
Your Highness.

90
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,790
Uncle Liu.

91
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,420
What is it?

92
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,190
A prisoner escaped from the Investigation Bureau.

93
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,380
I heard he climbed over the wall and entered the residence.

94
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,260
Are you okay?

95
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,909
I'm fine.

96
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,230
I don't think he dares to come in here.

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,460
Good.

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,390
Donâ€™t worry.

99
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,030
We will guard the place

100
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,070
and catch the man.

101
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,730
Come on. Keep searching.

102
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,700
Deputy Shi.

103
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,860
Did Moyan tell you to find me?

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,920
What's the matter?

105
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,700
Your Highness, Mr. Leng is wanted by the Secret Guards Department.

106
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,980
They said he killed the female offender who ambushed His Majesty.

107
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Now he's the suspect of assassination and rebellion.

108
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,430
I just escaped from prison

109
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,590
to save him.

110
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,100
No, I have to find my father.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,500
Your Highness, you can't tell Prince Jing.

112
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,950
I have an idea.

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Be confident.

114
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,700
You can't let anyone here find you.

115
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,200
Let's go.

116
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,790
You...

117
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,980
Hurry up.

118
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,470
What a beautiful girl.

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,580
Your Highness, please don't make fun of me.

120
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,270
Put your hands down.

121
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Put them down.

122
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,990
Come on.

123
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,430
Master.

124
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,980

You.

126
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,020
Why are you here to disturb me?

127
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,330
I'm here to ask for your help.

128
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,060
Please help me this time.

129
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,210
Who is this man?

130
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,060
What's his relationship to you?

131
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,700
Don't worry. He's not a bad guy.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,650
I came to you this time

133
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,230
because of him.

134
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,130
Deputy Shi.

Greetings, Priest.

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,150
Tell me,

140
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,370
what trouble did you get into this time?

141
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,630
Fox, how are you feeling?

142
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,090
Wake up, where did you put the medicine?

143
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,650
Where is the medicine?

144
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,490
Your clothes are wet.

145
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,830
You have to change,

146
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,070
catching a cold will make it harder.

147
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,310
Let me make it clear.

148
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,580
I'm not peeping anything.

149
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,420
Ahh!

150
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,050
What is it?
