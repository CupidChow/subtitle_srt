00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,070
Are your acupuncture points unlocked?

5
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,670
Of course.

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,890
Is the Secret Guards Department so ungrateful?

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,200
I saved you just now.

8
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,510
Cut the crap.

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,230
If it weren't for your disability but firmness,

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,090
I would have stabbed you to death.

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,360
Where is my clothes?

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,230
Gosh.

13
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,740
Take it back.

14
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,240
The front yard is full of guards,

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
while the backyard is full of traps.

16
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,830
You can't get out without my help.

17
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,030
Guess what I found under your pillow?

18
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,560
The trap map.

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,620
This is the top secret of the Investigation Bureau.

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,310
Give it back to me.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,440
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,400
How credible are his words?

23
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,850
Is the Bureau related to Consort Chen's death?

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,250
Lord, I'm going to get the trap map.

25
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,350
How's the investigation going?

26
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,030
I've inquired about Consort Chen's family.

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,460
Nothing suspicious was found.

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,900
I've already set up traps

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
in Consort Chen's chamber.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,140
No one can decode them.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,510
We're also following up on other clues.

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,930
Looks like it's not that easy to solve it.

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,150
There will be unexpected progress

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,030

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,710
My lord,

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,230
it's not like your style.

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,120
What's my style?

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,880
Cold and indifferent.

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,810
Proud and aloof.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,100
You've made great decisions

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,430
and acted arbitrarily.

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,300
You will never let others help

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,390
if you can settle a matter by yourself.

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm hungry. Buy some food for me.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,010
Which restaurant do you want to eat from?

46
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,550
Okay.

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,270
Is Leng Moyan really a eunuch?

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,030
Was I fooled?

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,790
He is a eunuch.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,230
Who?

51
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,920
Me.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,140
Senior Shisan, what are you doing here at night?

53
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,070
You freak me out.

54
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,780
I am on a mission.

55
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,540
Do you think I am taking a break?

56
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,070
What mission?

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,910
Everyone knows it. Don't you know?

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,500
Why are you here, Senior Qi?

59
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Leng Moyan is a eunuch,

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,930
that's why he's arrogant, evil

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,150
and cunning.

62
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,829
He's a psychopath.

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,250
He

64
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,630
is not as bad as you said.

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,870
I think...

66
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,250
Stop thinking.

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,520

Jump over the trap.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Why do I feel something is wrong?

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,030
Why did the killer kill Consort Chen who is incapable of resisting

81
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,310
by so many methods, slashing her wrist,

82
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,070
using Eagle Claw Skill, and even strangling?

83
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,710
Is the killer trying to cover up something?

84
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,230
Why is there so much dust?

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
White silk.

86
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,330
I see.

87
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,820
Consort Chen hanged herself.

88
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,980
Someone fabricated the crime scene

89
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,710
to mislead the investigation.

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
He wants to use her death to plot something.

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,190

92
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,390

It would be great if you handsome guy weren't a eunuch.

Your Highness.

I came to ask you something.

158
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,190
Go ahead.

159
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,830
I heard you went to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts.

160
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,740
What did you learn?

161
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,510
You know that?

162
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,780
I once learned Skanda Palm and Bodhi Knife Skill

163
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,270
from the head of Arhat Hall.

164
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,270
Is there anything wrong?

165
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,840
Haven't you learned Eagle Claw Skill and King Kong Palm?

166
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,740
No. What's the matter?

167
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,590
Your shoulder was wounded yesterday, right?

168
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,550
How did you know

169
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,060
my shoulder was hurt?

your right hand has never moved.

172
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,350
The way you hold the cup with your left hand is clumsy.

173
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,470
So I guess your right shoulder was hurt.

174
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,080
How dare you!

175
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,760

Where have you been? You haven't recovered yet.

188
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
No.

189
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm fine now.

190
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,540
Look.

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,150
Where did you go?

192
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,070
I went out for something.

193
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,030
Are you worried about me?

194
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,310
I'm not.

195
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,430
I just want to thank you

196
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,030
as you saved me.

197
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,380
I don't believe it.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,330
Or why are you blushing?

199
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,270
Am I blushing? No.

200
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,660
It's hot.

201
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,790
Is it so hard to admit that you like me?

202
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,870
I...

203
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,270
I don't like you.

204
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,410
Then, what should I do?

205
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,140
Because I like you very much.

206
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,630
Liar.

207
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,670
Then, I'll

208
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,700
prove it to you.
