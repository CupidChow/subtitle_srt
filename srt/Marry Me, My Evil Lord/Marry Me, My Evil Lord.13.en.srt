4
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,100
Mr. Shi.

5
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,140
Your Highness.

6
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,800
I brought you a bowl of tonics.

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,080
Have some more.

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,220
Sit down.

9
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,300
This is too precious.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,050
You got hurt to save me.

11
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,540
These tonics are nothing.

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,540
Eat up.

13
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,890
Thank you.

14
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,260
Moyan.

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,120
You escaped from Mei Shiqi?

16
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,530
Your Highness, why are you with Jianchuan?

17
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,090
Here's the thing.

18
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,090
I asked Her Highness to find you.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,560
What's your relationship with Shengu Feng?

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,890
He is my master.

21
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,350
He also helped me find you.

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,860
Are you fine right now?

23
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,820
It's just a minor injury.

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm incompetent.

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,740
Please forgive me.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,170
It's okay. You can rest for a few days more.

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,320
I'll handle Luo Qingchen's case.

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,050
Yes.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,810
Moyan.

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,690
You're a little late today.

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,460
Cut the crap!

32
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,260
I won't let you run away today.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,140
Come back to the Secret Guards Department with me.

34
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,000
No need to rush.

35
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,050
Take a look at this first.

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,050
What is this?

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,960
The strange poison from the Western Region that killed Luo Qingchen.

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,700
I found it in Jianchuan's room.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,430
You're investigating him too?

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,870
Now that we have found solid evidence,

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,420
can we arrest him and close the case now?

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,860
No.

43
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,860
This proves that someone is framing him.

44
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,220
If Jianchuan had killed Luo Qingchen,

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,090
he wouldn't have left any evidence.

46
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,110
What if he wants you to think that way?

47
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,830
After all, you are the closest person to him

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,210
in the world.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,790
He knows you the best.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,700
He won't.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,820
Why are you so sure?

52
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,650
Because I know his character.

53
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,220
Do you know that what's on a person's face

54
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,329
is not always what's in their heart?

55
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,260
Give me the evidence.

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,190
I'll arrest him.

57
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,850
You trust me that much?

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Are you not afraid that I'll lie to you again?

59
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,420
Who trusts you?

60
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,940
It's the evidence I trust.

61
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,050
I'd arrest you if the evidence pointed at you.

62
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,180
You can't arrest me,

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,260
and you can't take me back to the Secret Guards Department.

64
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,090
Why?

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,060
Because of this.

[Imperial Edict]

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,370
Leng, are you sure that Luo Qingchen

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,740
was the female thief who attacked me?

69
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,020
She was ordered by the head of the Wolf Eagle Guards

70
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,130
to pretend to assassinate you.

71
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,860
In fact, she was trying to sow discord between me and Prince Jing

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,250
and weaken the power of the court

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,290
to clear the obstacles for himself.

74
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,940
Mr. Leng, do you have any evidence

75
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,490
to prove that Luo Qingchen wasn't killed by yourself?

76
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,660
Your Majesty,

77
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,220
I... can't prove my innocence at this moment.

78
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,060
But please give me a few more days

79
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,340
to prove my innocence.

80
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,579
His Majesty agreed?

81
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,019
What else?

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
Are you...

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,690
trustworthy?

84
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,420
I have my own way.

85
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,300
It’s not something a junior secret guard like you

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,160
can speculate.

87
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,580
You...

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,770
Then why did you transfer me

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,130
to be your personal guard?

90
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,820
Jianchuan is too involved in the case.

91
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,890
Plus, he is injured and unable to fulfill his duty.

92
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,740
I need

93
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,970
a capable and reliable assistant.

94
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,310
Besides,

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,730
with my charm,

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,340
it's easy

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,850
to ask for a personal guard from His Majesty.

98
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,900
You're so narcissistic even in front of His Majesty.

99
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,280
You are really

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,630
the most narcissistic man I’ve ever seen.

101
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,740
I’m still better than

102
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,940
some flirtatious priest.

103
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,420
Not necessarily.

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,380
Master Feng is on another level

105
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,010
compared to you.

106
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,860
Like Chang'an Street versus some small alley.

107
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,320
Master Feng? You know him that well?

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,130
Of course.

109
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,690
After you ran away that time,

110
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,620
I had a deep conversation with him.

111
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,330
In my heart,

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,780
he is

113
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,340
an elegant and scholarly

114
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,290
gentleman.

115
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,720
You...

116
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,780
Did you

117
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,620
agree to his proposal?

118
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
That's right.

119
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,409
Unfortunately, you left too early

120
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,659
and missed that sweet scene.

121
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,600
He is cunning and evil.

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
His hair is white and he looks like an old man.

123
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,060
He doesn't look like a good man at first sight.

124
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,450
How could you agree so easily?

125
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,380
You don't like me.

126
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,909
It's none of your business.

127
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,530
Who said I don't like you?

128
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,490
You are a cunning rogue

129
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,170
full of lies.

130
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,340
I won't believe a word you say.

131
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,560
Then why do you

132
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,550
always believe me?

133
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,940
When did I ever trust you?

134
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,250
Your words are not credible.

135
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,900
Stop lying to yourself.

136
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,330
Although you insult me every day,

137
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,940
deep down,

138
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,650
you must think

139
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,250
I'm the most reliable gentleman

140
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,220
in the world.

141
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,820
You are a gentleman?

142
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,920
Then there are no despicable people

143
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,650
in this world.

144
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,730
I'm just too kind

145
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,140
and naive,

146
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,060
which is why I was blinded

147
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,750
and fell into your trap.

148
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,220
You don't like me at all?

149
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,830
Totally, absolutely,

150
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,190
and completely.

151
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,470
What a coincidence.

152
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,340
I happen to need someone

153
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,620
who is kind and naive,

154
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,210
who

155
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,750
is charmed by me

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,300
but doesn't like me at all

157
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,910
To be my guard.

158
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,970
Kneel for the imperial edict.

159
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,470
You...

160
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,990
Go home and move your stuff here today.

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Why should I move my stuff here?

162
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,340
You're my personal bodyguard.

163
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,650
Not only do you have to serve me,

164
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,730
but you also have to protect me 24 hours a day.

165
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,340
Of course, we should live together.

166
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,220
Leng Moyan.

167
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,140
You...

168
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,250
What exactly do you want?

169
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,450
Don't worry.

170
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,930
There are two rooms in this bedroom.

171
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,460
You will sleep in that room.

172
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,550
Well,

173
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,860
was Mr. Shi treated like this before?

174
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,960
Mr. Shi?

175
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,050
He’s a man.

176
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,840
It's not convenient for him to live here.

177
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,900
A man.

178
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,690
It's not convenient for two men to live here?

179
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,100
It's convenient for me, a girl,

180
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,660
to live here?

181
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
Leng Moyan is an eunuch,

182
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,410
right?

183
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,540
Don't worry.

184
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,650
Although I'm not a eunuch,

185
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,450
I promise you

186
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,419
that I won't do anything to you.

187
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,380
Unless

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,850
you want to become a true eunuch.

189
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,090
Where did you steal my flower scissors?

190
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,440
Your flower scissors?

191
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,310
Or where did you get it?

192
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,290
Fine.

193
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,390
You'll be my deputy from now on.

194
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,340
Could you please be gentler?

195
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,980
You're not tall,

196
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,980
but you're rude and fierce.

197
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,850
I just want to say

198
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,940
that you could be a bit gentler.

199
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,480
Yes.

200
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,020
Go to bed now and take a nap.

201
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,020
Maybe I'll be gentle in your dream.

202
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,840
I've dreamed about it. Nothing  happened.

203
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,260
How is it?

204
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,840
From now on,

205
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,620
this is the office we share.

206
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,050
This

207
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,210
is the Nanmu writing desk

208
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,910
I specifically asked someone to make for you.

209
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,120
Like it?

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,060
Nanmu writing desk?

211
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,530
This is fancy stuff that even my master is coveting.

212
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,330
Looks like he cares about me a lot.

213
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,710
It's a good desk.

214
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,410
But as a humble deputy,

215
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,370
I use something fancier than yours.

216
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,610
Is it inappropriate?

217
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,460
If I don't take it seriously,

218
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,750
how can I let you know

219
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,480
your place

220
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,720
and significance in my heart?

221
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,810
Since you care so much about me,

222
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,150
I'll be

223
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,990
nice to you in the future.

224
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,500
My lord, these are the official documents you need to take care of today.

225
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,080
Got it.

226
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,340
Bring Deputy Mei's documents too.

227
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes.

228
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,670
The Investigation Bureau is busy.

229
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,860
The deputy has a great deal of responsibility to shoulder.

230
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,840
A small desk

231
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,050
won’t be enough for stacks of documents.

232
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,780
Thank you.
