actually sent such a rookie to deal with us.

189
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,650
There must be a conspiracy behind this.

190
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,900
Be careful.

191
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,550
Yes.

192
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,090
Leng Moyan is truly sinister.

193
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,820
I can't defeat him on my own.

194
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,320
Shisan.

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,490
Help me, please.

196
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,750
Shiqi, it's not that I don't want to help you.

197
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,750
Let me tell you,

198
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,980
I have responsibilities with my parents and kids.

199
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
If they target me,

200
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,820
how can I ensure the safety of my family?

201
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,560
Aren't you an orphan?

202
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,560
Haven't you been single for 30 years?

203
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,540
How can you have parents and kids?

204
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,340
Shhh.

205
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,770
Keep your voice down.

206
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,080
Shisan, I bought this for you. Give it a try.

207
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,090
This...

208
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,550
or this... This.

209
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,610
Actually, Leng Moyan

210
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,060
has a weakness.

211
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,540
If we make good use of it,

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,150
it might work.

213
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,450
What is it?

214
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,460
Eat.

215
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,740
You've followed me for two blocks. What do you want?

216
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,830
I was wrong yesterday.

217
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,890
Is there anything else?

219
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,950
If not, I have something to attend to.

220
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Well,

221
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,710
I want to invite you for a meal as an apology.

222
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,150
Are you available?

223
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,540
No, I'm not.

224
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,550
Watch out!

225
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,860
Who is it?
