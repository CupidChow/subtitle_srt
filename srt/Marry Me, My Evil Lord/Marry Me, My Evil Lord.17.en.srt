1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,030
Have a look.

3
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,690
50 pennies.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
There must be something wrong with Shengu Feng.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,820
Did you find any clues in his file?

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,770
Mr. Leng,

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,110
we've read the files many times.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,530
There is nothing wrong.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,150
Did you find anything from the surveillance?

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,110
Could he be a spy from Xinluo?

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,150
He just

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,960
communicated with His Majesty about self-cultivation skills,

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
and sometimes brought ginseng,

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,110
pilos antler and other mountain products from Goryeo to His Majesty.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,790
They never talked about national affairs.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,750
But we can't rule out his suspicion.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,960
Have you ever seen a man from Xinluo

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,950
speak such a standard common language of Yu?

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,750
Besides, have you seen him speak Xinluo language?

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
No.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Shengu Feng,

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,350
no matter how deep you hide,

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,840
I'll uncover your actual color.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,230
It's my honor to have Mr. Shengu

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,760
in my banquet.

26
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,120
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
You let someone tell me that if I don't come,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,729
you wouldn't return the pearl,

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,780
so it's hard for me to say no to you.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,560
I thought that

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,350
Mr. Jin and Mr. Shengu have lived in Yu for a long time.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,509
It must have been a long time since you met your fellow villagers.

33
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,710
So I invited you two

34
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,229
to have a chat

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,950
to relieve the pain of homesickness.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,510
Does Mr. Shengu come from Xinluo?

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Yes.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,350
I heard that Mr. Shengu is knowledgeable.

39
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,750
I believe you're famous in Xinluo.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,520
You flatter me. I haven't returned to my hometown for years.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,030
I'm afraid no one knows me anymore.

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Our Priest is named Shengu Feng.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,430
Have you heard of his name in Xinluo?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,750
Well,

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,310
you are Mr. Shengu Feng.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,240
I didn't recognize you.

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,210
Please forgive me.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,760
No formality required. Please have a seat.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,000
You haven't returned to Xinluo for years,

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,750
but there's always a legend about you.

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,079
It's my honor

52
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,000
to meet you today.

53
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,120
It's a false reputation.

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,240
You flatter me, Mr. Jin.

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,590
Yes.

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,710
Is she Mei Shiqi, the legendary beauty of Yu

57
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,400
who made you fall in love at first sight?

58
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,000
Legendary beauty?

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,960
Why? Is she also well-known in Xinluo?

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
Of course.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,430
More than that.

63
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,360
The whole country is talking about her.

64
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,010
Everyone is wondering

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,910
what kind of girl

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,450
can make you, such a self-possessed man,

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
fall in love.

68
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,710
Now I see you,

69
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,000
you are indeed

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,290
charming and gorgeous.

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
You flatter me.

72
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,840
Actually...

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,750
Miss Shiqi,

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
and my lord, I have a request.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I happen to bring a superior ginseng from Changbai Mountain.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,360
On behalf of the people of Xinluo, I will present it to Miss Shiqi

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,420
to show my respect.

78
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,750
Your marriage with Mr. Shengu

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,910
is a symbol of the friendly diplomatic relations

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,520
between Xinluo and Yu.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
Please accept it.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,190
No.

83
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,040
We're not a couple.

84
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm in charge of protecting him.

85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,950
It's okay.

86
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,830
I'm willing to submit a letter to the emperors of two countries for your marriage.

87
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,630
No need.

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,830
Thank you

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,510
for your kindness, Mr. Jin.

90
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,950
But we still have time to discuss it.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,510
There's no rush.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,720
I have something to deal with at home.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,510
I'll have a drink with you another day.

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
See you.

96
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,720
See you, Mr. Jin.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Leng.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Miss Shiqi and I need to go back.

99
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,600
Fox, we haven't seen each other for three days.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,630
Can't you chase me and talk to me?

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,630
Ding.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Isn't Mr. Leng in the office?

103
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,430
Sir,

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,040
Mr. Leng had a banquet with Mr. Shengu and the envoy of Xinluo.

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,600
He just sent them away.

106
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't you know about this?

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,310
Okay. Go back to work.

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes.

109
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,170
Your Highness,

110
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,950
why are you here alone?

111
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,430
Mr. Shi,

112
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,530
have a seat.

113
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,190
Shi Jianchuan,

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,040
do you think I'm awful?

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
Your Highness, you are

116
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
beautiful and intelligent.

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,890
I think you are the most outstanding lady.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,310
Why do you ask so?

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,950
I've been looking for Moyan three times,

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,690
but he wasn't there.

121
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,560
Do you think he is deliberately avoiding me?

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,630
We are in the same situation.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,680
What?

124
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,120
Is your loved one avoiding you?

125
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,000
Who?

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

127
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,040
Mr. Leng can't see your merit,

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,950
but someone will treat you as a treasure

129
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,409
and acknowledge you as the best in the world.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,510
Where is that guy?

131
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,560
You look handsome today.

132
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,190
Why didn't I notice it before?

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,120
What?

134
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,410
Are you going to meet your beloved?

135
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,750
No, you are not allowed to leave.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,750
You have to drink with me today.

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,560
Sir, get him a bowl.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,560
Okay.

139
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,560
Here.

140
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,020
Your Highness.

141
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,950
Cheers.

142
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,390
Let's go.

143
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
I'm doomed.

144
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,720
Wait,

145
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,190
this is my house.

146
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,320
Mr. Leng.

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Mr. Leng, I came back.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,750
What happened?

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,200
According to the spies of the Chaoyang Branch,

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,790
the rebels led by the Master are secretly engaged in activities in the capital and

151
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,450
planning to assassinate His Majesty tomorrow.

152
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,270
Tomorrow?

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
His Majesty will meet the Persian envoy, who will return home tomorrow.

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
Could it be...

155
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
The A-battalion,

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
put every branch on a Class-A alert.

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Keep a close eye on all suspicious people.

158
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,220
No mistake is allowed.

159
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,770
Yes, sir!

160
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,690
Other departments

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,060
should do the same.

162
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,150
Action!

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,550
Yes, sir!

164
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,510
Mr. Leng, what should I do?

165
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,960
You don't have to get involved in this case.

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,550
Go back to enjoy your day off.

167
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,320
Sir,

168
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,210
you don't even allow me to participate in such a critical case.

169
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,790
Are you still suspecting that I'm not loyal

170
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
and collude with the rebels?

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,630
I'm protecting you.

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,910
Do you know

173
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,360
you're already involved?

174
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,790
What do you mean?

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,360
On the night Luo Qingchen was murdered,

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,170
have you ever been to my office?

177
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,600
No.

178
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
Chen Chong saw you go into my office.

179
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,090
How dare you deny it?

180
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,790
I don't know why Chen Chong framed me.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm willing to confront him.

182
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,630
Chen Chong is missing.

183
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,030
How can you confront him?

184
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,990
When?

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,910
After

186
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,750
he told me you had been to my office.

187
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,910
Sir,

188
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,720
god knows

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
my loyalty.

190
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,960
If you don't trust me,

191
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm willing to cut my throat

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
to prove my innocence.
