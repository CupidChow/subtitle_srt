[Episode 6; A View in the Bathroom]

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Ghost!

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,840
Help! Help!

6
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,910
Protect His Majesty!

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,880
Protect His Majesty!

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,820
Your Majesty, I died miserably.

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,110
You must avenge my death.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,830
You are...

11
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,670
Consort Chen.

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,970
Dear.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
Your Majesty.

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,670
Dear, Chen Bao, the person who forced you to die has been executed.

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,820
What more grievances do you have?

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,210
Chen Bao was just a puppet.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,950
The real murderer is someone else.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,289
Who?

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,390
It's him.

20
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:26,810
You...

21
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,450
He ordered Chen Bao to kill me

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,160
in order to create chaos in the court

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,020
and seize the opportunity to usurp power!

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,020
How dare you!

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,450
How dare you slander my father!

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,580
Xiu'er, be careful.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,280
His Majesty won't believe this person appearing out of nowhere

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,680
and her deceitful words.

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,570
Dear.

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,900
Even if what you said is true,

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,100
there is no evidence.

32
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,700
How can I...

33
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,340
You, fickle and foolish man.

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,380
You'd rather believe in treacherous officials

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,620
than me.

36
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,230
God will punish you.

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,770
Hahaha.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,940
Get her!

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,430
Xiu'er.

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,729
While they are

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,940
all enjoying life with His Majesty in the hall,

42
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,500
let me feed mosquitoes alone in this yard.

43
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,350
That's too much.

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,990
Who's there!

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,650
Where is he?

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Is that a human or a ghost?

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,970
Catch him!

48
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,740
This spice smells unique.

49
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,940
It should be homemade spice.

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,650
Jianchuan, track the trace of this spice.

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:37,980
Yes.

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,290
The female thief is so skilled at flying.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,110
What's the smell?

54
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,140
Is it poisonous?

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,530
My lord.

56
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,950
Isn't this Mei Shiqi's home?

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,860
You wait here.

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,590
What are you doing?

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,329
Put on your clothes first.

60
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,140
Get out.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
I can't leave.

62
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,300
What if you destroy the evidence after I leave?

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,490
Evidence? What evidence?

64
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,290
Can I turn around and talk?

65
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,260
Go ahead.

66
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,630
Why are you sniffing my clothes, you pervert?

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,360
His Majesty was attacked.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,850
Your clothing is the evidence.

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,930
I followed the female ghost's scent here.

70
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,050
You tell me if this is my business.

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm warning you one last time.

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,820
Get out right now.

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,250
People are more likely to tell the truth when they're embarrassed.

74
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,010
This is the basic interrogation technique in the Investigation Bureau.

75
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,290
Explain to me now.

76
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,020
What's your relationship with that female ghost?

77
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,279
I'll talk to you

78
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,839
when I'm dressed properly.

79
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,820
Leng Moyan!

80
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,810
Oh no. The lord is in danger.

81
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,400
Yes.

82
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,830
He will send us signals when he is in danger.

83
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,950
You...

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,820
Wait and see.

85
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,390
Don't run away, if you dare.

86
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,240
My lord,

87
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,350
why didn't we arrest Mei Shiqi?

88
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,700
When she returned to the banquet hall from the backyard,

89
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,140
the female ghost in white was already committing the crime.

90
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,850
Mei Shiqi had no time to commit the crime.

91
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,050
So the smell should have been left on her

92
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,240
accidentally

93
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,300
when she was in contact with the female ghost.

94
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,230
All the more reason to arrest her and ask her about it.

95
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,010
His Majesty asked us to investigate the case

96
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,460
to counterbalance the factions of power.

97
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,620
What can we do if she refuses to tell us?

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,820
Even so,

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,780
we don't have to hide.

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,020
My lord, what happened when you were in her house?

101
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,710
Just a little...

102
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,860
Are you bored?

103
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,560
Go out and check.

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,260
Yes.

105
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,990
Tighten the defense within the residence.

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,520
When that woman goes crazy,

107
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,120
it's really scary.

108
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,870
She's rude, tough, and fierce.

109
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,220
She doesn't look like a woman at all.

110
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,500
This is new.

111
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,650
There is someone of whom Mr. Leng is afraid...

112
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,980
What are you murmuring about?

113
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,020
Nothing. I'll strengthen the defense.

114
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,150
and won't let her in.

115
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,740
You two

116
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,340
didn't even hide.

117
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,420
How dare you disrespect me?

118
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,940
Mei Shiqi. This is the Investigation Bureau.

119
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,050
Show your respect.

120
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,770
I like to do whatever I want.

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,620
Tie me up if you dare.

122
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,820
Come on.

123
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,780
Tie me up!

124
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,180
Untie me!

125
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,380
No.

126
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,220
Leng Moyan.

127
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,170
Come here and untie me.

128
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,100
Promise you won't cause any trouble,

129
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
and I'll untie you right away.

130
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,260
No way.

131
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,890
I want the entire capital

132
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,330
to see your true face.

133
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,980
My true face?

134
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,180
Do I look good?

135
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,730
How about getting flogged 30 times?

136
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,420
Out.

137
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,560
Still looking?

138
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,490
What true face?

139
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,300
You are a shameless and lewd pervert.

140
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,110
You peeped at me in the name of investigation...

141
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,270
Enough.

142
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,290
About what happened today,

143
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,820
I was being rude.

144
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,230
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,690
If you want to tell anyone,

146
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,510
I'm willing to take the heat.

147
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,690
My lord, the Secret Guards Department is here for her.

148
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,530
That soon?

149
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,060
The Secret Guards Department is so imposing!

150
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,810
You're barging in armed like that.

151
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,690
You don't respect our bureau at all.

152
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,100
Cut the crap. Why was Shiqi arrested?

153
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
It's a life at stake.

154
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,060
Let her go now.

155
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,880
It was Mei Shiqi who barged into the Bureau

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,890
and caused us trouble.

157
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,460
How dare you come here and ask us to release her?

158
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,720
If you keep doing this,

159
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,210
I'll arrest all of you!

160
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,030
Shisan!

161
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,890
Put it down.

162
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,620
Put it down.

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,820
Put it down.

164
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,050
I just had a little misunderstanding with Miss Mei Shiqi.

165
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,340
It's fine now since we can talk it out.

166
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,890
OK.

167
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,830
Let's clarify this right now.

168
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,210
Shiqi, just tell us the whole story.

169
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,870
No matter how arrogant and overbearing

170
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,050
the Investigation Bureau is,

171
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,050
we're not pushovers.

172
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,660
I'll back you, no matter what.

173
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,720
Thank you, Shisan.

174
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,680
Here's the thing.

175
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,070
I was on duty at Prince Jing's Mansion

176
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,490
and fought with the female thief who ambushed His Majesty.

177
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,850
Mr. Leng came to me

178
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,430
because he wanted us to work together.

179
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,570
Then why did you fight him with your life

180
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,220
and almost destroy your house?

181
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,140
That's...

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,140
That's because...

183
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,460
Because...

184
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,390
-Because...
-Because...

185
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,850
Because...

186
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,210
Because we were recreating the scene

187
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,460
of what happened between her and the female thief.

188
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,460
So we can know from whom she learned.

189
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,860
Ah, right.

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,660
That female thief is cunning.

191
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,190
We need more time

192
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,300
to find the source.

193
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,740
Since it's a misunderstanding,

194
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,670
we apologize for the disturbance.

195
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,660
Goodbye.

196
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,510
Wait.

197
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,720
Is there anything else, Mr. Leng?

198
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,530
I can let bygones be bygones.

199
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,870
You can leave.

200
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
But she must stay.

201
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,310
Why?

202
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,900
Because we have something important to discuss.

203
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
You interrupted us just now, right?

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,020
I remember now.

205
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,930
Shisan, you can go back first.

206
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,840
When I'm done with Mr. Leng,

207
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,640
I'll meet you at the department.

208
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,790
Are your eyes cramping?

209
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,330
I've been busy lately.

210
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,050
I'm having an intermittent stroke

211
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,940
in my eyes.

212
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,210
Goodbye.

213
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,020
Go back.

214
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,410
Go back first.

215
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,740
I won't work with someone like you.

216
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,140
Don't even think about it.

217
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,650
Are you sure you won't tell us anything?

218
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,820
Very sure.

219
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,260
His Majesty has ordered

220
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,190
whoever catches the female thief first

221
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,420
will be rewarded.

222
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
So what?

223
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,950
Not only can he get a promotion and a salary raise,

224
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,690
but he can also ask His Majesty for a good marriage.

225
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,220
If you're not interested,

226
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,500
I'll ask Shisan.

227
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,690
But let's make a deal first.

228
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,260
If we catch the thief, we'll be able to catch the thief. We'll be able to catch the thief. We'll be able to catch the thief. We'll be able to catch the thief. Okay.

229
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,220
I'll take the first credit.

230
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,260
Your bureau has to take the second.

231
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,230
Fine, you can take the credit.

232
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
But I saw the compensation.

233
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,630
What did you see?

234
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,670
-I saw…
-You didn’t see anything!

235
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,500
It's a deal.

236
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,620
At that time...

237
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,770
This is what happened.

238
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,450
This girl must be something

239
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,490
since she could get away with the Imperial Guards,

240
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,820
the Investigation Bureau,

241
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,300
and the guards of Princess Jing's Mansion.

242
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,900
The boss that Chen Bao mentioned didn't show up.

243
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,420
If he wants to disturb the court,

244
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,020
he won't let it go easily.

245
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Our top priority is to find the mastermind.

246
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,700
So, you mean she's in cahoots with Chen Bao?

247
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,140
I'm not sure.

248
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Since the female ghost has escaped,

249
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,260
she won't appear for a while.

250
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,540
What should we do?

251
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,230
The scent of the sachet on the female ghost

252
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,870
is quite distinct from regular spices.

253
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,180
If we can find the rogue shop that makes the sachet,

254
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,110
we can definitely find clues.

255
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,240
You seemed very skilled

256
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,050
when you sniffed my clothes.

257
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,540
Looks like you've been in contact with a lot of girls.

258
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,260
That's right. There are girls I know well

259
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,390
in the top four imperial music offices

260
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,120
and 58 brothels in the capital.

261
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,300
What? Are you jealous?

262
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,650
In your dream.

263
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll send someone to investigate the source of the spices.

264
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,240
But there's only one piece of clothing.

265
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,620
Rude.

266
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,350
Barbarian.

267
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,410
This clothing has been touched

268
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,020
by some despicable man anyway.

269
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,540
I can't wear it anymore.

270
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,280
Gosh.

271
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,060
Seems like you can't wear this one either.

272
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,940
Leng Moyan, you...
