Yes.

Don't you think we're a good match?

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
From his eyes and temperament,

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
I don't think he is a eunuch.

to take you to see Luo Qingchen.

84

Our master ordered Luo Qingchen to ambush His Majesty.

91
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,010
This matter was divulged.

94

If Miss Luo, no,

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,310
Luo Qingchen really assassinated His Majesty,

97
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,270
Prince Jing will be implicated.

98

100
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,790
Then tell me everything you know.

101
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,240
Miss Luo is known as

102
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,110
the most popular courtesan,

103
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,260
but actually, she is a spy sent here by Prince Jing.

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,960
But Prince Jing never ordered her to assassinate His Majesty.

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,210
I don't even know who your master is.

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,600

107
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,560
Please spare my life.

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,730
Bharat Yagha does look pretty.

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,780
When she took off her clothes,

110
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,159
I was tempted.

111
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,530
You couldn't look away from her.

112
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,390
Was you, a eunuch, seduced by her?

113
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,540
Who saw it?

114
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
I saw it myself.

115
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,720
Fine.

116
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,380
I didn't bring you here to enjoy her beauty.

117
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,050
Wait.

118
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,060
What?

119
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,220
Did you see that?

120
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,210
Luo Qingchen is a spy sent by Prince Jing.

121
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,090
So what?

122
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,870
So I had no reason to kill her.

123
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,070
I would keep her alive

124
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,570
to testify against Prince Jing.

125
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,230
You mean she was a double spy?

126
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,050
On the one hand, she lurked in Lotus Wonderland to help Prince Jing inquire about the news.

127
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,890
On the other hand, she was ordered by her master to ambush His Majesty

128
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,170
and framed Prince Jing.

129
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,810
So there are only two possible reasons to kill her.

130
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,280
First, Prince Jing killed her in case of being framed.

131
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Second,

132
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,830
the master killed her to spare all later trouble.

133
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,100
Why do you trust me so much?

134
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,880
Don't you think

135
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,880
I work for Prince Jing or the master?

136
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,290
I believe you

137
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,110
want to find out the murderer, like me.

138
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,770
Don't try to get close to me. I don't believe you.

139
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,820
Maybe you are the master.

140
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,600
If I were,

141
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,400
I would have given up the plan because of you.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,780
Why?

143
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,270
Because

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I don't want you to get promoted and a raise, marry a matrilocal husband,

145
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,450
and bring disaster to the world.

146
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,700

147
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,530

how dare you!

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,450
How dare you release the criminal of the ambush case?

151
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,799
Master, there is something wrong.

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,840
The procuress of the Lotus Wonderland admitted

153
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Luo Qingchen is the spy of Prince Jing.

154
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,559

155
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,520
Shut up!

157
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,880
if word gets out,

158
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,960
Prince Jing will be taken as the murderer.

159
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,900
Do you know

160
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,970
Prince Jing is the one who founded the Secret Guards Department?

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,920
Master,

162
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,470
all persons are equal in the eyes of the law.

163
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,640
The Secret Guards Department

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,380
works for the people.

165
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,960
What if

166
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,880
he's trying to lure you into the trap?

167

He...

168
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,940
He is indeed cunning.

169
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,420
That's right.

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Shiqi, take me to arrest him now

171
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
to make amends.

172
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,510

174

You let me down.

175
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,440
Has he bewitched you?

176
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,080
From now on,

177
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,800

No! Master!

181
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,810
Get out.

182
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,530
No.

183
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,140

186
