00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,950
Don't slack off.

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,810
My lord, I did what you ordered.

6
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,729
This is Blooming Flowers and Full Moon specially made by Taibai House.

7
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,460
It's lunch for family reunion.

8
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,479
Leng Moyan, you are so annoying.

9
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,440
You assigned me numerous cases

10
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,930
and asked me to run errands for you.

11
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,990
I went all the way to buy lunch for you.

12
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,789
Thank you.

13
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,300
Do you want to have a rest and eat with me?

14
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,560
Why do you have so much delicious food?

15
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,820
The workload in the Investigation Bureau is too heavy.

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,620
I don't want to suffer from malnutrition.

17
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,620
So I brought these from home.

18
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
They are nutritious.

19
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,530
Did you

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
made these yourself?

21
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,790
Of course, I made them myself.

22
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,329
I'm known as a good cook in my hometown.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
How is it? Smells good, right?

Let's eat together.

25
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,810
Taibai House has a new chef.

26
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,610
The taste is better than before.

27
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,340
No.

28
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,670
My lord, I look ugly and rude when eating.

29
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,720
I don't want to affect your appetite.

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,400
It's fine. I don't mind.

31
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,540
Fine.

32
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,540
Why don't you eat, my lord?

33
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,240
Do you have no appetite?

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,579
I want to eat too.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,230
But you have to give me a chance.

36
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm sorry, my lord.

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,710
This is my ancestral skill.

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,780
It's okay, my lord. You may have your lunch break.

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,750
Leave these things to me.

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,090
My lord, where are we going?

41
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,260
To eat.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,030
Didn't we have lunch?

43
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,500
You did, but I didn't.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,350
Moyan.

45
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Your Highness, why are you here?

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,110
Let's go eat.

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,300
I have a lot to tell you.

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,790
Your Highness, we had lunch.

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,620
So sad to hear that.

50
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,360
It's our privilege to be invited by Your Highness.

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,190
We may have some.

52
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,270
That's right.

53
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,310
But my lord,

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,910
we have to investigate the clues

55
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,160
of Luo Qingchen's poisoning case this afternoon.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
You would get sleepy if you ate too much.

57
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,570
It wouldn't be a big deal if you delayed that for one or two hours.

58
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,510
Let's go.

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,670
Let's go.

60
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,530
Try this.

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,480
Thank you. I will do it myself.

62
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,760
Your Highness, you are noble.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
It's inappropriate.

64
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,040
How come?

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,510
There are no outsiders.

66
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,909
You may continue as if I weren't here.

67
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,840
Can't you see I'm having dinner with Moyan

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,340
and we are having a private conversation?

69
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,940
Why don't you leave us alone?

70
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,960
Your Highness.

71
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
My mission

72
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,520
is to follow my lord closely and keep him safe.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,580
Why don't you have some too?

74
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,070
No.

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,930
This is a set meal for a couple.

76
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,400
It's inauspicious if she is involved.

77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,450
I have no appetite.

78
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,900
What do you think of the food?

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,550
Isn't it better

80
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,720
than Blooming Flowers and Full Moon?

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,150
I've never had it, so...

82
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,430
The ingredients of Blooming Flowers and Full Moon are good,

83
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,920
but its hot dishes are too greasy

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,410
while cold dishes are too bland.

85
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,410
You might hiccup if you eat too much.

86
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,510
Who are you to answer?

87
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,390
Moyan, look at her.

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,280
Your Highness.

89
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,300
As the Deputy of the Investigation Bureau

90
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,590
and personal guard of Mr. Leng,

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,530
I am not at your command.

92
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,760
It's her duty.

93
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,260
Please don't mind it, Your Highness.

94
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,650
I'm not in the mood to eat

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,260
when she stands here.

96
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,390
Why don't you hang out for a while?

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,850
I'll go back myself later.

98
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,830
Roger that.

99
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,640
Your Highness, I have a lot of things to deal with.

100
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,420
Let's call it a day.

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,600
Moyan, don't go.

102
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,810
I invited you here today

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,400
to tell you something.

104
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,010
Before I met you,

105
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,950
I heard that you were a great talent in the capital.

106
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,670
After I saw you in person,

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,800
I thought you were 100 times better than what they said.

108
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,670
I'm of an age to marry.

109
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,380
In my heart...

110
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,400
Your Highness.

111
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,270
Have you heard

112
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,210
some rumors about me?

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
What rumors?

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,980
It seems that you still don't know me well.

115
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,450
It's okay, Moyan.

116
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,659
I think if you know my feelings,

117
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,500
we will have enough time to understand each other.

118
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,860
I wonder if you have the same feelings

119
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,130
as I do?

120
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,350
Really?

122
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,240
Goodbye.

123
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,460
Excuse me, another pot.

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,460
Your Highness?

125
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,340
I thought he was talking about me.

126
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,070
But as I listened carefully,

127
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,670
I found that he was talking about another lady.

128
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,300
He said

129
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,670
she was arrogant,

130
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,570
domineering,

131
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,730
overly ambitious,

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,330
and violent.

133
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,170
She thought herself clever.

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,310
But whenever I see her,

135
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,810
I blush and my heart races.

136
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,630
That Fox has a bad taste.

137
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,610
No one would like to

138
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,000
get close to the lady he described.

139
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,000
But he turns a blind eye

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,090
to Your Highness who is as beautiful as a fairy.

141
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,050
As a fairy?

142
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,460
I didn't expect I was beautiful like this in your eyes.

143
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,580
You have a good taste.

144
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,870
To be honest,

145
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,570
even you are

146
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,659
hundreds of times better

147
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,299
than that uneducated lady,

148
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,070
not to mention someone as beautiful as me.

149
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,540
Of course.

150
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,330
This is true.

151
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,830
Leng Moyan has no merits.

152
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,080
He's stupid and ignorant.

153
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,700
He only knows some tricks.

154
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,160
His character

155
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,990
is extremely bad.

156
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,420
Besides,

157
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,430
he's very scheming.

158
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,050
But Moyan is quite handsome.

159
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,500
Is he handsome?

160
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,480
Just an ordinary man.

161
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,640
But he has a good figure.

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,580
How do you know?

163
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,400
I saw it.

164
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,390
I'll take you there to have a look next time.

165
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,840
Deal.

166
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,570
Deal.

167
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,510
Cheers.

168
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,350
Your Highness, let me refill your cup.

169
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,320
Your Highness, let's drink more.

170
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,350
Let's have more.

171
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,290
Your Highness, let's drink more.

172
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,060
Your Highness.

173
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,340
Let's have more.

174
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,660
Actually, I really hate him sometimes,

175
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,350
especially when he lies to me.

176
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,860
I wanted to bite him,

177
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,470
but I couldn't.

178
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,630
I was afraid that he would be hurt.

179
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,980
Don't laugh at me.

180
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,060
This is only between us.

181
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm too kind.

182
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,950
Time to go back.

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,790
my heart

190
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,260
raced.

191
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,400
♫My love for you is beyond the words in the letter♫

192
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,460
It thumped

193
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,790
strongly.

194
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,030
I...

195
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:12,170
♫The blue sea and sky are rare beauties in the world♫

196
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,250
I wanted to

197
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
kiss him

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,290
like this.

199
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,360
♫It is the Eden♫

200
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,550
♫This feeling will become a memory to be cherished♫

201
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,730
♫Each string, each stop, bears thought of vanished things♫

202
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,930
♫The love letter on the peach petal I gave you♫
