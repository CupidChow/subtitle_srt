4
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,030
I want to treat you to a meal as an apology.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
Are you available?

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,860
No, I'm not.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,920
Watch out!

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,400
Who is it?

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,850
I told you I have something else to do.

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,290
Don't move.

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,500
Run! Hurry!

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,410
Protect the lord.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,940
You're so calm.

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,510
You must have been assassinated often.

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,110
Not really.

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,170
Just seven or eight times a month.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,350
You deserve it.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,110
What did you say?

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,970
These people are despicable.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,940
They can't even tolerate a loyal and patriotic

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,000
official like you.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,510
Do you get hurt often?

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,110
Seven or eight times a month.

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,830
You deserve it.

What?

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,160
Didn't you say you'd treat me to a meal?

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,390
Mr. Leng,

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,470
you're such a generous person.

31
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,390
Donâ€™t take my words seriously.

32
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,570
You didn't just invite me

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,910
here to drink today, right?

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,949
For Consort Chen's case,

35
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,710
it's my first time solving a case independently.

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,870
It concerns my reputation and position in the department.

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,270
I can't mess it up.

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,510
So I want to

39
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,630
know about the progress of the case.

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,910
No comment.

41
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,910
Fine.

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,000
Can you remove all the traps around

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,920
Consort Chen's chamber?

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,680
Impossible.

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,130
You...

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,900
Haven't you already found

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,760
substantial evidence implicating Shi Jianchuan?

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,600
How could the Chief Deputy of the Investigation Bureau

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,940
leave such a poor evidence if he committed murder?

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,820
Someone must have framed him.

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,670
What if

52
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
we just wanted you to think that way?

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,300
He is really the murderer?

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,980
If he is,

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,530
how could I tell you so easily?

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,960
You...

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,330
What's wrong?

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,840
Feeling itchy?

59
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Are you poisoned with our special-made itching drug?

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,190
Oh no!

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,340
I heard that once poisoned with this drug, the whole body will become unbearably itchy,

62
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,600
and it will fester and lead to death

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,840
within seven days.

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,920
This is too miserable.

65
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,350
You...

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,650
If you want the antidote, it's simple.

67
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,250
Tell me how to pass the trap around Consort Chen's chamber.

68
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,450
Stop scratching. The more you scratch, the itchier it gets.

69
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,790
Here.

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,740
Give me the antidote.

71
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,060
What did you do to me?

72
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,110
You must have been poisoned with the Investigation Bureau's secret drug,

73
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,990
Laughing Powder.

74
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,130
If you don't take the antidote within half an hour,

75
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,510
you will die laughing hysterically.

76
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,950
You...

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,150
Want the antidote?

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,740
Sure.

79
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,710
But you have to exchange something with me.

80
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,510
What is it?

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,510
I want you.

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,710
No, no way!

83
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,480
You misunderstood.

84
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,070
Just promise me one thing.

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,470
Praise me out loud.

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,690
But there's

87
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,350
nothing worth praising about you.

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,909
Leng Moyan,

89
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,390
you are the most handsome guy in the capital.

90
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,050
You are elegant and charming,

91
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,480
handsome and dashing.

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,140

Oh no.

96

Leng Moyan, I swear I won't marry until I avenge this grudge.

97
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,780
Oh no.

98
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,030

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,250
Shiqi, I thought there was a thief in the house.

100
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,780
Shisan, do you have any antidote for itching?

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,950
It's not easy to make the itching antidote.

102
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,710
We've been out of stock for a long time.

103
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,640
What should I do?

104
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,990
I still have a little bit left,

105
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,870
but I can't give it to you.

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,510
I need to save it for emergency. Bye.

107
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,710
Shisan, you can't just watch me suffer.

108
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,150
It will be gone in four hours.

109
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,310
It's not poison. What are you afraid of?

110
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,270
I mean you.

111
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,590

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,230

191
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,790
I'm fine.

192
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,380
The assassin hasn't escaped yet.

193
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,250
He should be hiding somewhere in the department.

194
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,380
I will find the thief

195
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,590
no matter what.

196
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,850
Nothing here.

197
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,670
Go search elsewhere.

198
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,490
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,430
My lord,

200
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,040
I saw signs of the window being pried open.

201
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,770
I thought you were threatened.

202
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,990
I'm fine here.

203
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,520
Go check somewhere else.

204
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,540
You may leave.

205
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,010
Yes, sir.
