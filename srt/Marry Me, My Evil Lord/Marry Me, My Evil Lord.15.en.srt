Your interest in that girl

Your Highness, would you consider Shi Jianchuan?

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,950
He's...

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
quite nice.

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,220
Skilled in martial arts

76
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,330
and treats me well.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,950
He has saved me many times.

78
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,490
It's just that...

79
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,870
What?

80
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,000
He looks a bit tacky,

81
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,840
not as elegant

82
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,190
and poised as you.

83
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,060
However, with a little grooming,

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,940
I think he could be quite handsome.

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,870
But still,

86
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,560
he would be a little behind you.

87
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,460
Well,

88
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,080
would you consider him?

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,790
How is that possible?

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,170
Without you,

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,740
I might consider him.

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,670
Otherwise, absolutely not.

93
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,750

94
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,320

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,480
Impossible.

99
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,150
It was impossible that I kissed him.

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,030
Wait.

101
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,030
Even if I kissed him,

102
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,530
he's not made of wood;

103
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,340
he couldn't possibly stay still and not dodge.

104
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,430
That was a dream. Yes.

105
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,140
It must be a dream.

106
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,730
I was so shocked.

107
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,390
But this dream

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,390
felt a bit too real.

109
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,640
Forget it. I'll leave now.

110
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,020

Are you okay?

113
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,640
You didn't sleep well last night?

What did I lie to you?

127
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,190
I just asked the servants.

128
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,590
They said I got drunk last night,

129
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,300

130
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,350

182
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,110
However, your behavior yesterday made me think

183
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,740
that this dream must not be real.

184
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,700
What did I do?

185
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,710

186
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,390
♫The maple trees and the fishermen's bonfires by the riverside♫

187
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,640
♫Can't hear my yearning♫

188
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,390
and you even seemed to enjoy it a bit.

189
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,370
♫A passenger ship is moored♫

190
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,940
♫On the shore, who is lingering?♫

191
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,690
That feels so unreal.

192
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,220
♫Last year's letters, I've read them countless times♫

193
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,760
What's unreal about it?

194
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,260
♫Only to fulfill our appointment♫

195
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,050
Because you clearly have someone else in your heart.

196
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,510
♫To see you♫

197
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,830
If I kissed you,

198
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,480
and you didn't avoid it,

199
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,100
it means you like me.

200
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,360
♫On the three-life stone, our fate is engraved♫

201
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,450
But that's impossible.

202
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,670
♫Circle around it♫

203
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,030
So, it feels so unreal.

204
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,030
♫Love from the past life♫

205
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,080
♫Will my wish come true?♫

206
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,260
That makes sense.

207
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,710
So, I want to ask you,

208
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,900
♫A glance from you♫

209
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,160
♫Brought back all my memories of you♫

210
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,110
did I

211
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,000
really kiss you last night?

212
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,659
I don't remember.

213
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
♫Today, I got drunk♫

214
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,299
How could you possibly not remember?

215
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,610
♫Ignoring the world's troubles♫

216
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,070
It wasn't you who drank last night.

217
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,460
♫My hair turned white♫

218
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,750
I have hundreds of cases to investigate

219
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,780
♫Lovesickness turned into an illness like a knife♫

220
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,730
every day.

221
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,260
♫The cool wind and bright moon invite me♫

222
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,260
What's wrong with forgetting a trivial matter?

223
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
A trivial matter?

224
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,670
How is this a trivial matter? It's very important, okay?

225
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,980
♫Just like seeing Zhou Yu and Qiao together♫

226
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,250
How could you possibly not remember?

227
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
♫In this beautiful land♫

228
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,240
Fine, then it was a dream.

229
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,400
♫I only have affection for you♫

230
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
♫I don't care about the world's troubles♫

231
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,020
A dream?

232
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,680
♫With you, I'm satisfied♫

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,210
Well, this dream felt a bit too real.

234
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,950
♫With the one I love by my side, I'm very happy♫

235
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,000
♫Let's enjoy this beautiful night together♫

236
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,020
I have an idea.

237
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,610
What is it?

238
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,290
Let's recreate the scene from the dream you had yesterday

239
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,020
and see if it matches the dream.

240
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,170
If it does, then that dream was real.

241
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,220
If not,

242
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,570
then it was just a dream.

243
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,690
That makes sense.

244
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,400
Come on.

245
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
Stand up.

246
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
You were standing like this.

247
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,150
Your hands were in this position. I was sitting,

248
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,850
and drunk.

249
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,680
You lifted me up from the chair.

250
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,650
Then I...

251
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,320
Forget it.

252
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,380
It was indeed a trivial matter.

253
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,590
I remember it now. It was real.

254
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,090
You fox!

255
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:58,930
Liar!

256
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,830
You knew it was true from the beginning.

257
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,860
I never said it was not real. Besides,

258
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,260
why did you dream that I kissed you?

259
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,320
I...

260
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,780
I...

261
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,410
I was drunk,

262
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,380
and mistook you for someone else. Okay?

263
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,290
Then you must have mixed feelings

264
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,430
about that person.

265
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,030
Otherwise,

266
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
why would you bite me?

267
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,550
Is this...

268
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,190
my bite?

269
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,040
So embarrassing!
