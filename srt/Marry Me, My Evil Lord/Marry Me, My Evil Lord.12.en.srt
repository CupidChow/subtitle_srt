[Episode 12 Fake Eunuch’s Cave Love]

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,310
So,

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,680
Mr. Leng was deceived by Mei Shiqi.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,270
That's why he was poisoned by the Secret Guards Department

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,040
and became wanted?

8
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,920
Judging from the situation we met,

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,920
he didn't seem to notice

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,320
Mei Shiqi had been deceiving and using him.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,870
Darn it. We must catch them soon.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,980
She must be hiding with Lord Leng.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,780
How should we lure her out?

14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,910
Since she's from the Secret Guards Department,

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,910
people there will find a way to lure her out.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,030
But why would they help us?

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,129
I have my own way.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,000
Hey!

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,410
-What are you doing?
-What?

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,780
That's what I was about to ask.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why did you lie to me?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,470
When did I lie to you?

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,240
You...

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,440
You are not a eunuch!

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,350
I have my reasons.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Reasons?

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
If you don't tell me, I will kill you.

28
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,650
Leng Moyan

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,450
was indeed a eunuch.

30
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,650
But I'm not Leng Moyan.

31
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,539
What do you mean?

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,430
I'm Leng Moyan's twin brother, Leng Yanxing.

33
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,770
He had been investigating

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,480
the rebels for a long time.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
Due to his vicious tactics,

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
he was assassinated.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,080
In order to protect Family Leng's power in the court,

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,000
they asked me to continue

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,810
his work in the Investigation Bureau.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,230
You're lying!

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,720
I've checked.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,710
Leng Moyan didn't have siblings.

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,860
That's because his file had been revised by His Majesty.

44
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,190
What you saw is all fake.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,630
You did all this

46
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,360
just to keep your position?

47
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,890
I don't believe it.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
You are the mastermind of a series of cases

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,990
since Consort Chen's suicide.

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,400
You forged Consort Chen's suicide scene

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,320
and tried to assassinate His Majesty to frame Prince Jing.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,780
You also killed Luo Qingchen to silence her.

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,190
In order to cover up these crimes,

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,120
you made up a fake “master”

55
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,310
to confuse us.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,190
In fact, you are the master you mentioned.

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
We've been through so many things.

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,190
I thought you knew me well.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,090
It was my wishful thinking.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,720
Most importantly, your roles

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,840
in these cases are suspicious.

62
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,920
I have to suspect you.

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,470
But if you hand me over,

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,200
I will be killed.

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,510
Only by finding the murderer and finding out the truth,

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,000
can I ensure the peace of the country

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,590
and prove our affection.

68
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,470
There's nothing special between us.

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,200
I'll keep you here

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
until I find the real master.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,870
If you can't find him forever,

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,760
will I be locked up here forever?

73
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,030
Are you questioning my ability to investigate?

74
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,720
No.

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
I just think if you keep tying me up,

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,200
you'll be in trouble.

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,280

78
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,850
I want to go to the toilet.

79

Go ahead.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,040
It's just a little torment and you got so sick.

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,720
Poor health.

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,880
What?

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,960
I'll take good care of myself for you.

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,550
Your health condition is none of my business.

We meet again.

94
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,090
Mr. Shengu,

95
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,900
why did you trick me here?

96
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,550
How did you know the code of the Secret Guards Department?

97
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,400
My master is proficient in Purple Star Astrology and codes.

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,200
The code of the Secret Guards Department

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,470
was designed by my master.

100
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,930
Tell me.

101
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,810
Where did you hide Moyan?

102
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,400
Your Highness, you may misunderstand me.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Why would I lie to him?

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,950
Then why did the Secret Guards Department

105
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,790
deliberately frame Mr. Leng?

106
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,560
Your date at Qixi Festival

107
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,760
was a trap to lure Mr. Leng, wasn't it?

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,220
Well...

109
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,950
Didn't I make it clear to Leng Moyan?

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,870
It's not clear to me.

111
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,700
Miss Shiqi.

112
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,560
You'd better explain it now.

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,890
I don't need to tell you.

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,730
Return Moyan back to me!

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
Mr. Shi.

116
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,400
It's my master's Fanyin Soul Depriving Formation.

117
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,350
Miss Shiqi, I don't want to hurt you.

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,450
Please put down your blade

119
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,120
and take us to Mr. Leng.

120
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,310
Why can she manage to escape from the Soul Depriving Fanyin?

121
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,160
Miss Shiqi is getting

124
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,190
I have my own way.

125
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,650
Take care of Mr. Shi.

126
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,300
Mr. Shi, are you alright?

127

I'm fine.

Your Highness,

129
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,970
sorry for making you worried.

130
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,950
How could you be fine?

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,370
Your wound is bleeding.

132
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,740
Are you feeling better?

I'll make the medicine for you.

Lord Shengu Feng?

137
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,030
What made you here?

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,110
Don't be nervous.

139
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,290
I mean no harm.

140
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm here to propose a marriage.

141
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,630
Propose? Who are you proposing to?

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Of course, I'm going to propose to Miss Shiqi.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,440
I can't propose to you.

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Mr. Shengu,

145
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,060
if I remember correctly,

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,110
we've only met twice.

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,640
Your beauty

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,340
is like a cloud hiding from the moon,

149
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,070
and the wind escaping from the snow.

150
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,180
Your beauty

151
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,430
made me

152
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,510
have a crush on you

153
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,680
at first sight,

154
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,380
and fall in love with you at the second sight.

155
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,080
This time,

156
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,930
I've been deeply in love with you.

157
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,460
So I came to propose to you to relieve the pain of missing you.

158
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,230
Mr. Shengu,

159
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,680
thank you for your affection.

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,840
But everyone knows

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,230
I'm going to find a matrilocal husband.

162
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,150
I see.

163
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,970
I perfectly match

164
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,730
your requirements.

165
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,820
Most importantly, I am living out of my hometown,

166
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
and my parents died.

167
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,720
I can be your

168
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,120
matrilocal husband.

169
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,810
This is indeed...

170
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Are you okay?

171
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,159
You're over the moon

172
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,780
with a few flattering words?

173
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,549
I was happy because of his flattering words?

174
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,070
He was trying to trap me with Shi Jianchuan

175
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,600
and Her Highness.

176
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,190
They are up to no good.

177
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:43,799
I see.

178
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,090
Miss Shiqi,

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,760
no matter what choice you make,

180
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,350
I will always support you.

181
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,380
People will know

182
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,990
I am your best matrilocal husband.

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
You've been causing trouble

184
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
and hurting girls, have you?

185
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,760
Mr. Leng, are you jealous?

186
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,430
No way.

187
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:05,930
That's good.

188
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,200
I was worried that

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,750
you would be my strong rival.

190
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,680
You're mawkish.

191
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,090
What if Miss Shiqi has already had a crush on someone?

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,220
Miss Shiqi.

193
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,450
Do you have a crush on someone?

194
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,200
I...

195
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,190
I only want to focus on my career

196
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
and get promoted.

197
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,830
I want to become a commander soon

198
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,430
so that I can have a lot of matrilocal husbands.

199
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,220
That's right.

200
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,880
Love is not as important as investigation.

201
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,020
Leng Moyan, you lied to me again!

202
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,330
You care so much about him.

203
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,870
He must be the one you like.

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,520
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,520
He's a treacherous liar.

206
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,130
What do I like about him?

207
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,750
As the saying goes,

208
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,750
it's hard to notice when the love starts and how deep your love is.

209
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,870
No way.

210
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
Are you here

211
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,970
to propose or make trouble?

212
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
If you are here to propose,

213
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,030
I'm not in the mood today.

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,950
If you come to make trouble...

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,870
Your temperament changes so quickly.

216
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,070
It shows that

217
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,860
Mr. Leng is very important

218
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,230
to you.

219
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,410
But it doesn't matter.

220
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,350
You just fell in love with him

221
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,960
and went astray.

222
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,790
I won't mind.

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,430
You don't mind?

224
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,260
What do you mean?

225
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm willing to compete with Mr. Leng fairly.

226
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
From today onwards, I'll pursue you.

227
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,270
I will win your heart

228
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,250
with my wisdom and perseverance.

229
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,460
Are all the Taoist priests nowadays

230
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,940
so confident and proactive?

231
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,630
Leng Moyan.

232
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,540
Learn from him.

233
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,450
Look at you!

234
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,690
You're always lying to me!
