[Episode 4 Playing a trick to catch the real murderer together]

4
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,900
I'll prove it to you.

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,780
Whose coat is this?

6
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,550
Leng Moyan.

7
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,920
Shiqi, I was going to see you.

8
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,700
There's news from Consort Chen's family?

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,960
Of course, I am

10
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:04,959
the best.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,840
I hid in her mourning hall

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,300
for three days and nights.

13
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,000
There's a big secret.

14
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,100
Tell me.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,730
On the day Consort Chen died,

16
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:17,200
she secretly had a maid give a letter to her parents.

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,430
Then this maid, Cui,

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,580
went to the palace to get a very important letter.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,610
Do you have the letter?

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,270
Where is it?

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,690
I don't have it.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,650
Consort Chen was dead when the maid got there.

23
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,730
What's your point?

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,440
Silly.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,170
Think about it, why did Consort Chen

26
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,090
have someone deliver a letter?

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,220
Obviously, she had sensed the danger.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,270
You mean

29
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,430
the murderer didn't know about

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,210
the undelivered letter.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,450
It's still in Consort Chen's chamber.

32
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,500
Shisan, you're so smart.

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,130
Thank you.

34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,120
Shiqi?

35
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,200
A letter.

36
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,210
Where would she hide the letter?

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,640
Mei Shiqi,

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,870
you are really a genius detective.

39
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,550
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,360
I should be asking you that.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,560
Give me the letter.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,370
It's evidence from the Investigation Bureau.

43
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,970
Anyone who takes it will be charged with obstruction of justice.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,300
You wouldn't defy the law, would you?

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,610
That's nonsense.

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm under orders to investigate the case.

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,730
You can't do anything to me.

48
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,530
You're actually strong.

49
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,680
Leng Moyan, do you think I'll give in?

50
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,630
In your dreams!

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,720
If the men in the city

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,250
knows you're fighting with a eunuch on a bed,

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,370
none of them will marry you.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,790
What do you want?

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,380
What do you want?

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,040
I'll ruin your reputation.

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,700
Leng Moyan!

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,970
-You'll never find a husband. -I'll kill you!

59
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,160
Leng Moyan.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
My lord.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,220
What happened?

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
Don't tell anyone

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,450
what you just saw.

64
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,610
If you dare,

65
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,140
I'll pull out your tongues.

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,020
Do you hear me?

67
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,650
Emm.

68
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,200
Speak.

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,890
Yes.

70
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,090
You're having a second thought?

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,010
I worked hard to find it.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,060
At least let me have a look.

73
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,540
Let's read it together.

74
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,470
You finally showed up.

75
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,890
Chen Bao.

76
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,210
Oh no.

77
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,410
The letter was burnt.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,920
We can convict him without the letter.

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,410
The Investigation Bureau is good at what we do.

80
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,650
So is the Secret Guards Department.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,740
I want to interrogate him too.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,300
[Investigation Bureau]

83
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,130
The Chief's order:

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,240
no one is allowed to go inside

85
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,000
during the interrogation of a major case.

86
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,690
I won't talk to you.

87
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,420
Tell Leng Moyan to come out.

88
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,260
Leng Moyan, you ungrateful,

89
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,690
treacherous, cheating…

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,330
If you disturb official affairs

91
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,320
and insult our Chief again,

92
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,770
you'll be killed right away.

93
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,130
Fine. I'm outnumbered.

94
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,610
I'll leave.

95
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,890
Take this...

96
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,300
Again?

97
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,409
Leng Moyan!

98
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,290
Bah!

99
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,070
I've served His Majesty for more than ten years.

100
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,760
How can you slander me?

101
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,670
I was just passing by.

102
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,070
You're framing me.

103
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,500
I have no grudge against Consort Chen.

104
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,740
Why would I kill her?

105
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,870
You didn't kill Consort Chen.

106
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,030
Don't ask. I know my kung fu.

107
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,600
This is the white ribbon that Consort Chen was strangled with.

108
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,990
The whole ribbon is clean,

109
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,810
except this spot.

110
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,160
It has a stain and dust here.

111
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,770
The stain

112
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,670
comes from the beam in Consort Chen's chamber.

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,010
So Consort Chen wasn't strangled to death in front of the bed.

114
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,360
She hanged herself from the beam.

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,170
What?

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,409
You're saying Consort Chen committed suicide?

117
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,970
Yes. After she committed suicide,

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
someone secretly set up the scene.

119
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,350
The rope on her neck

120
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,570
and the ligature marks on her wrists.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Oh, and your badge.

122
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,530
All faked afterwards.

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,450
Consort Chen committed suicide.

124
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,650
I didn't kill her. Let me go.

125
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,170
I'll going to His Majesty to sue you for framing me!

126
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,120
Let me go!

127
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,690
Although you didn't kill Consort Chen,

128
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,980
you faked the crime scene,

129
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,160
slandered good people,

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,290
obstructed justice

131
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,690
and tried to assassinate the officials of the Investigation Bureau and the Secret Guards Department.

132
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,930
It's enough to execute you.

133
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,430
Why should I plead guilty?

134
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,490
Because you know Eagle Claw Skill...

135
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,870
and Shaolin King Kong Palm.

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,170
And you have a new wound on your shoulder.

137
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,900
Ridiculous! Prince Jing also knows Eagle Claw Skill

138
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,090
and Shaolin King Kong Palm.

139
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,040
His shoulder is injured too.

140
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,650
Why don't you arrest him?

141
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,900
The assassination of Prince Jing is top secret.

142
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,860
Hardly anyone in Prince Jing's Mansion knows about it.

143
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,280
How did you know?

144
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,570
Prince Jing is injured,

145
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
but his wound is from a sword.

146
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Chen Tianbao.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
Before you started working in the palace,

148
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,900
you were a servant in the Prince Jing's Mansion.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,440
You escorted Prince Jing to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts.

150
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,600
You know his skills very well.

151
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,850
But he doesn't know

152
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,159
you secretly learned his skills.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,760
Your analysis makes sense.

154
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,260
But you're missing the point.

155
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,920
Why did I

156
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,090
do those things?

157
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,490
Although you didn't kill Consort Chen,

158
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,420
she killed herself because of you.

159
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,630
You didn't want to kill Consort Chen.

160
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,850
You wanted to kill His Majesty.

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,580
So you're not facing a charge of murder,

162
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,980
but treason.

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,580
You threatened Consort Chen's with the evidence of her father's massive embezzlement

164
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,970
and forced her to kill His Majesty while they were sleeping together.

165
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,090
But Consort Chen was deeply in love with His Majesty.

166
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,610
She couldn't bear to kill him.

167
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,210
She was afraid her father would be killed.

168
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,320
So she committed suicide to make a point.

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,240
She wrote a last letter to her family.

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,110
She wanted them to give it to His Majesty

171
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,309
and avenge her death.

172
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,970
She was afraid that you would take the letter after she died.

173
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,360
So she hid it.

174
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,460
She was right.

175
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,659
You didn't know about that letter.

176
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
You faked her suicide as a murder.

177
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,690
To hide the real cause of Consort Chen's death.

178
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,330
And to frame the Secrets Guards Department, the Investigation Bureau and Prince Jing at the same time,

179
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,240
making the officials suspect each other

180
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
and disturbing people's minds.

181
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,020
Your intentions are quite vicious.

182
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,080
You...

183
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,410
You have no evidence.

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,530
You're lying.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
You're framing me.

186
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,840
Do you think by burning Consort Chen's letter,

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,900
you can make sure nothing goes wrong?

188
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,920
You know, the Secret Guards Department

189
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
has a magic skill from the Western Regions.

190
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,020
It can make a withered tree come to life again.

191
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,740
It can also restore evidence that's more than half destroyed.

192
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,280
All the evidence of your crime is mentioned in the letter.

193
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
You can't deny it.

194
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,010
So what?

195
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,060
A single piece of evidence

196
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,010
that is proved inclusive

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,970
cannot convict me.

198
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,570
These

199
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,420
were found in your private house outside the palace.

200
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,210
Surprised?

201
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,850
One of the pigeons that carried messages to your master

202
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,650
flew back on its own.

203
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,040
As long as you tell me who your master is,

204
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
I can ask His Majesty

205
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,430
to spare your life.

206
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,530
Fine.

207
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,120
Come here. I'll only tell you.

208
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
We are...

209
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,340
Chen Bao.

210
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,760
Chen Bao.

211
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,380
Hey!

212
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,290
My lord!

213
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,090
Hey, don't die! Hey!

214
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,580
What did he tell you?

215
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,090
Who is his master? Tell me!

216
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,920
If I said he didn't tell me anything,

217
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,460
would you believe me?

218
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,920
No. What did he tell you?

219
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,900
Tell me now.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,730
I'm telling you,

221
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,370
we solved this case together.

222
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,500
If you don't tell me,

223
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,770
I won't go easy on you.

224
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,880
Every hour of every day, I'll…

225
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,950
The magic skill from the Western Reions,

226
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,860
you made it up, right?

227
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,790
Of course not.

228
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,040
You think only the Investigation Bureau

229
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,000
has weird skills? We also…

230
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,880
So?

231
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
It's an interrogation skill, okay?

232
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,710
Back on track.

233
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,290
What did he tell you?

234
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,310
I saved your life before.

235
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,010
But someone said

236
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,090
she didn't want to owe me a favor.

237
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,050
Yeah.

238
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,250
You were awake?

239
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,810
Why don't you think about

240
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,770
how to repay me?

241
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,500
How do you want me to repay you?

242
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,870
Tell me all the secrets that the Secret Guards Department has.

243
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,800
Then we're even.

244
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,000
I want to know

245
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,830
what Prince Jing is up to.

246
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,480
Who do you think I am?

247
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,410
I will never betray the Secret Guards Department.

248
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,190
Then there is only one way.

249
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,330
Say it.

250
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,610
You join the Investigation Bureau

251
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
and be my servant.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,430
You...
