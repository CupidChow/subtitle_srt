Alas.

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,660
This doesn't seem to be wearable either.

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,910
Leng Moyan, you...

7
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,530
Are you looking for sachets or rouge?

8
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,360
Sir,

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,290
do you have a sachet that smells like this?

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,090
No.

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,560
Do you know where I can buy it?

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,330
No.

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,450
Fine.

15

Few people in the capital know this fragrance.

28

This is a secret sachet made by Lotus Wonderland.

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,750
It's called Fallen Star River.

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,990
This is a luxurious meal.

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,960
It must be worth two taels of silver.

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,370

Don't tell me you added Laughing Powder to it.

Since it's compensation,

54

Oh, so you're famous investigators from the Investigation Bureau.

This is indeed made by us.

63

Only the Oirans are qualified to use it.

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,770
It is not available in the market.

65
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,890
How many Oirans do you have here?

66
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,650
Only four.

67
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,810
I wonder if you...

68
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,910

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
That's right.

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,050
How about this? I'll take them to the Bureau

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,720
after they come back.

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,500
No need. We'll come here again another day.

78
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,579

Yes.

83
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,450
The Investigation Bureau must have known something.

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,100

It's effective to alert the enemy.

There must be something behind Lotus Wonderland.

90
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,520
As long as we investigate whom these servants contact,

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,280
we'll know who's behind them.

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,010
Let's go.

Are you the owner of Lotus Wonderland?

Yes.

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,050
Lotus Wonderland is involved in the assassination of His Majesty.

97
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,510

He's our servant.

114
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,160
He seems to have something urgent.

115
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,500
You are one of the Oirans of Lotus Wonderland?

116
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,520

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,210
Nice to meet you.

118
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,130
Are you here for Grand Secretary Chen's birthday banquet?

119
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,659
Exactly.

120
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,370
Did Lotus Wonderland send ladies

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,530
to perform at the birthday banquet of Prince Jing?

122
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,250
Yes.

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,450
Someone did come to pick the performer.

124
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,090
Unfortunately, I was not chosen.

125

Do you know who selected the performer?

126
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,530
Someone from the Investigation Bureau.

127
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,120
What?

128
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,820
The Investigation Bureau?

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
Are you serious?

130
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,730
He was in the official uniform with a waist badge of the Investigation Bureau.

131
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,930
It couldn't be wrong.

132
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,490
Is there a problem?

133
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,140
Miss Luo, please keep this between us.

134
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,780
Don't tell anyone, okay?

135
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,090
Yes.

136
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,690
Thank you.

137
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,940
Is she here for you?

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,300
I don't think so.

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,210
Be careful.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
Don't ruin our master's plan.

141
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,970
Yes.

142
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,800
Could that female ghost be Leng Moyan's accomplice?

143
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,960
Should I go back to the Department and report it to Commander?

144
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,920
Commander, according to my plan,

145
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,130
we will catch him without risks.

146
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,600
No.

147
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,290
If it were easy to catch him,

148
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,380
we wouldn't have wasted so much time.

149
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,060
We must think of a perfect way

150
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,090
to win in one shot.

151
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,600
If something went wrong

152
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
and it let him have a chance to fight back,

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,010
we would be doomed.

154
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm back.

155
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,480
Shiqi is back.

156
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,390
How's the investigation going?

157
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,170
It is progressing.

158
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,400
I found...

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,420
I found that...

160
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,270
What could you have found?

161
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,640
I said you were too young.

162
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,409
You couldn't catch up with us this time.

163
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,900
We've come up with a plan.

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,760
We're working on how to catch him.

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,130
Catch whom?

166
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,370
I interrogated the Commander of the guards in Prince Jing's Residence.

167
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,800
I found that the Investigation Bureau

168
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,730
removed the guard at the back gate under the excuse of administration.

169
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,370
Look.

170
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,060
The female thief ran away through the back gate in the backyard.

171
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,720
It is the Investigation Bureau.

172
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,070
Is it really him?

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,610
You also found similar clues?

174
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,170
Yes.

175
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,610
The Investigation Bureau is sophisticated.

176
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,690
We must arrest Leng Moyan first

177
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,830
and interrogate him immediately.

178
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,360
We can't give him time to erase the evidence.

179
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,810
Yes.

180
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,600
That's the only hope.

181
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,090
Yes, as the saying goes, bait must be prepared when you go fishing.

182
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,590
You need to take risks to get what you want.

183
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,010
We've decided

184
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,360
to set a honey trap.

185
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,780
A honey trap for a eunuch?

186
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,270
Yes.

187
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,640
It is so exciting.

188
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,330
Who will be the bait?

189
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,920
Me?

190
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Impossible!

191
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,800
He is a eunuch.

192
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,350
How could he like women?

193
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,200
What's the use of me going there?

194
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,920
It doesn't matter.

195
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
None of us

196
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,880
has ever treated you as a woman.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
Thank you so much!

198
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,190
Hey.

199
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
Shiqi, think about it.

200
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,390
Leng Moyan has always been merciless and cruel.

201
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,220
But he kept showing mercy to you.

202
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,930
In my opinion,

203
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,770
he must have fallen in love with you.

204
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,190
Impossible.

205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,290
He doesn't even fall in love with a beautiful princess.

206
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,160
How can it be possible that he likes me?

207
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,910
You have to believe in your charm.

208
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
He is a eunuch, but he is also a human being.

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,640
He has feelings and desires too.

210
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,230
Yes.

211
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,370
Does he?

212
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,600
What are you doing, Leng Moyan?

213
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,560
You're already mine.

214
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,530
Of course.

215
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,920
Think about it.

216
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,340
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

217
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,610
That's impossible.

218
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,110
Why are you overreacting?

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,530
Find another way.

220
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,140
I need to check some clues.

221
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm leaving.

222
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,470
Shisan.

223
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
Come back.

224
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,770
Shiqi, for the peace of the world

225
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,490
and the well-being of the people,

226
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,930
you must shoulder your responsibilities.

227
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,490
The spirit of Secret Guards!

228
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,780
Will last forever.

229
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,620
Great.

230
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,590
It's the Qixi Festival tomorrow.

231
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,150
It's a great opportunity.

232
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,210
Shisan, thank you so much.

233
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,480
You're indeed...

234
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,400
Hey.

235
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,900
You can go without worry.

236
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,260
All of us will support you.

237
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,260
These guys are extremely weird.

238
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,490
How could they ask me to seduce a eunuch?

239
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,530
They even said I didn't look like a woman because I didn't wear makeup.

240
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,800
Look what they have prepared for me.

241
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,870
What is this?

242
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,460
How can I use it?

243
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,590
Seducing him seems even harder than poisoning him.

244
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,970
And there's a letter.

245
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,940
I made a bowl of soup for you with care and love.

246
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,010
I am obsessed with your talent and miss you day and night.

247
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,520
There's a secret place for lovers.

248
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,410
Will you come tonight, my love?

249
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,010
And they wanted me

250
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,600
to read such a disgusting love letter to that eunuch.

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,660
I would rather die.

252
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,780
These people

253
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,090
are sanctimonious.

254
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,970
How could they write something so disgusting?

255
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,060
I'd rather write it myself.

256
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,160
But how?

257
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,210
It's okay. Mei Shiqi, you can do it.

258
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,230
There's nothing you can't do.

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,290
Why did I dream of him again?

260
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,990
It was a little bit romantic.

261
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,940
Why is my face so hot?

262
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,370
Do I really like that stinky fox?

263
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,330
Impossible.

264
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,320
He doesn't meet my requirements at all.

265
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Is he gentle and elegant?

266
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,890
No.

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,690
Is he erudite?

268
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,410
No.

269
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,240
Is he easy to get close to?

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
Not at all.

271
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,360
I won't write him a love letter

272
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,120
even for the sake of getting promoted.

273
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,440
[Investigation Bureau]

274
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,400
My lord, I've found it out.

275
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,590
Lotus Wonderland is quite powerful.

276
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,320
Most of the family members of the ministers and officials of the six departments

277
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,690
have invested in it.

278
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,690
I knew it.

279
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,100
Princess Jing used this method

280
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,680
to have a financial connection with other officials

281
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,710
and shared weal and woe with them.

282
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,570
They must have other properties.

283
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,840
Have you investigated the four Oirans?

284
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,880
Regarding the two who went to the birthday banquet,

285
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,080
Miss Song has been confirmed innocent,

286
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,090
while Miss Zhao went back to her hometown.

287
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,750
I've sent someone to her hometown to summon her.

288
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,520
Speed up.

289
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,080
I have a bad feeling.

290
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,340
We've exposed ourselves.

291
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,920
Our opponents could be one step ahead of us.

292
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,120
The Secret Guards Department seems to be investigating us secretly.

293
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,690
Keep an eye on Prince Jing's Residence

294
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,620
and the Secret Guards Department. Don't let them...

295
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,280
At 7 p.m. tomorrow

296
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,010
at the West Pavilion in the north of the city.

297
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,580
It's up to you to come or not.

298
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,860
Who is so arrogant?

299
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,890
I'll go after him.

300
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,140
It's Mei Shiqi.

301
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,970
Mei Shiqi?

302
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,890
Why can't she say it now?

303
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,140
Why should you meet secretly

304
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,340
at the West Pavilion?

305
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,940
Wait, tomorrow is the Qixi Festival, my lord.

306
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,970
Is she asking you out for a private date?

307
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,090
My lord,

308
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,010
you are so charming.

309
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,740
Ridiculous.

310
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,870
There is no progress in the ambush case.

311
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,680
The female thief is still on the run.

312
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,130
I don't have any time to think about date.

313
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,250
Besides,

314
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,000
didn't you hear what she wrote?

315
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,920
I won't go.

316
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
You are loyal to the government.

317
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,530
You've worked hard for the country and the people.

318
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,120
I really admire you.

319
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,500
My lord, is this the place?

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,590
Is this the legendary place for a rendezvous in the suburbs of the capital,

321
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,990
the West Pavilion for lovers?

322
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,860
Step back.

323
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,390
More steps backwards.

324
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,980
Do you want to be punished?

325
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,130
I have to stay here to protect you, my lord.

326
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,040
What if she tries to harass you?

327
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,930
I promise I will...

328
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,330
I won't do anything.
